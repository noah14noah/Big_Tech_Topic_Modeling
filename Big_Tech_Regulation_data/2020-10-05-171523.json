Facebook is facing an increasing advertising boycott, and Google has discovered it's not immune to the general ad downturn. Are we getting closer to the limit of the big tech platforms' power?  The US-based campaign to encourage advertisers to boycott Facebook (at least through July) mushroomed over the weekend, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/business/media/Facebook-advertising-boycott.html\">major advertisers</url>like telecommunications giant Verizon, consumer cultural icons like Coca-Cola and Starbucks, and consumer goods market leader Unilever joining in -- in Unilever's case until the end of the year.  Facebook is caught between the dollars of its advertisers today and its eagerness to avoid regulation tomorrow. Google, however, faces the challenge of monopoly when there's limited room to grow. Facebook under fire<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stophateforprofit.org/\">#StopHateForProfit</url> -- launched on June 17 -- brought together traditional US civil rights and anti-racism groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with campaigning groups like <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/slpng_giants?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Sleeping Giants</url> to force Facebook to prevent its platforms being used for hate speech.\u00a0   These latest companies to drop their ad spend are big players: Verizon is a top 20 company by US revenues; Coca-Cola has set advertising trends since the days of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mad Men</emphasis>.   It's clear that corporate America is joining the boycott to get as close as possible to the right side of history in the cultural reset driven by the Black Lives Matter moment. </p><p>It's a recognition that the successful gaming of Facebook's algorithm by right-wing hate groups makes that desire incompatible with advertising on the platform.  This couldn't be put clearer than the comment by Unilever's executive vice president of global media, Luis Di Como, to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Wall Street Journal</emphasis>:  </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The complexities of the current cultural landscape have placed a renewed responsibility on brands to learn, respond and act to drive a trusted and safe digital ecosystem.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> In the age of social responsibility in marketing, the brands of both advertisers and advertising platforms reflect on each other, for good and ill. In that world, Facebook is now a risk -- made riskier by its links with Trump and his supporters. The bigger picture Last week<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> The</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New York Times</emphasis> media columnist Ben Smith <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/business/media/facebook-donald-trump-mark-zuckerberg.html?utm_source=Splice+Slugs&amp;utm_campaign=952344fad1-Slugs+250&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_bbbf816981-952344fad1-230772889&amp;mc_cid=952344fad1&amp;mc_eid=bb3cf1ad7f\">suggested</url>Facebook is constrained by an implicit deal between Trump and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to keep out of each other's way: Facebook will allow the Trump re-election campaign more or less free rein on the platform that was so important in the 2016 election, while the Trump administration will resist calls for tighter regulation.   Zuckerberg has already expressed his concerns about the threat of regulation from an incoming Democratic administration.   Facebook has also stumbled in its boycott response. It took until Friday US time to announce a minor shift from its repeated declarations that it would not moderate political speech, even when as provocative as Trump's. Now, it will start labelling political speech that violates its rules and will act to prevent voter suppression and moderate hate speech.   Too little, too late to prevent the boycott building steam.  Ultimately, Facebook is constrained by its governance. Using a dual share ownership model allowable under US law, Zuckerberg retains majority control although most of the capital comes from non-voting shares. This means there's unlikely to be meaningful change until Zuckerberg decides the risk of long-term advertising losses outweighs the danger of regulation by either Trump or a Biden administration. That could be some time.  Meanwhile, Google has its own troubles. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-u-s-ad-revenue-is-expected-to-decline-in-2020-emarketer-says-11592830801\">The Wall Street Journal reports</url> that Google's ad revenue is expected to fall in 2020 for the first time. It seems to have a larger scaled version of the problem facing <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The SMH</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis>: an over-reliance on travel ads in its core search function.   While the Facebook boycott is generating more news (thanks to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">schadenfreude</emphasis> of traditional media), both stories suggest we're getting close to peak unregulated platforms. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609F-DTR1-JD6R-T52T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><timeReceived>08:32:55 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The US-based campaign to encourage advertisers to boycott Facebook (at least through July) mushroomed over the weekend, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/business/media/Facebook-advertising-boycott.html\">major advertisers</url>like telecommunications giant Verizon, consumer cultural icons like Coca-Cola and Starbucks, and consumer goods market leader Unilever joining in -- in Unilever's case until the end of the year.

Zuckerberg has already expressed his concerns about the threat of regulation from an incoming Democratic administration.   Facebook has also stumbled in its boycott response. It took until Friday US time to announce a minor shift from its repeated declarations that it would not moderate political speech, even when as provocative as Trump's. Now, it will start labelling political speech that violates its rules and will act to prevent voter suppression and moderate hate speech.   Too little, too late to prevent the boycott building steam.  Ultimately, Facebook is constrained by its governance. Using a dual share ownership model allowable under US law, Zuckerberg retains majority control although most of the capital comes from non-voting shares. This means there's unlikely to be meaningful change until Zuckerberg decides the risk of long-term advertising losses outweighs the danger of regulation by either Trump or a Biden administration. That could be some time.

While the Facebook boycott is generating more news (thanks to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">schadenfreude</emphasis> of traditional media), both stories suggest we're getting close to peak unregulated platforms. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6085-8FB1-JD6R-T0HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><timeReceived>08:32:55 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Meanwhile, Google has its own troubles. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-u-s-ad-revenue-is-expected-to-decline-in-2020-emarketer-says-11592830801\">The Wall Street Journal reports</url> that Google's ad revenue is expected to fall in 2020 for the first time. It seems to have a larger scaled version of the problem facing <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The SMH</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis>: an over-reliance on travel ads in its core search function.   While the Facebook boycott is generating more news (thanks to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">schadenfreude</emphasis> of traditional media), both stories suggest we're getting close to peak unregulated platforms. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6097-FM51-JD6R-T4DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><timeReceived>08:32:55 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And when it comes to their banking, many people want personalisation and convenience, even if that doesn't always seem possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That could be just one of the many reasons millennials in particular say they would be prepared to use firms like Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebookfor their banking services. They are used to the one-click convenience and want it replicated across other services they use.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The company MuleSoft surveyed more than 8,000 people across the world and discovered that 52 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds say they would consider banking with Facebookor another tech giant they use regularly. And third of all age groups agreed.</p><p>They said they wanted simplicity and convenience, plus a more personalised service. Despite recent data concerns, it appears we want our banking to be as modern as our Instagram account.</p><p>Could it happen?</p><p>Shashi Nirale, senior vice-president at customer experience management firm Servion, says he can clearly see a route into banking for the tech giants.</p><p>\"The likes of Apple, Googleand Samsung already have mature payment and peer-to-peer solutions on offer,\" he says, \"so it's not a stretch at all to imagine them offering current accounts or loans and mortgages in the future.</p><p>\"A company like Amazon, for example, already has the customer base and importantly, all the data it needs on those customers to offer personalised banking products with ease.\"</p><p>Of course, tech giants won't be able to offer high street banking services but then, for a lot of people, neither do high street banks. A recent survey from Which? found that UK bank branch closures are reaching an \"alarming\" rate of 60 a month.</p><p>At the same time, digital-only challenger banks such as Monzo and Starling Bank are growing in popularity, powered by their mobile and tech-first attitude.</p><p>On top of that, the recent Open Banking regulations mean that customers can ask their banks to share financial data with regulated third party companies.</p><p>It's designed to ensure customers own their data and can share it with firms who will use it to help them manage their finances.</p><p>And that means almost a barrier-free entry into banking for the tech giants if they decided to so flex their muscles.</p><p>Privacy fears</p><p>Of course, given a slew of recent data concerns, some might argue that customers will not be willing to trust big tech firms with their private banking transactions.</p><p>The truth is that convenience trumps privacy fears.</p><p>\"The question for millennials is: why wouldn't they?\" suggests Nirale. \"This demographic already operates much of its life within the ecosystem of a company like Googleor Apple, so if it's convenient and intuitive, using those companies for banking would be no different at all.</p><p>\"Ultimately, convenience will win out over concerns about security, just take a look at how much data younger consumers are willing to give up to major players so they can access the latest services and offers.</p><p>\"The fact is, banking services and apps from major tech firms are likely to be far better integrated with the lifestyle of a millennial using an Apple or Android device than anything a Lloyds or Barclays could offer, and customers would be drawn to the fluid experience over and above concerns about security.\"</p><p>Ethically speaking</p><p>One thing that might hamper the bigger tech firms, or at least give fintech startups the edge, is a growing focus on ethics from younger banking customers.</p><p>A recent report into the future of money carried out in the US and China by the Innovation Group at J Walter Thompson Intelligence, shows that 76 per cent of Chinese and 65 per cent of US consumers say ethical behaviour is important when choosing a financial institution. It found growing demand for banks to have a social good or an ethical stance baked into their business models.</p><p>Concerns over Facebook's use of data, for example, might put millennials off banking with them because of ethical concerns rather than privacy worries.</p><p>Of course, as yet, this is all speculation. But many bankers expect that further disruption of some sort is coming; payments technology firm Auka published a survey of European bankers earlier this year and found that a third believe that new data laws will drive a \"fundamental\" banking shift over the next five years. More than a quarter said they expect Facebook, Google and Amazonto take the role of banks during that time.</p><p>Lucie Greene, worldwide director of the Innovation Group, said: \"The financial sector is going through a period of unprecedented change, presenting massive opportunities and also challenges to traditional institutions.</p><p>\"Consumers are adopting new behaviours en masse, including peer-to-peer payments, digital-first banks, cryptocurrencies and more. They expect more not only from bank brands' services and ethics, but also from their curb appeal and branding.</p><p>For some, the implications of Big Tech moving into banking go far beyond worries they might personalise your advertising or that their ethics might not be up to scratch.</p><p>Earlier this year, Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez, executive chairman of Spanish bank BBVA warned that companies like Facebookand Amazon could \"replace many banks\" and demanded that global action is taken to ensure they are subject to sufficient regulation so that they do not pose a threat to international financial stability.</p><p>Companies like Amazon and Apple have the opportunity, they have the technology and they have the ability to invest. Whatever that might mean for global financial stability and regulation, they could certainly rock the business stability of traditional banks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000030798281-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SMF-TN41-F072-426J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 23, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000DLGA</classCode><className>MULESOFT INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the biggest hazard of all is monopolistic cloud providers. Financial companies and government agencies' dependence on these providers, which lack the same capital and operational resiliency requirements that are imposed on systemically important financial institutions, could prove to be a weak point that endangers the entire economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"What if, for example, not only the private financial system but the Fed also were reliant on a cloud service provider? Not only could the system blow but the Fed's ability to interact with it could go, too,\" said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics and the paper's author, in an interview. \"It's a classic concentration risk, but it's in the critical infrastructure.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Petrou sees a parallel between the events leading up to the mortgage crisis of 2008 and what's going on in fintech today.</p><p>\"Industry regulators recognize there are significant benefits to fintech innovation; It's not only really cool, but often really useful,\" she said. \"And everybody is afraid to monkey with it, much as in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, everyone was afraid to do anything meaningful about mortgage regulation because of the American dream of home ownership. Now we have an American ideal of technological innovation, but nothing is that perfect. Nothing is risk free.\"</p><p>Fintech risks</p><p>The paper also examines the risk from fintechs' role in \"virtualized finance,\" where a financial transaction is fully electronic from inception to termination, such as a Venmo payment.</p><p>\"Virtualizing financial risk by housing it in fintech companies does not change the fundamental nature of actual risk,\" Petrou wrote. \"Most tectonic shifts of this magnitude end in earthquakes.\"</p><p>Banks are required to attempt to make customers whole when there's an electronic snafu, but fintechs are not so obligated.</p><p>\"In a bank transaction, not only is there the equivalent of a paper trail... but there's also legal liability,\" Petrou said. \"That's a big issue when you get into virtualized finance with fintechs. Who is liable for what?\"</p><p>One example could be Michael Terpin's case against AT&amp;T. Terpin says he had $24 million worth of digital currency stolen from his mobile phone by criminals who were able to trick AT&amp;T store employees into forwarding Terpin's communications to their cell phone (after reportedly trying and failing 11 times). In the case of erroneous money transfers, banks have to make customers whole according to Reg E. Phone companies are not subject to Reg E, however.</p><p>Because fintechs do not face capital requirements, they may not be able to withstand a massive fraud, Petrou said.</p><p>\"When a regulated financial provider with capital at risk owns customer personally identifiable information or similarly sensitive data, it has the resources with which to make good on fraudulent, data breach, or similarly problematic transactions such as those for which current U.S. law assigns principal liability to the financial provider,\" Petrou wrote. \"In the event of large-scale disruption to a payment provider such as Venmo or to a non-bank payment service (e.g., Amazon), funds may be available for minor disruptions, but deep pockets for sustained losses are uncertain even at giant platform companies with no clear legal obligation to make customers whole in the event of system breaches or widespread infrastructure damage.\"</p><p>There's also the risk that fintechs could misuse customer data.</p><p>\"Many fintech business models are based on or offered in concert with services that offer free products (e.g., contact networks, search capacity) in return for rights to use data in ways (e.g., monitoring browsing to price credit) little understood and often undisclosed to consumers,\" Petrou wrote.</p><p>Fintechs can use this information to \"up-price\" financial products or \"limit offerings in exclusionary or even discriminatory ways.\"</p><p>Senators have suggested disclosure rules and opt-out rights for consumers, but Petrou said disclosures have long been an ineffective method to enhance consumer protection.</p><p>Such risks can be exacerbated by unregulated fintechs' use of artificial intelligence in their decision-making, she said. This can lead to what Petrou calls \"opacity\" and some people refer to as the \"black box\" problem.</p><p>\"Banks are required to keep careful documentation on and then to validate their underwriting and product-offering procedures,\" she wrote. \"Absent any effort by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to assert authority, no such examination or documentation requirements apply to fintech services, making it difficult to evaluate systems to determine if problematic outcomes are the result of market factors or illegal and improper actions.\"</p><p>A lack of transparency could lead to unseen forms of discrimination, she warned.</p><p>\"The ability of platform companies to \"~micro-target' offerings or financial-product advertisements to selected groups is also of significant concern,\" Petrou wrote. \"Online marketplace lending that uses credit underwriting models based on factors such as university attended are also likely to have very disparate impact on lower-wealth borrowers.\"</p><p>A virtualized risk mitigation framework that applied equally to all parties would reduce these risks, Petrou suggested.</p><p>Fintechs often say they are already heavily regulated by state regulators, the CFPB and other entities, but Petrou said it's not close to the same as what banks face.</p><p>\"They have no clue what heavily regulated means,\" she said. \"They think they are because they have to comply with state licensing requirements, but there's no capital regulation, there's no operational resilience regulation. The regulation that applies outside the banking model is largely around business conduct, i.e., do you have a criminal record. It is not prudential and nothing like what the banks have.\"</p><p>The CFPB, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are not prudential regulators, she noted. They don't pay attention to capital levels, backup, security and other areas where a failure could bring a company down.</p><p>The fixes</p><p>In her paper, Petrou acknowledged that \"heavy-handed regulation suppresses innovation and efficiency, but light-touch rules premised on the need to advance innovation and competitiveness have a dismal record of stoking financial crises.\"</p><p>One answer, she said, is to require fintech and tech companies to meet information fiduciary obligations. This means they would have to have \"operational living wills\" or plans for recovery and resolution in the case of something going very wrong.</p><p>\"If you have critical infrastructure like cloud service providers - three firms on which the entire global financial ecosystem is coming to depend - regulators need to ensure it has the same operational resiliency or hopefully better than electric utilities,\" Petrou said.</p><p>The information fiduciary responsibility would also include the need to protect customers' data. This part might look something like the European Union's General Data Protection Rule, with its requirements for data security, just-in-time consent, data portability and the right to be erased, among other things.</p><p>An information fiduciary would need to give consumers the opportunity to make an informed decision between getting a service free while giving away their personal data or paying for the service but keeping their information private, Petrou said. Such a model would also have to be enforceable.</p><p>\"I have zero faith in good conduct pledges,\" she said. \"When there's an enforcement risk, companies are much better at self-policing and risk management. When there's no downside, there's no reason to put costly risk management systems in place.\"</p><p>More controversially, she argued that large tech companies that are a part of the financial services world should be regulated like water and electric companies.</p><p>\"A utility regulatory model means you make money but you are required to operate in a sustained, durable way in the interests of your customers and the broader economy that depends on you,\" Petrou said.</p><p>But though she sees the largest tech and fintech companies as the biggest threats, Petrou doesn't give small fintechs a pass either.</p><p>\"I want to be sure the small guys are still subject to robust anti-discrimination and equal access standards, including for the disabled,\" she said. \"Just because they're little doesn't mean they can pick and choose who they want to serve regardless of the various laws.\"</p><p>Petrou's aim, she said, is to \"ring the gong\" about a spectrum of risks from the potential for credit discrimination, unequal access in the provision of critical financial services, up to the potential for profound systemic disruption.</p><p>\"I don't think we're thinking enough about them,\" she said.</p><p>Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com\">atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000165-ab6b-d33e-a5ed-af7f71f20000-173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6N-D651-JCRW-501Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia, Inc.

Phone companies are not subject to Reg E, however.</p><p>Because fintechs do not face capital requirements, they may not be able to withstand a massive fraud, Petrou said.</p><p>\"When a regulated financial provider with capital at risk owns customer personally identifiable information or similarly sensitive data, it has the resources with which to make good on fraudulent, data breach, or similarly problematic transactions such as those for which current U.S. law assigns principal liability to the financial provider,\" Petrou wrote. \"In the event of large-scale disruption to a payment provider such as Venmo or to a non-bank payment service (e.g., Amazon), funds may be available for minor disruptions, but deep pockets for sustained losses are uncertain even at giant platform companies with no clear legal obligation to make customers whole in the event of system breaches or widespread infrastructure damage.\"</p><p>There's also the risk that fintechs could misuse customer data.</p><p>\"Many fintech business models are based on or offered in concert with services that offer free products (e.g., contact networks, search capacity) in return for rights to use data in ways (e.g., monitoring browsing to price credit) little understood and often undisclosed to consumers,\" Petrou wrote.</p><p>Fintechs can use this information to \"up-price\" financial products or \"limit offerings in exclusionary or even discriminatory ways.\"</p><p>Senators have suggested disclosure rules and opt-out rights for consumers, but Petrou said disclosures have long been an ineffective method to enhance consumer protection.</p><p>Such risks can be exacerbated by unregulated fintechs' use of artificial intelligence in their decision-making, she said. This can lead to what Petrou calls \"opacity\" and some people refer to as the \"black box\" problem.</p><p>\"Banks are required to keep careful documentation on and then to validate their underwriting and product-offering procedures,\" she wrote. \"Absent any effort by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to assert authority, no such examination or documentation requirements apply to fintech services, making it difficult to evaluate systems to determine if problematic outcomes are the result of market factors or illegal and improper actions.\"</p><p>A lack of transparency could lead to unseen forms of discrimination, she warned.</p><p>\"The ability of platform companies to \"~micro-target' offerings or financial-product advertisements to selected groups is also of significant concern,\" Petrou wrote. \"Online marketplace lending that uses credit underwriting models based on factors such as university attended are also likely to have very disparate impact on lower-wealth borrowers.\"</p><p>A virtualized risk mitigation framework that applied equally to all parties would reduce these risks, Petrou suggested.</p><p>Fintechs often say they are already heavily regulated by state regulators, the CFPB and other entities, but Petrou said it's not close to the same as what banks face.</p><p>\"They have no clue what heavily regulated means,\" she said. \"They think they are because they have to comply with state licensing requirements, but there's no capital regulation, there's no operational resilience regulation. The regulation that applies outside the banking model is largely around business conduct, i.e., do you have a criminal record. It is not prudential and nothing like what the banks have.\"</p><p>The CFPB, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are not prudential regulators, she noted. They don't pay attention to capital levels, backup, security and other areas where a failure could bring a company down.</p><p>The fixes</p><p>In her paper, Petrou acknowledged that \"heavy-handed regulation suppresses innovation and efficiency, but light-touch rules premised on the need to advance innovation and competitiveness have a dismal record of stoking financial crises.\"</p><p>One answer, she said, is to require fintech and tech companies to meet information fiduciary obligations. This means they would have to have \"operational living wills\" or plans for recovery and resolution in the case of something going very wrong.</p><p>\"If you have critical infrastructure like cloud service providers - three firms on which the entire global financial ecosystem is coming to depend - regulators need to ensure it has the same operational resiliency or hopefully better than electric utilities,\" Petrou said.</p><p>The information fiduciary responsibility would also include the need to protect customers' data. This part might look something like the European Union's General Data Protection Rule, with its requirements for data security, just-in-time consent, data portability and the right to be erased, among other things.</p><p>An information fiduciary would need to give consumers the opportunity to make an informed decision between getting a service free while giving away their personal data or paying for the service but keeping their information private, Petrou said. Such a model would also have to be enforceable.</p><p>\"I have zero faith in good conduct pledges,\" she said. \"When there's an enforcement risk, companies are much better at self-policing and risk management. When there's no downside, there's no reason to put costly risk management systems in place.\"</p><p>More controversially, she argued that large tech companies that are a part of the financial services world should be regulated like water and electric companies.</p><p>\"A utility regulatory model means you make money but you are required to operate in a sustained, durable way in the interests of your customers and the broader economy that depends on you,\" Petrou said.</p><p>But though she sees the largest tech and fintech companies as the biggest threats, Petrou doesn't give small fintechs a pass either.</p><p>\"I want to be sure the small guys are still subject to robust anti-discrimination and equal access standards, including for the disabled,\" she said. \"Just because they're little doesn't mean they can pick and choose who they want to serve regardless of the various laws.\"</p><p>Petrou's aim, she said, is to \"ring the gong\" about a spectrum of risks from the potential for credit discrimination, unequal access in the provision of critical financial services, up to the potential for profound systemic disruption.</p><p>\"I don't think we're thinking enough about them,\" she said.</p><p>Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com\">atpenny.crosman@sourcemedia.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000165-ab6b-d33e-a5ed-af7f71f20000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6J-CS41-JCRW-54KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

ILCs have faced their own set of questions over the years, but unlike other types of licenses they are popular with companies not typically thought of as banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And with the Federal Reserve Boardspeculated to be a complicating factorin whether the new OCC charter takes off, observers say firms could give the ILC another look. The Fed is said to be resisting the idea that fintech firms receiving the new OCC charter should gain entry to the payments system or have the same access as banks to the Fed's discount window.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The lack of certainty on where the Fed stands on key issues - like the application of the Bank Holding Company Act or what it might charge a fintech to become a bank - could drive fintechs to explore the ILC charter,\" said Sam Taussig, head of global policy at Kabbage, an online small-business lending platform. \"Certainly, the ILC charter has its own challenges, but it may be an attractive option depending on the fintech's business model.\"</p><p>The difficulty for fintech firms trying to avoid 50 state chartering regimes is how to avoid the full set of regulatory hassles of being a commercial bank but still enjoy certain benefits of a federal charter.</p><p>Despite state regulators' legal challenge of the OCC's special-purpose charter, the new license is viewed by the industry as a potential happy medium. But if the Fed ultimately decides not to allow OCC-licensed companies into the payments system, it could undermine one of the perceived advantages, observers say.</p><p>In contrast, ILCs - for all the controversy that has surrounded them since Walmart's failed attempt to own one - might offer more certainty. While they are supervised like banks, ILC parents are exempt from bank holding rules (meaning nonfinancial firms can own them). And their access to the federal safety net - including federal deposit insurance and the payments system - is unquestioned.</p><p>\"The markets embrace certainty and predictability, and their absence makes decisions difficult for executives\" when considering a charter, Scott Talbott, senior vice president of government relations at the Electronic Transactions Association, said of questions surrounding the OCC charter. \"The good news is fintech and financial companies have multiple charter options to best suit their business models, like the ILC option. More choices are always better.\"</p><p>During a meeting with reporters, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said it was \"still my expectation\" to have an applicant for the new OCC charter announced in the first quarter. He also dismissed the Fed as a potential stumbling block, saying that fintech firms could still process payment transactions even if they lack direct access to the payments system.</p><p>Still, recent media reports that certain top Fed officials remainresistant to fintechsentering the banking system may have a chilling effect on those considering charter bids.</p><p>To be sure, the ILC charter has had its own set of issues. FDIC approvals have been rare and numerous applicants interested in an ILC - including fintech firms - have recently withdrawn their bids to bolser their applications. The Fed and community banks have historically resisted nonbank companies using the ILC as a way into the banking system.</p><p>Critics of the charter say it blurs the line between commerce and banking and gives loopholes to firms because the charter does not subject ILCs to Bank Holding Company Act requirements.</p><p>\"It's only a matter of time before a really big tech company uses this loophole and that also presents an unlevel playing field with community banks,\" said Christopher Cole, executive vice president and senior regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America.</p><p>But in a notable sign, Square - the payments company led by CEO Jack Dorsey -recently refiled its ILC applicationafter having previously withdrawn, indicating the fintech is serious about obtaining the FDIC's approval. And ever since she was questioned by senators in her nomination hearing, FDIC Chair Jelena McWilliams has shown openness to ruling on new ILC charters.</p><p>The Square bid could be a bellwether; if it is successful, it could lead other firms to pursue the ILC charter.</p><p>\"There's a number of other folks preparing ILC applications and assembling teams. ... So we anticipate some activity in that regard,\" said Howard Headlee, president of the Utah Bankers Association. He added that access to FDIC deposit insurance has been noted as a benefit of the ILC over the OCC charter. \"All those that I've talked to said insured deposits are a critical part of business plan.\"</p><p>Otting said a lack of access to the payments system for firms receiving the OCC charter should not be seen as a roadblock.</p><p>\"I can tell you of the hundreds of meeting I've had with fintechs, not one has brought that issue up as an impediment,\" he said.</p><p>\"Most of these entities that today would apply to be a bank, many of them are operating today as a state-chartered or state-licensed lender. And virtually all of them have a correspondent banking relationship with a large bank that gives them the ability to process checks and send wires.\"</p><p>However, many firms that offer money transfer services say it's far more costly to do so through a banking relationship than if they had direct access to the Fed payment system.</p><p>\"Eliminating a dependency on banks as an access point lowers systematic risk, in the case of bank failure or de-risking,\" Andrew Boyajian, head of banking for North America at TransferWise, said in an emailed statement. \"And, in turn, it lowers the cost of financial services offered by fintechs.\"</p><p>The Fed has so far not directly addressed whether it will allow fintechs into it payments system, its discount window or to become a Fed member bank - all critical components in helping a fintech determine exactly how much it will cost, or save them, in becoming a bank.</p><p>During an American Bar Association conference in Washington Jan. 12 in which the audience questioned other regulators about the Fed's position, an OCC official remained vague but said the Fed will eventually be forced to respond.</p><p>\"Quite honestly . . . and this is my opinion, once we start having some of these charters approved and we go to the Fed membership and the issue about what services are offered, the Fed will be put in position to start opining on those things,\" said Stephen Lybarger, deputy comptroller of licensing at the OCC. \"And that will be further guidance to the industry and even to us.\"</p><p>Fedstaff have indicatedthat they will make a decision on an individual basis as applicants file with the OCC.</p><p>\"The Federal Reserve staff has been coordinating closely with the OCC on this charter issue. And we're trying to follow all the related developments,\" said Jeff Ernst, senior fintech risk manager at the Fed, during a Sept. 6 fintech conference in Washington.</p><p>When asked about ILCs, Otting said he was open to them if they steered consumers to better options within the banking system, noting how people were forced into \"bad\" payday loans the last time regulators clamped down on banks in the small-dollar lending space. (As a member of the FDIC board of directors, Otting could potentially have a say on ILC applications.)</p><p>\"I would be very much interested in pursuing\" ILCs \"if I thought that they would bring more choice to consumers and small businesses,\" Otting said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000168-6264-d9a0-a16e-767f1b920000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7Y-J051-F06X-W0SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1283\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

But new systems, processes and types of businesses will bring with them novel fragilities.\"</p><p>In response, Quarles said, the Financial Stability Board has \"started to examine in greater detail\" the potential effects of big tech firms entering the banking system and how technologies are decentralizing financial transaction by no longer requiring an intermediary.</p><p>These two effects \"raise a number of issues, some of which may touch on financial stability,\" he said. \"We hope to offer some answers to these questions in the coming years. ... We will address the questions with discipline and analytical rigor in a way that incorporates the views of the public and key stakeholders and that results in answers that are practical and intelligible.\"</p><p>For some in the banking industry, the remarks served as a warning to big tech firms, particularly as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. weigh bank charters for fintech firms in the U.S.</p><p>Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, said the concerns raised by Quarles, particularly about large tech firms entering the payments system, must be addressed by the stability board on a global level and by the Fed in the U.S.</p><p>\"The big tech platform companies are not only pressuring to get in the Fed payments system, but several are already providing core infrastructure more globally ... where the FSB fears a natural oligopoly,\" she said. \"It is very significant payments system risk.\"</p><p>The Independent Community Bankers of America said that it \"agrees with Chairman Quarles that while technological innovation promises a more efficient financial system, monolithic tech firms and the decentralization of financial transactions pose risks to financial stability,\" ICBA President and CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey said in a statement released Thursday after Quarles' remarks.</p><p>The ICBA further said Quarles' speech gives cause for the FDIC to place another moratorium on allowing firms to become industrial loan companies, or ILCs. Fintech firmsincluding Squarehave pending ILC applications with the FDIC.</p><p>But the agency has not approved an ILC in more than a decade, partly because it could allow commerce to mix with banking, which is particularly concerning for the ICBA as e-commerce giants like Amazon are entering the financial business. The ILC charter also exempts the firm from bank holding company requirements, which bankers argue puts traditional banks at a disadvantage.</p><p>\"The ILC loophole allows commercial interests to own full-service banks while avoiding key regulations and consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve-threatening the financial system, creating an uneven regulatory playing field, and violating the longstanding U.S. policy of separating banking and commerce,\" Rainey said in her statement. \"In this era of big data, tech conglomerates, and artificial intelligence, we should stop and think before giving massive tech companies further reach into the economic lives of Americans.\"</p><p>Quarles did not specifically address ILCs in his speech, but sources say the Fed has long been concerned about the holding company exemption. Quarles' speech also mirrored a report the FSB released in February that raised concerns about the power big tech firms could gain in the financial system.</p><p>These concerns are similar to what \"the ICBA is raising in that big tech firms have the ability to use social media and other technology to help tailor offerings to individuals that would give big tech firms strong financial positions to be very effective competitors,\" said Thomas Curry, a partner at Nutter McClennen &amp; Fish LLP and former comptroller of the currency.</p><p>Still, other observers downplayed the Fed official's remarks, arguing that they were less about stopping fintechs from becoming banks or ILCs and more about taking a reasonable approach to regulating fintechs within the financial system.</p><p>\"I thought it was quite positive on fintechs,\" said Jo Ann Barefoot, co-founder of Hummingbird Regtech and a former deputy comptroller of the currency. Quarles gave \"a good statement that the Fed does recognize the upside opportunities for financial innovation and will be careful not to undermine that as the FSB addresses its necessary task.\"</p><p>In his speech, Quarles underscored that global regulators \"are not trying to oppose innovation.\"</p><p>\"Innovation, including fintech, offers the world many potential benefits,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000169-dbca-d0b4-affd-ffcef0d90000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSX-B0V1-F06X-W29Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

But new systems, processes and types of businesses will bring with them novel fragilities.\"</p><p>In response, Quarles said, the Financial Stability Board has \"started to examine in greater detail\" the potential effects of big tech firms entering the banking system and how technologies are decentralizing financial transaction by no longer requiring an intermediary.</p><p>These two effects \"raise a number of issues, some of which may touch on financial stability,\" he said. \"We hope to offer some answers to these questions in the coming years. ... We will address the questions with discipline and analytical rigor in a way that incorporates the views of the public and key stakeholders and that results in answers that are practical and intelligible.\"</p><p>For some in the banking industry, the remarks served as a warning to big tech firms, particularly as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. weigh bank charters for fintech firms in the U.S.</p><p>Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, said the concerns raised by Quarles, particularly about large tech firms entering the payments system, must be addressed by the stability board on a global level and by the Fed in the U.S.</p><p>\"The big tech platform companies are not only pressuring to get in the Fed payments system, but several are already providing core infrastructure more globally ... where the FSB fears a natural oligopoly,\" she said. \"It is very significant payments system risk.\"</p><p>The Independent Community Bankers of America said that it \"agrees with Chairman Quarles that while technological innovation promises a more efficient financial system, monolithic tech firms and the decentralization of financial transactions pose risks to financial stability,\" ICBA President and CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey said in a statement released Thursday after Quarles' remarks.</p><p>The ICBA further said Quarles' speech gives cause for the FDIC to place another moratorium on allowing firms to become industrial loan companies, or ILCs. Fintech firmsincluding Squarehave pending ILC applications with the FDIC.</p><p>But the agency has not approved an ILC in more than a decade, partly because it could allow commerce to mix with banking, which is particularly concerning for the ICBA as e-commerce giants like Amazon are entering the financial business. The ILC charter also exempts the firm from bank holding company requirements, which bankers argue puts traditional banks at a disadvantage.</p><p>\"The ILC loophole allows commercial interests to own full-service banks while avoiding key regulations and consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve-threatening the financial system, creating an uneven regulatory playing field, and violating the longstanding U.S. policy of separating banking and commerce,\" Rainey said in her statement. \"In this era of big data, tech conglomerates, and artificial intelligence, we should stop and think before giving massive tech companies further reach into the economic lives of Americans.\"</p><p>Quarles did not specifically address ILCs in his speech, but sources say the Fed has long been concerned about the holding company exemption. Quarles' speech also mirrored a report the FSB released in February that raised concerns about the power big tech firms could gain in the financial system.</p><p>These concerns are similar to what \"the ICBA is raising in that big tech firms have the ability to use social media and other technology to help tailor offerings to individuals that would give big tech firms strong financial positions to be very effective competitors,\" said Thomas Curry, a partner at Nutter McClennen &amp; Fish LLP and former comptroller of the currency.</p><p>Still, other observers downplayed the Fed official's remarks, arguing that they were less about stopping fintechs from becoming banks or ILCs and more about taking a reasonable approach to regulating fintechs within the financial system.</p><p>\"I thought it was quite positive on fintechs,\" said Jo Ann Barefoot, co-founder of Hummingbird Regtech and a former deputy comptroller of the currency. Quarles gave \"a good statement that the Fed does recognize the upside opportunities for financial innovation and will be careful not to undermine that as the FSB addresses its necessary task.\"</p><p>In his speech, Quarles underscored that global regulators \"are not trying to oppose innovation.\"</p><p>\"Innovation, including fintech, offers the world many potential benefits,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000169-dbca-d0b4-affd-ffcef0d90000-64</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT1-BC61-JCRW-509P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

Last week the S&amp;#38;P 500 closed within 5% of it's pre-Covid-19 high and the NASDAQ reached a new all time high.

One member of the CCG Anti Quarantine Index, Hertz Car Rental, has filed for bankruptcy. Typically, bankruptcy is the end of the line for equity investors but for Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NYSE:HTZ) bankruptcy was the beginning of new chapter in the Hertz story.

Carl Icahn who owned 39% of the company sold his entire stake in Hertz at $0.72 a share, realizing a two-billion-dollar loss. With the stock[3] price near zero and the exit of Icahn, it appeared as if the end was near for Hertz. **I should make clear that this is not a series that'll tell you how to invest, or what to look for. It is only designed to help improve your investing process by observing the processes of some of the world's greatest money managers. Calculating a business's intrinsic value is a key principle of value investing. Read More[4] Bankruptcy by definition results when a company can no longer fulfill its debt obligations. Unfortunately for equity investors, bankruptcy gives priority to collateralized debt holders and bondholders. Shareholders are only entitled to whatever value remains after debt obligations have been met. Consequently the most frequent outcome for shareholders in a bankruptcy is they end up with nothing. Knowing this, one would expect the value of Hertz stock to quickly approach zero following their bankruptcy announcement, but that did not happen. In the two weeks following the announcement Hertz stock[5] rose from a low of $0.55 to a post bankruptcy high of $5.54, a 1,000% gain! This performance begs the question, if an experienced investment professional like Icahn is unloading 39% of Hertz shares under a dollar then who is buying? Data from Robintrack.net, a website which tracks a stocks popularity among investors using the free stock trading app Robinhood, gives some indication of who is buying Hertz. The chart below shows the price of Hertz stock and how many Robinhood accounts held at least one share of Hertz. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hertz-Global.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hertz-Global.png</url> Source: Robintrack.netHertz Stock Drops Due To Covid-19 OutbreakPrior to the Covid outbreak only 1,000 to 2,000 Robinhood accounts held a share of Hertz. Following the Covid-19 outbreak as Hertz Global Holdings stock dropped Robinhood buying accelerated. By the time Hertz announced their bankruptcy 55,000 Robinhood accounts held Hertz stock. By June 15th that number has grown to 174,000. The counterparty to Icahn and other institutional investors rushing to exit the stock was a swarm of enthusiastic new retail buyers. To many, the enthusiasm for Hertz Global Holdings stock from retail investors is perplexing given the likelihood Hertz shares will eventually be worth nothing. The seemingly irrational behavior of retail Hertz buyers however makes more sense given the context of the market. New retail traders have entered a market that has seen the S&amp;#38;P 500[6] gain 40%, setting a new 50-day record. From March 23rd, the day the S&amp;#38;P 500 hit bottom, to June 8th every single stock in the index was up. In short, any new market participants, which there have been many in this run up, have seen nothing but success. Hertz Global Holdings was quick to realize that the retail buying spree presented them with a rare opportunity to cash in on their unexpectedly high stock price by selling an addition 250 million shares of stock. In their statement to the court Hertz said given the recent developments \"Debtors now seek emergency relief from this Court to allow the Debtors to capture the potential value of unissued Hertz shares for the benefit of the Debtors estates.\"Satisfying Debt ObligationsAt first blush its easy to paint Hertz Global Holdings as the villain. Simply put they are selling stock for the sole purpose of satisfying debt obligations. But to be fair, Hertz has been clear regarding the risk of purchasing their new shares. The market has decided there is value in Hertz equity and consequently Hertz has a fiduciary duty to capture that value in order to fulfill as much of their debt obligations as possible. Regulations require that Hertz disclose the risks of owning their stock. Pricing that risk falls on investors. Are retail investors ignoring the many warning signs for the chance to turn a quick profit by selling at a higher price to the next in line? Given the apparent lack of any fundamental value for the stock it is hard to come up with another explanation. In this context one is reminded of John Maynard Keynes who said, 'For it is, so to speak, a game of Snap, of Old Maid, of Musical Chairs \u2014 a pastime in which he is victor who says Snap neither too soon nor too late, who passed the Old Maid to his neighbor before the game is over, who secures a chair for himself when the music stops.' The wise investor should avoid that game entirely, but the attraction of those 1,000% gains is no doubt a great temptation.

Originally published at ValueWalk[1].In the nearly four months since the Covid-19[2] outbreak reached the United States the market has experienced an historic crash and equally historic recovery. Last week the S&amp;#38;P 500 closed within 5% of it's pre-Covid-19 high and the NASDAQ reached a new all time high. </p><p>The market's bounce has largely been driven by big tech, including stocks included in the Cornell Capital Group Quarantine Index which has dramatically outperformed the market. While tech has outperformed, companies in the travel sector, many of which are included in the CCG Anti Quarantine Index, have largely missed out on much of the market recovery. One member of the CCG Anti Quarantine Index, Hertz Car Rental, has filed for bankruptcy. Typically, bankruptcy is the end of the line for equity investors but for Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NYSE:HTZ) bankruptcy was the beginning of new chapter in the Hertz story.

But once lethal autonomous weapons are out in the world, there could be no turning back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that we can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle with lethal autonomous weapon systems,\u201d says Dr Michael Richardson, who was recently named a Top 5 Humanities Researcher by the ABC for his work on drone technologies.</p><p>Dr Richardson, who researches political violence and emerging technologies, says developments in lethal autonomous weapons are accelerating radically. He says these systems are not yet deployed operationally, but there are still several reasons why we should all be concerned.</p><p>\u201cMost of the major militaries around the world are developing lethal autonomous weapons of different kinds, sometimes even in partnership with big tech companies,\u201d says the Senior Research Fellow from UNSW Arts &amp; Social Sciences.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big question \u2013 what does it mean to hand over some of the decision making around violence to machines, and everybody on the planet will have a stake in what happens on this front.\u201d</p><p>Military technologies that are close to being autonomous are already in the field. With the help of drones, distant battles can increasingly be fought from control stations full of screens and interfaces, he says.</p><p>'...the threshold that needs to be crossed is not so much a technological one at this point, it\u2019s a moral one or a strategic one.'</p><p>The real transformation, however, is in \u2018predicting\u2019 threats \u2013 and eliminating them \u2013 before they arise.</p><p>\u201cWith the US military, in particular, lethal drone strikes are carried out based on a determination of whether someone or some group of people might become a threat \u00ad\u2013 that is, they might do [harm] in the future,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIf your threat is someone pointing a gun in your face, the threat is pretty imminent. But someone driving a car around in rural Afghanistan with a rice cooker in the back and a bag of nails \u2026 you might have some data points that would suggest the person is going to create an improvised explosive device that could put troops at risk.</p><p>\u201cIn that instance, the threat is several steps removed from what you\u2019re observing. The person might also just have a new rice cooker and a broken fence to fix. So, you have the potential to kill someone based on a prediction about what might come about, rather than based on anything they\u2019re specifically doing at the time.\u201d</p><p>While militaries are turning to machine-learning algorithms to identify threats before they happen, they\u2019re yet to hand over control to the machine. But Dr Richardson says, that isn\u2019t too far a leap.</p><p>\u201cThe move towards killing that is intensely predictive is certainly happening, and it\u2019s a very scary development,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would have the technological capacity in many instances to take human decision making out of the process and to push those predictions, to the forefront.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t necessarily granted decision making power to those technologies to fire a weapon, but the threshold that needs to be crossed is not so much a technological one at this point, it\u2019s a moral one or a strategic one,\u201d he says.Regulating lethal autonomous weapons</p><p>Dr Richardson says global governance and arms control are among several measures we need to take to restrict lethal autonomous weapons.</p><p>\u201cWhile that didn\u2019t stop the development of nuclear weapons, widespread public opposition could help to hold the development of lethal autonomous weapon systems, or to slow down the production of the technology at least,\u201d he says.Dr Michael Richardson</p><p>Dr Michael Richardson.</p><p>\u201cBut at the moment, lethal autonomous weapon systems are not currently regulated under the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. In fact, there\u2019s not even an accepted and agreed definition of what a lethal autonomous weapon system is.\u201d</p><p>He says Australia is \u2018infrastructurally complicit\u2019 in the development of such technologies with its partnerships with the US military and could push other countries to be more accountable.</p><p>\u201cWe might claim that there\u2019s little we can do to influence the main players in this space, like the US, China and Russia. Nevertheless, Australia is part of that world system.</p><p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s happening \u2018over there\u2019 in terms of kinetic violence, we\u2019re an integral part of this,\u201d he says. \u201cThe kinds of methods of surveillance and control [that] start in military spaces often expand elsewhere, and we\u2019ve certainly seen that since 9/11 with surveillance in particular.\u201d</p><p>Dr Richardson believes the widespread public opposition to nuclear weapons, as well as facial recognition software, shows that it is still possible to slow the development of lethal autonomous weapons.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from widespread adoption and development of facial recognition technologies to major tech companies undertaking a moratorium on their development. That\u2019s a result of sustained public pressure, but also critical pressure from academics and from advocacy groups, who have shown \u2026 they\u2019re deeply problematic and result in greater injustice rather than more justice and safety.</p><p>\u201cIf we can create that push around facial recognition, perhaps we can also push against lethal autonomous weapons. They rely on similar kinds of technologies of automatic detection and recognition but make far more disastrous choices than whether a person gets a job or not, whether they\u2019re allowed inside a venue or not.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3616777</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K2-JHM1-JDG9-Y0KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"913\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Some see the anti-establishment trend as a rejection of centralised power. Others suggest the real hunger is for a moral authority that appears to be lacking in today's capitalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Among the latter group is Slavoj Zizek, a Marxist philosopher at the University of Ljubljana. He criticises the appeal of political correctness, questions the ability of markets to survive without state intervention and excoriates what he sees as the ulterior motives behind fair-trade coffee. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His latest book, \"Like a Thief in Broad Daylight\", explores the changing nature of social progress in what he calls an \"era of post-humanity\". Mr Zizek responded to five questions as part of The Economist's Open Future initiative. His replies are followed by an excerpt from the book. </p><p>*      *      *</p><p>The Economist: What do you mean by \"the era of post-humanity\"? What characterises it?</p><p>Slavoj Zizek: It is not primarily the automatisation and robotisation of the production process but much more the expanding role of science, machines and digital media in social control and regulation. The detailed registration of all our acts and habits enables the digital machine to know ourselves, even our psyche, better than we know ourselves. In this way, social control no longer needs to be exerted in the old \"totalitarian\" mode, through open domination--we are already manipulated and regulated when we act freely, just following our needs and desires. </p><p>But there is another feature which justifies the term \"post-humanity\": the prospect of the direct link between our brain and the digital network. When this happens, we lose the basic distance which makes us human, the distance between external reality and our inner life where we can \"think what we want.\" With my thoughts, I can directly intervene in reality--but the machine also directly knows what I think. </p><p>In the last years of his life, Stephen Hawking experimented with a technology to communicate with the world--his brain was connected to a computer, so that his thoughts could choose words and form sentences, which were then relayed to a voice synthesizer to be spoken aloud. Fredric Jameson noted that, today, it is much more easy to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. This sarcastic insight is today becoming reality: it looks that, in some new form, capitalism will effectively survive the end, not of the world, but of humanity.</p><p>The Economist: Brexit and the rise of populist politicians seem to show that voters want to be protected from the harder edges of globalisation. So, back to Jameson's thought, is it still easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of the free-market consensus associated with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan?</p><p>Mr Zizek: As with fascism, I think that populism is simply a new way to imagine capitalism without its harder edges; a capitalism without its socially disruptive effects. Populism is one of today's two opiums of the people: one is the people, and the other is opium itself. Chemistry (in its scientific version) is becoming part of us: large aspects of our lives are characterised by the management of our emotions by drugs, from everyday use of sleeping pills and antidepressants to hard narcotics. We are not just controlled by impenetrable social powers, our very emotions are \"outsourced\" to chemical stimulation. What remains of the passionate public engagement in the West is mostly the populist hatred, and this brings us to the other second opium of the people, the people itself, the fuzzy populist dream destined to obfuscate our own antagonisms. </p><p>The Economist: In 1968, Jacques Lacan told student protesters in Paris that \"what you aspire to as revolutionaries is a new master. You will get one.\" Does the appeal of populists and so-called strong-men reflect a desire for authority that liberal democracy can't provide?</p><p>Mr Zizek: Yes, but in a way different from the one that Lacan had in mind in his pessimist reading of the 1968 turmoil. For Lacan, the consequence of 1968 was the decline of the old (directly authoritarian) figure of the master and the rise of a new master figure, than of the expert--what Lacan baptised the \"university discourse.\" Just think about how today economic measures are justified--not as an expression of political will and positive social vision but as a consequence of neutral knowledge: it has to be done, this is how markets work.</p><p>Just recall how the experts in Brussels acted in negotiations with Greece's Syriza government during the euro crisis in 2014: no debate, this has to be done. I think that today's populism reacts to the fact that experts are not really masters, that their expertise doesn't work--again, just remember how the 2008 financial meltdown caught the experts unprepared. Against the background of this fiasco, the traditional authoritarian master is making a comeback, even if it is a clown. Whatever Trump is, he is not an expert. </p><p>The Economist: Do you want a new master?</p><p>Mr Zizek: Surprisingly, YES, I do want it. But what kind of master? We usually see a master as someone who exerts domination, but there is another, more authentic, sense of a master. A true master is not an agent of discipline and prohibition, his message is not \"You cannot!\", nor \"You have to...!\", but a releasing \"You can!\"--what? Do the impossible, ie, what appears impossible within the coordinates of the existing constellation. And today, this means something very precise: you can think beyond capitalism and liberal democracy as the ultimate framework of our lives. </p><p>A master is a vanishing mediator who gives you back to yourself, who delivers you to the abyss of your freedom. When we listen to a true leader, we discover what we want (or, rather, what we \"always-already\" wanted without knowing it). A master is needed because we cannot accede to our freedom directly--for to gain this access, we have to be pushed from outside, since our \"natural state\" is one of inert hedonism; of what Alain Badiou called the \"human animal.\" </p><p>The underlying paradox here is that the more we live as \"free individuals with no master,\" the more we are effectively non-free, caught within the existing frame of possibilities. We have to be pushed or disturbed into freedom by a master.</p><p>The Economist: You have argued for the \"occupation\" of the digital grid, but how can ordinary people hold big tech firms to account if only a tiny fraction of us are capable of comprehending an algorithm?</p><p>Mr Zizek: True, we--the majority--don't understand the details of algorithms, but we can easily understand how we are controlled by the digital grid. Moreover, I don't think the experts themselves fully understand how the digital grid really works, plus those who exploit their knowledge also do not know the technical details. </p><p>Do you think that when Steve Bannon mobilised Cambridge Analytica, he understood the algorithmic details of its work? Or take ecology: to grasp global warming and the ozone hole, you need science which most of us don't understand, but we nonetheless can fight against the prospect of ecological catastrophe. </p><p>There are risks of manipulation here, of course, but we have to accept them. We have to abandon the na\u00efve faith in the spontaneous wisdom of everyday people as a guideline of our acts. That's the paradox of our era: our most ordinary daily lives are regulated by scientific knowledge, and the dangers of this (often invisible) regulation can be fought only by a different knowledge, not by New Age wisdoms and common sense.    </p><p>*      *      *</p><p>From \"Like a Thief in Broad Daylight: Power in the Era of Post-Humanity,\" by Slavoj Zizek. </p><p>In a hotel in Skopje, Macedonia, where I recently stayed, my companion inquired if smoking is permitted in our room, and the answer she got from the receptionist was unique: \"Of course not, it is prohibited by the law. But you have ashtrays in the room, so this is not a problem.\" The contradiction (between prohibition and permission) was openly assumed and thereby cancelled, treated as inexistent, i.e., the message was: \"It's prohibited, and here it is how you do it.\" When we entered the room, a further surprise awaited us: an ashtray with the sign of the prohibition to smoke...</p><p>Maybe, this incident provides the best metaphor for our ideological predicament today.  I remember a similar incident from my military service 40 years ago. One morning, the first class was on international military law, them among other rules, the officer mentioned that it is prohibited to shoot at parachuters while they are still in the air, i.e., before they touch ground. In a happy coincidence, our next class was about rifle shooting, and the same officer taught us how to target a parachuter in the air (how, while aiming at it, one should take into account the velocity of his decent and the direction and strength of the wind, etc.). When one of the soldiers asked the officer about the contradiction between this lesson and what we learned just an hour before (the prohibition to shoot at parachuters), the officer just snapped back with a cynical laughter: \"How can you be so stupid? Don't you understand how life works?\" What goes on today is that a dissonance is openly admitted and for that reason treated as irrelevant, like our example of the ashtray with the sign of prohibition of smoking. Recall the debates on torture - was the stance of the US authorities not something like: \"Torture is prohibited, and here is how you do a water-boarding.\"?</p><p>The paradox is thus that today, there is in some way less deception than in a more traditional functioning of ideology: nobody is really deceived. One has to avoid a crucial misunderstanding here: it is not that prior to our time we took the rules and prohibitions seriously while today we openly violate them. What changed are the rules which regulate appearances, i.e., what can appear in public space. Let's compare the sexual lives of two US presidents, Kennedy and Trump. As we know now, Kennedy had numerous affairs, but the press and TV ignored all this, while Trump's every (old and new) step is followed by the media - not to mention that Trump also speaks publicly in an obscene way that we cannot even imagine Kennedy doing it. The gap that separates the dignified public space from its obscene underside is now more and more transposed into public space, with ambiguous consequences: inconsistencies and violations of public rules and openly accepted or at least ignored, but, simultaneously, we are all becoming openly aware of these inconsistencies.</p><p>Excerpted from \"Like a Thief in Broad Daylight:  Power in the Era of Post-Humanity\".

Other states, including Florida, recently took similar steps that free up municipalities such as Tallahassee that want to provide the service. Utilities such as Florida Power &amp; Light are also considering BPL. </p><p>The federal government also has pledged its support for BPL as a way to ensure that high-speed Internet service reaches every corner of the country. </p><p>Suddenly, \"there's a lot of good momentum,\" said Scott Bruce, managing director of Current Communications Group, which two weeks ago got a major investment -- $100 million, according to published reports -- from Google, media giant Hearst Corp. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.Current manages one of only a few commercial deployments of BPL service in the nation, near Cincinnati. </p><p>The problem is that the new momentum might be too little, too late. BPL may never become more than a niche technology limited to rural areas that can't get Internet service over TV cables or DSL telephone lines. </p><p>The idea of plugging into the World Wide Web by simply plugging into a wall socket has been around nearly as long as those two dominant broadband tech- nologies. </p><p>With BPL, data travels over power lines from an Internet connection at a power plant to homes and offices. A customer simply plugs a computer into a wall socket or connects to a wireless transmitter mounted on a nearby power pole. </p><p>Just as significantly, BPL can give power companies unprecedented control over their power lines. With it, utilities can monitor lines for problems, read meters remotely and turn service on or off without dispatching employees. </p><p>\"Yes, you can provide consumers an alternative to cable and DSL, but more importantly, this is a major tool that can transform utilities and bring them into the 21st century,\" said Raymond Blair, vice president of BPL initiatives for IBM. </p><p>Last week, IBM announced it was partnering with CenterPoint Energy Inc. to explore BPL technology and test it in about 50 homes in Houston. </p><p>Atlanta-based utility Southern Co. has been considering BPL for several years. So far, the most intriguing application of the technology is for monitoring power lines and other equipment, said Leif Ericson, business development manager at Southern's telecom subsidiary. </p><p>\"We don't see ourselves as a broadband service provider or some sort of other ISP,\" Ericson said. \"Our real focus . . . has been on whether we might be able to overlay (BPL) to gain access to all sorts of intelligence\" about existing lines and equipment. </p><p>In all, about 40 utilities across the country have run or plan to run BPL trials. </p><p>Yet, with the exception of Current partner Cinergy Corp. in Ohio, no investor-owned utility has committed to selling the service yet. </p><p>Even at Cinergy, some are less than enthusiastic about the year-old experiment. </p><p>\"We didn't anticipate this was going to happen overnight,\" Cinergy spokeswoman Kathy Meinke said. \"We're continuing to move forward.\" </p><p>Neither Cinergy nor Current would disclose how many customers have signed up for the service. While Cinergy earlier said it would expand beyond Cincinnati and into neighboring Warren and Butler counties by next year, any expansion plans are still \"yet to be determined,\" Meinke said. </p><p>Partly what has kept more utilities from rolling out BPL is the cost. Although power lines that can carry broadband signals are already in place, it can cost $250 or more per household for equipment that gets the signals from a home to the power pole or underground line. </p><p>That's relatively cheap compared with cable and DSL equipment. But utilities are notoriously tight when it comes to spending on new technology. And the last time many of them strayed from their core business and tried to offer telephone voice service, they failed miserably. </p><p>Meanwhile, early BPL technology was slow and plagued with problems. Download speeds were only a little better than dial-up service, and radio operators complained the equipment caused interference. </p><p>Newer semiconductor technology has solved interference problems, industry officials claim. At the same time, BPL now offers both downloads and uploads at 3 megabits per second -- double the speed of DSL, and faster than cable at a comparable price. </p><p>But performance may have become a moot point because of utilities' lateness to the broadband business. </p><p>Today, with cable modem and DSL available to an estimated 90 percent of households, there really isn't much of a market left for utilities offering BPL, said Jim Penhune, an analyst with technology research company Strategy Analytics. </p><p>\"I just think the timing of it is wrong,\" Penhune said. \"Cable (and telephone) companies are so far ahead . . . it's a little hard for me to see how a third class of network is going to be viable.\" </p><p>BPL proponents disagree, of course. </p><p>The recent interest from the big tech companies shows that the technology still has plenty of promise, said Brett Kilbourne, director of regulatory services for the trade group United Power Line Council. Along with Google and IBM, Motorola in May announced it was developing BPL technology and said it was teaming up with a rural South Carolina utility to launch BPL broadband service. Last year, Mitsubishi Electric Power Products Inc. also announced it was exploring BPL technology. </p><p>At the same time, Kilbourne and other proponents say, there are still plenty of households -- 13 million by some counts -- that aren't able to get broadband access because cable and telecom companies don't offer it in their areas. </p><p>Also driving interest in BPL are recent court decisions that limit Internet companies' access to cable and phone lines. </p><p>Atlanta-based EarthLink Inc., for instance, has run several trials in North Carolina and elsewhere and is very encouraged, said EarthLink vice president Kevin Brand. </p><p>BPL's best shot at success may be in reaching rural households, said Jupiter Research analyst Joe Laszlo. </p><p>As a result, Laszlo predicts alternative broadband technologies including BPL, fixed wireless and satellite will triple their customers over the next five years, although they will still account for less than 3 percent of the broadband business. </p><p>Hilco Electric Cooperative north of Waco earlier this year launched a BPL pilot program that brought high-speed Internet service to its members for the first time. </p><p>Hilco general manager Gerald Lemons compared it to the introduction of electricity to rural areas in the 1930s by government-sponsored cooper- atives. </p><p>\"For us, it's the same principle as 60-plus years ago, when investor-owned utilities wouldn't run power to rural areas because it wasn't cost-effective,\" Lemons said. \"This is letting folks in rural areas have some of the same things that folks have in the suburbs and urban areas.\" </p><p>Lemons declined to say how many of the cooperative's 19,000 members have signed up for BPL service or how much they pay, citing confidentiality agreements with third-party Internet partners. </p><p>The biggest benefit for rural residents might be that BPL has finally lured other high-speed Internet providers to the area. </p><p>Shortly after Hilco began offering service in one rural neighborhood, Lemons said, telecom giant SBC Communications Inc. started offering DSL service there for the first time. </p><p>\"If you believe the objective is just to get these amenities to rural areas . . . we're already successful,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4GNP-YH10-TWK1-B2K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTIN-0501016594</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTIN2005</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147871</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1313\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Austin American Statesman</copyright><publicationName>Austin American-Statesman (Texas)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>July 17, 2005 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001U7O</classCode><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001XW2</classCode><className>SOUTHERN CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0001XBN</classCode><className>HEARST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC00021W3</classCode><className>CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002PWX</classCode><className>FLORIDA POWER &amp;

Other states, including Florida, recently took similar steps that free up municipalities such as Tallahassee that want to provide the service. Utilities such as Florida Power &amp; Light are also considering BPL. </p><p>The federal government also has pledged its support for BPL as a way to ensure that high-speed Internet service reaches every corner of the country. </p><p>Suddenly, \"there's a lot of good momentum,\" said Scott Bruce, managing director of Current Communications Group, which two weeks ago got a major investment -- $100 million, according to published reports -- from Google, media giant Hearst Corp. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.Current manages one of only a few commercial deployments of BPL service in the nation, near Cincinnati. </p><p>The problem is that the new momentum might be too little, too late. BPL may never become more than a niche technology limited to rural areas that can't get Internet service over TV cables or DSL telephone lines. </p><p>The idea of plugging into the World Wide Web by simply plugging into a wall socket has been around nearly as long as those two dominant broadband tech- nologies. </p><p>With BPL, data travels over power lines from an Internet connection at a power plant to homes and offices. A customer simply plugs a computer into a wall socket or connects to a wireless transmitter mounted on a nearby power pole. </p><p>Just as significantly, BPL can give power companies unprecedented control over their power lines. With it, utilities can monitor lines for problems, read meters remotely and turn service on or off without dispatching employees. </p><p>\"Yes, you can provide consumers an alternative to cable and DSL, but more importantly, this is a major tool that can transform utilities and bring them into the 21st century,\" said Raymond Blair, vice president of BPL initiatives for IBM. </p><p>Last week, IBM announced it was partnering with CenterPoint Energy Inc. to explore BPL technology and test it in about 50 homes in Houston. </p><p>Atlanta-based utility Southern Co. has been considering BPL for several years. So far, the most intriguing application of the technology is for monitoring power lines and other equipment, said Leif Ericson, business development manager at Southern's telecom subsidiary. </p><p>\"We don't see ourselves as a broadband service provider or some sort of other ISP,\" Ericson said. \"Our real focus . . . has been on whether we might be able to overlay (BPL) to gain access to all sorts of intelligence\" about existing lines and equipment. </p><p>In all, about 40 utilities across the country have run or plan to run BPL trials. </p><p>Yet, with the exception of Current partner Cinergy Corp. in Ohio, no investor-owned utility has committed to selling the service yet. </p><p>Even at Cinergy, some are less than enthusiastic about the year-old experiment. </p><p>\"We didn't anticipate this was going to happen overnight,\" Cinergy spokeswoman Kathy Meinke said. \"We're continuing to move forward.\" </p><p>Neither Cinergy nor Current would disclose how many customers have signed up for the service. While Cinergy earlier said it would expand beyond Cincinnati and into neighboring Warren and Butler counties by next year, any expansion plans are still \"yet to be determined,\" Meinke said. </p><p>Partly what has kept more utilities from rolling out BPL is the cost. Although power lines that can carry broadband signals are already in place, it can cost $250 or more per household for equipment that gets the signals from a home to the power pole or underground line. </p><p>That's relatively cheap compared with cable and DSL equipment. But utilities are notoriously tight when it comes to spending on new technology. And the last time many of them strayed from their core business and tried to offer telephone voice service, they failed miserably. </p><p>Meanwhile, early BPL technology was slow and plagued with problems. Download speeds were only a little better than dial-up service, and radio operators complained the equipment caused interference. </p><p>Newer semiconductor technology has solved interference problems, industry officials claim. At the same time, BPL now offers both downloads and uploads at 3 megabits per second -- double the speed of DSL, and faster than cable at a comparable price. </p><p>But performance may have become a moot point because of utilities' lateness to the broadband business. </p><p>Today, with cable modem and DSL available to an estimated 90 percent of households, there really isn't much of a market left for utilities offering BPL, said Jim Penhune, an analyst with technology research company Strategy Analytics. </p><p>\"I just think the timing of it is wrong,\" Penhune said. \"Cable (and telephone) companies are so far ahead . . . it's a little hard for me to see how a third class of network is going to be viable.\" </p><p>BPL proponents disagree, of course. </p><p>The recent interest from the big tech companies shows that the technology still has plenty of promise, said Brett Kilbourne, director of regulatory services for the trade group United Power Line Council. Along with Google and IBM, Motorola in May announced it was developing BPL technology and said it was teaming up with a rural South Carolina utility to launch BPL broadband service. Last year, Mitsubishi Electric Power Products Inc. also announced it was exploring BPL technology. </p><p>At the same time, Kilbourne and other proponents say, there are still plenty of households -- 13 million by some counts -- that aren't able to get broadband access because cable and telecom companies don't offer it in their areas. </p><p>Also driving interest in BPL are recent court decisions that limit Internet companies' access to cable and phone lines. </p><p>Atlanta-based EarthLink Inc., for instance, has run several trials in North Carolina and elsewhere and is very encouraged, said EarthLink vice president Kevin Brand. </p><p>BPL's best shot at success may be in reaching rural households, said Jupiter Research analyst Joe Laszlo. </p><p>As a result, Laszlo predicts alternative broadband technologies including BPL, fixed wireless and satellite will triple their customers over the next five years, although they will still account for less than 3 percent of the broadband business. </p><p>Hilco Electric Cooperative north of Waco earlier this year launched a BPL pilot program that brought high-speed Internet service to its members for the first time. </p><p>Hilco general manager Gerald Lemons compared it to the introduction of electricity to rural areas in the 1930s by government-sponsored cooper- atives. </p><p>\"For us, it's the same principle as 60-plus years ago, when investor-owned utilities wouldn't run power to rural areas because it wasn't cost-effective,\" Lemons said. \"This is letting folks in rural areas have some of the same things that folks have in the suburbs and urban areas.\" </p><p>Lemons declined to say how many of the cooperative's 19,000 members have signed up for BPL service or how much they pay, citing confidentiality agreements with third-party Internet partners. </p><p>The biggest benefit for rural residents might be that BPL has finally lured other high-speed Internet providers to the area. </p><p>Shortly after Hilco began offering service in one rural neighborhood, Lemons said, telecom giant SBC Communications Inc. started offering DSL service there for the first time. </p><p>\"If you believe the objective is just to get these amenities to rural areas . . . we're already successful,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4GNP-Y2G0-TWK1-B3BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTIN-0501016594</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTIN2005</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147871</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1313\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Austin American Statesman</copyright><publicationName>Austin American-Statesman (Texas)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>July 17, 2005 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001U7O</classCode><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001XW2</classCode><className>SOUTHERN CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0001XBN</classCode><className>HEARST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC00021W3</classCode><className>CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002PWX</classCode><className>FLORIDA POWER &amp;

The Helping Infrastructure Restore the Economy Act would effectively transform 10 states into D.C. by moving at least 90% of jobs from 10 executive departments out of Washington and into \u201ceconomically distressed regions\u201d across the country.</p><p><br/>The bill\u2019s sponsors, Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, would send the Agriculture and Education departments to their respective states. Eight other federal departments and most nondepartment agencies would also be dispersed throughout the land, often to places intended to suit their functions\u2014for example, the Transportation Department would be sent to Michigan to be near the auto industry.<br/>Imagine the clamoring this would ignite among the states for the dozens of agencies on the move. Within each state, every hamlet will vie to host at least a \u201cbranch,\u201d like the post offices that linger on in disuse in the internet age.<br/>The only understandable part of this plan is conservatives\u2019 visceral desire for revenge. People across the county can see the massive houses Washington bureaucrats and consultants occupy, walled off in single-party strongholds like Fairfax, Va. Mr. Hawley is right that \u201cAmericans\u2019 hard-earned tax dollars fund federal agencies that are mainly located in the D.C. bubble .\u00a0.\u00a0. too removed from the rest of America,\u201d and that most people \u201clack equal access to those jobs.\u201d<br/>But since when did Republicans accept the idea that the federal government ought to be a premier job creator? The GOP insisted for decades that many New Deal agencies and subsequent government bodies should never have been created in the first place, and that their red tape and interference is a dominant cause of economic inefficiency. Consider the department Mr. Hawley wants to bring home. The American Farm Bureau Federation reports that nearly 40% of U.S. farm income in 2019 will come from \u201ctrade aid, disaster assistance, the farm bill and insurance indemnities\u201d\u2014much of which is largess from the Agriculture Department that keeps farmers dependent and uncompetitive.<br/>One might expect such a plan from Democrats, who are quick to name federal spending as the solution to every problem. Republicans are supposed to understand the unseen mechanics of redistribution, aware that taxpayer money paid to government employees in their states is taken from taxpayers nationwide, a drag on the economy of the entire country.<br/>It will be impossible to uproot or at least prune the bureaucracy once its seeds are spread to every state. And the new federal jobs in each state wouldn\u2019t likely go to locals. One main criterion for a relocation site is \u201ca low rate of education,\u201d so expect a stream of college-educated professionals to move to the South and Midwest to claim the positions.<br/>The HIRE Act pays lip service to the ideal of cutting government by directing the General Services Administration and Office of Management and Budget to ascertain whether each agency slated for relocation \u201cshould be abolished or merged with another Executive agency, rather than being relocated.\u201d But conservatives have been led up this road before. President Trump kicked off his presidency with an \u201cexecutive branch restructuring\u201d project to be overseen by the OMB. How many agencies did that eliminate? You know the answer.<br/>Republicans used to seethe when Democrats tried to move federal offices. In the early 1990s, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich fumed that Sen. Robert Byrd\u2019s campaign to transfer certain national intelligence facilities to West Virginia was a \u201cpure abuse of power.\u201d<br/>Now Mrs. Blackburn cheerily says in a statement: \u201cFederal jobs provide economic stability and encourage regional growth. When the FBI moved the Criminal Justice Information Services Center to Clarksburg, WV, the stable stream of revenue from those jobs boosted the local economy and helped it grow.\u201d<br/>Mr. Hawley\u2019s role in this campaign is particularly vexing. He has become a famous critic of Big Tech, but the federal bureaucracy is already vastly larger and more intrusive than the software companies he disparages and targets through legislation.<br/>Would legislators from the \u201clucky\u201d chosen states ever have the gumption to slash funding from agencies that employ thousands of their constituents and pay them generously? The HIRE Act would tie Middle America inextricably to big progressive government, remaking America in Washington\u2019s image. The bill\u2019s supposed decentralization would be anything but.<br/>Americans need policy makers to discipline the arrogance that prevails inside the Beltway, not spread it. A better bill to restructure the government would freeze hiring for federal jobs. Such an effort would cut agencies\u2019 spending and streamline their functions.<br/>In contrast, the HIRE Act would create \u201cSwamp 2.0\u201d: just as deep and many times as wide.<br/>Originally published at The Wall Street Journal.<br/>Image:\u00a0Experts:\u00a0Clyde Wayne CrewsDate:\u00a0Tuesday, December 3, 2019Source:\u00a0The Wall Street JournalIssues:\u00a0Regulatory ReformSearch Keywords:\u00a0regulationsDCSwampMedia appearance type:\u00a0Op-Eds and ArticlesTeaser:\u00a0Progressives dream of making the District of Columbia into a state, but now a pair of Republican senators have the same vision reflected through a funhouse mirror.

Recent statements by Trump and his digital campaign director Brad Parscale - such as \"Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican-conservative voices,\" and \"conservatives have been shut out of YouTube, videos are devalued within the algorithm based on some of the view within it,\" or \"Google is a threat to the republic\" - demonstrate their frustration from losing a major weapon in their campaign arsenal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is there a reason for such an outcry? In the 2016 campaign, social media platforms and especially Facebook were used to micro-target political ads in sophisticated ways never seen before. Psycho-graphic profiling - the disputed method used by Cambridge Analytica - matched specified ads with personal identities and behavioral traits. Although it is very hard to make a direct link between a person who saw a certain ad and his or her vote, the 2016 Trump campaign demonstrated highly impressive data collection and segmented targeting capacities.</p><p>The two years that have since passed were not boring for social media giants. The once-immune super-companies had to stand against criticism and backlash from their users, advertisers and above of all, governments. The Cambridge Analytica case opened the door for inquiry into Russian interference in the elections, as well as for ongoing mishandling of \"fake news\" and hate speech on their platforms.</p><p>Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were summoned to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Mark Zuckerberg himself earned the privilege of answering tough questions from 44 senators. Europe went one step further and introduced the General Data Protection Regulation in May, which stands as the most assertive regulatory move against big tech companies so far. Finally, the market has spoken. Facebook lost about $120 billion when its stock plunged 20% following its financial reports.</p><p>Then things started to change. Twitter announced that it had cleaned its platform from millions of fake accounts and bots, while Facebook announced that it caught an attempt to disrupt mid-term elections. The change of mindsets and perhaps of policies is vivid in Facebook's legal adviser Colin Stretch's recent memo: \"We need to build a user experience that conveys honesty and respect... we need to intentionally not collect data where possible, and to keep it only as long as we are using it to serve people... we need to be willing to pick sides when there are clear moral or humanitarian issues.\"</p><p>THE PRESSURE that governments applied to tech giants hit like a boomerang. The platforms learned about the limitations of power the hard way. As a first defensive measure, they became much more careful with political content. Publishing political ads on Facebook takes now a few days and not a few minutes as before. Bots and fake accounts have been removed, at least some of which were promoting conservative content. Such changes impact both liberals and conservatives, so why are the complaints coming only form conservatives? Why is social media so important for them?</p><p>The answer could be found in the almost perfect match between social media's algorithmic design and the conservative digital campaign strategy. Content published on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube competes for user time online. Among endless pieces of information presented on our screens, a post or a video that will get more attention must be short, simple and emotional. In the political context that correlates exactly with the current conservative campaign strategy of presenting reality in one dimension. Messages of winner vs. loser, good vs. bad and us vs. them usually emphasize fear or hate of the other. Those posts and messages get more attention, more \"likes\" and comments and get pushed up in the feed by the algorithm.</p><p>The starting point for liberal agendas and campaigning is much more difficult. Liberals who wish to explain the complex nature of issues such as immigration, healthcare or North Korean negotiations, will find it almost impossible to do so in a 280-character tweet or a picture. Logic-based arguments for social-political issues will not be as powerful as a picture that invokes fear and hate because our brains are evolutionary programmed to be more attuned to threats than to opportunities. Consequently, the conservative social media campaign strategy is in perfect alignment with social media companies' business model and the human brain.</p><p>No wonder then that Trump and Parscale are frustrated. Any changes to the algorithms might significantly harm their social media campaign strategy. Perhaps the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google realized the danger their platforms serve for the democratic process and are now working to fix it. Tech giants took a bigger step inside the political game.</p><p>The writer is the founder of Conntix.

Recent statements by Trump and his digital campaign director Brad Parscale \u2013 such as \"Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican-conservative voices,\" and \"conservatives have been shut out of YouTube, videos are devalued within the algorithm based on some of the view within it,\" or \"Google is a threat to the republic\" \u2013 demonstrate their frustration from losing a major weapon in their campaign arsenal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is there a reason for such an outcry? In the 2016 campaign, social media platforms and especially Facebook were used to micro-target political ads in sophisticated ways never seen before. Psycho-graphic profiling \u2013 the disputed method used by Cambridge Analytica \u2013 matched specified ads with personal identities and behavioral traits. Although it is very hard to make a direct link between a person who saw a certain ad and his or her vote, the 2016 Trump campaign demonstrated highly impressive data collection and segmented targeting capacities.</p><p>The two years that have since passed were not boring for social media giants. The once-immune super-companies had to stand against criticism and backlash from their users, advertisers and above of all, governments. The Cambridge Analytica case opened the door for inquiry into Russian interference in the elections, as well as for ongoing mishandling of \"fake news\" and hate speech on their platforms.</p><p>Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were summoned to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Mark Zuckerberg himself earned the privilege of answering tough questions from 44 senators. Europe went one step further and introduced the General Data Protection Regulation in May, which stands as the most assertive regulatory move against big tech companies so far. Finally, the market has spoken. Facebook lost about $120 billion when its stock plunged 20% following its financial reports.</p><p>Then things started to change. Twitter announced that it had cleaned its platform from millions of fake accounts and bots, while Facebook announced that it caught an attempt to disrupt mid-term elections. The change of mindsets and perhaps of policies is vivid in Facebook's legal adviser Colin Stretch's recent memo: \"We need to build a user experience that conveys honesty and respect... we need to intentionally not collect data where possible, and to keep it only as long as we are using it to serve people... we need to be willing to pick sides when there are clear moral or humanitarian issues.\"</p><p>THE PRESSURE that governments applied to tech giants hit like a boomerang. The platforms learned about the limitations of power the hard way. As a first defensive measure, they became much more careful with political content. Publishing political ads on Facebook takes now a few days and not a few minutes as before. Bots and fake accounts have been removed, at least some of which were promoting conservative content. Such changes impact both liberals and conservatives, so why are the complaints coming only form conservatives? Why is social media so important for them?</p><p>The answer could be found in the almost perfect match between social media's algorithmic design and the conservative digital campaign strategy. Content published on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube competes for user time online. Among endless pieces of information presented on our screens, a post or a video that will get more attention must be short, simple and emotional. In the political context that correlates exactly with the current conservative campaign strategy of presenting reality in one dimension. Messages of winner vs. loser, good vs. bad and us vs. them usually emphasize fear or hate of the other. Those posts and messages get more attention, more \"likes\" and comments and get pushed up in the feed by the algorithm.</p><p>The starting point for liberal agendas and campaigning is much more difficult. Liberals who wish to explain the complex nature of issues such as immigration, healthcare or North Korean negotiations, will find it almost impossible to do so in a 280-character tweet or a picture. Logic-based arguments for social-political issues will not be as powerful as a picture that invokes fear and hate because our brains are evolutionary programmed to be more attuned to threats than to opportunities. Consequently, the conservative social media campaign strategy is in perfect alignment with social media companies' business model and the human brain.</p><p>No wonder then that Trump and Parscale are frustrated. Any changes to the algorithms might significantly harm their social media campaign strategy. Perhaps the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google realized the danger their platforms serve for the democratic process and are now working to fix it. Tech giants took a bigger step inside the political game.</p><p>The writer is the founder of Conntix.

From the Facebook debacle with Cambridge Analytica to the revelations that smart speaker companies had used human reviewers to listen to recordings, there have been too many incidents in recent months that reinforce the idea that trusting your data to private companies is not the best idea we've ever had. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not surprising that people are becoming more aware of the implications of data security - and that companies are starting to see the benefits of making privacy a feature to shout about rather than something to tolerate. </p><p>Think about the phone in your pocket. It is no longer a simple means of making and receiving calls. It tracks your location, monitors your activity, looks after your financial information. We have apps that replace loyalty cards, giving up valuable data on our shopping habits. Our credit and debit cards live in mobile wallets, ready for us to pay for goods and services with contactless technology. Your phone knows who you contact most often, what you spent your last few euro on and the places you visit most frequently. </p><p>Our devices are becoming ever more intertwined with our daily lives. Activity trackers monitor your health, sharing information with healthcare professionals and in some cases insurance companies. </p><p>Smart speakers, for example, have become an increasingly common sight in homes, listening for the \"wake word\" that signals it is time to spring into action. </p><p>From there, your device can control your connected home security system.</p><p>The problem is not only the amount of control the speakers have over your home, but also what they hear. </p><p>Amazon was the first to come to the public attention, when it was reported that the company sent snippets of voice commands to human reviewers to help improve the accuracy of the service. Although people may have been aware that their recordings would be used to help improve the accuracy of the service, there were probably very few who realised the extent of the human involvement. Amazon said it only used \"an extremely small sample\" of Alexa voice recordings to improve the customer experience.</p><p>Amazon now allows people to opt out, but it took some public outcry before the tech company changed its course. </p><p>It seemed no company was immune. Google recently introduced a new policy that will see users of Google Assistant opt in if they want to have their voice recorded or reviewed by humans through its Voice &amp; Audio Activity (VAA) programme. </p><p>In August, Apple apologised for allowing contractors to listen to voice recordings from Siri users, as part of an evaluation process for its digital assistant. </p><p>In a report by the Guardian, former graders claimed accidental activations were regularly sent for review. Among the clips were recordings of confidential information, illegal acts, and even sexual activity. </p><p>Following a review, Apple stopped the programme, and said it would restart it later in the year as an opt-in initiative with Apple employees instead of contractors. Recruitment for those positions began last month. </p><p>\"As a result of our review, we realise we have not been fully living up to our high ideals, and for that we apologise,\" the company said at the time. </p><p>It was a rare misstep for Apple, which has in recent years pushed the idea that privacy should be at the heart of all its products. From its mapping software to its mobile payments, the company keeps customer data close to its chest. </p><h> Vulnerabilities For security consultant Brian Honan, Apple is one of the top companies when its comes to data privacy. It is chiefly because it refuses to share such data, plus its stance on building in vulnerabilities to its software to satisfy law enforcement requests. </h><p>The company has made it central to its strategy. When it unveiled its latest News+ and TV+ apps in March, Tim Cook stressed that advertising would not be allowed on the new services, and that Apple would not be passing data to third parties to allow them to sell its subscribers more products. </p><p>In an op-ed for Time magazine earlier this year, Cook once again laid out his views. He described 2019 as the time to stand up for the right to privacy, and called for US congress to pass federal privacy legislation that minimises personal data and gives consumers the right to know what data is being collected and why, the right to access that data and the right to data security. </p><p>\"Consumers shouldn't have to tolerate another year of companies irresponsibly amassing huge user profiles, data breaches that seem out of control and the vanishing ability to control our own digital lives,\" he wrote. \"This problem is solvable - it isn't too big, too challenging or too late. Innovation, breakthrough ideas and great features can go hand-in-hand with user privacy - and they must. Realising technology's potential depends on it.\"</p><p>Apple, for its part, says privacy is a \"fundamental human right\" and is keen to point out that users of its products keep ownership and control over their data. </p><p>When the company announced that it would add to its series of health studies with research on hearing, women's health, mobility and heart health, it immediately reassured customers that it would only be with their express permission. </p><p>\"You decide what data you want to share and with whom. Apple cannot access any information that directly identifies you,\" Apple's VP of health Sumbul Desai said. </p><p>Cook's op-ed is not the first time Apple has made a pitch as a privacy protector. The company went up against federal investigators in the US in 2015 when it refused to build a vulnerability into its mobile software so the FBI could unlock a phone used by Sayed Farook, one of the suspects in the San Bernadino shooting. </p><p>Its reasoning was sound: building software that would allow authorities to bypass its security would put millions of users at risk, and the chance of it getting into the wild was one that Apple wasn't willing to take. If authorities could get around the security protections, there was nothing to stop bad actors from doing likewise. </p><p>Another company that makes it to the top of Honan's list for its commitment to privacy and security is Microsoft. Despite its Skype troubles (the service was touted as a machine learning language translator that could work in real time, but it later emerged that human contractors were listening to some conversations), Microsoft has built up some goodwill from its opposition to the US government's attempt to force it to turn over data from a server located in Ireland. The case began in 2013 when Microsoft opposed an order from the authorities to turn over the email, and subsequently appealed the verdict ordering it to comply with US legislation. </p><p>However, the case was later abandoned when, ahead of an appeal in the Supreme Court, Congress passed the Cloud (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data), which resolved concerns from the government and Microsoft. </p><p>Microsoft has also won some praise for its approach to its Windows 10 software, which, while not perfect, is more secure than other versions of the software the company has released. </p><p>There is a difference, however, between security and privacy, Honan points out. </p><p>\"You can have very secure windows in your bathroom, but if you don't have curtains or frosting on the glass, there's not very much privacy,\" he said. \"Likewise, if the window is left open, it's not very secure. </p><p>\"They're very closely related, they have to work together to protect people's data,\" said Honan. \"Don't mistake one for for the other.\" </p><p>One thing that needs to be taken into account is the role that the authorities have played in forcing the privacy agenda. While we may be sick of hearing the data protection excuse when trying to deal with companies on a daily basis, the introduction of GDPR last year has certainly had an impact. </p><p>\"GDPR has been a very positive move in the protection of individuals' privacy rights,\" said Honan. \"People are more aware of their individual rights.\" </p><p>However, there is still a long way to go, with May 25th, 2018 only the beginning rather than D-Day for data protection. Specifically, the implementation of the new regulations leave much to be desired, with stories of visitor books and waste paper bins being removed from public buildings under the guise of GDPR. </p><p>\"We still see a lot of bad practice regarding GDPR. It demonstrates they don't know what GDPR is about,\" said Honan. </p><h> Opportunities The focus on data privacy has helped create new opportunities for irish companies, too. Start-up Evervault, which was founded by 19-year-old Shane Curran, has just raised $3.2 million from tech investor Sequoia. The company is aiming to turn privacy into a product, with a cloud-based secure processing product aimed at developers that allows them to bake it in to their services without developers having to change how they build their software. </h><p>\"Our outlook is retooling the developers and the creators of the next couple of decades to basically embed data privacy from day one. As a company, we're basically working to make data privacy simple and accessible for all,\" Curran said. </p><p>The company is planning to expand in Ireland and get its product built using the money it raised from Sequoia and other investors such as Kleiner Perkins and Frontline. It has the potential, its founder thinks, to make a significant impact. </p><p>In the meantime, companies that have found themselves in the spotlight over data privacy, such as Facebook, are taking steps to rehabilitate their reputations. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to introduce end-to-end encryption in both Messenger and Instagram messages, making them more secure and keeping private messages away from prying eyes. </p><p>It's ironic that just as companies are realising the value of privacy to their customers, the authorities may be taking steps to weaken the most effective tool: encryption. The US, UK and Australia have called on Facebook to abandon the plan, citing the ability to fight back against criminals, terrorists and child abusers . </p><p>In an op-ed published by the Guardian, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden criticised the push against encryption and said cutting the governments off from Facebook's \"convenient trove\" of private lives would force government surveillance to become \"more targeted and methodical\".</p><p>\"By limiting the amount of personal records and intensely private communications held by companies, governments are returning to classic methods of investigation that are both effective and rights-respecting, in lieu of total surveillance,\" he said. \"In this outcome we remain not only safe, but free.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4060779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBR-HSM1-DYS1-01D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 24, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We can go back a few decades and look to Intel's development of the integrated circuit, for instance, or Apple's re\u00adimagining of the personal computer. More recent are planet-spanning websites, such as Facebook; search engines that resemble magic mirrors, such as Google's; and bazaars without end, such as  Amazon's. Many of us over 35 see this as a mixed blessing, of course: Access to wondrous technological tools has also brought us too much email, too many distractions and too much vulnerability - hackings, trollings, stalkings and worse. But what if the trade-offs are much larger than we realized? In the midst of our digital lives, Franklin Foer argues, doesn't it seem possible that Silicon Valley's darkest, stealthiest triumph has been to merge personal technologies that improve our efficiency with personal technologies that alter our humanity? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On a basic level, Foer's book aims to expose the dangers that four technology giants - Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon - pose to our culture and careers. In their methods of consumer observation and data gathering, and in their intention to replace human decision-making with merciless algorithms, these companies, Foer says, \"are shredding the principles that protect individuality.\"  </p><p>It's even worse than that, actually. Bent on dominating our markets as well as the world, the four corporations have lulled us into a sense of pliant dependency as they influence our thinking and activities. Far more powerful than the elite \"gatekeeping\" institutions of the past - the major television networks, for example, or the leading newspapers - this fearsome four, as Foer characterizes them, are the new arbiters of media, economy, politics and the arts.  By making their services cheap and indispensable, and by tail\u00adoring their complex algorithms to our data profiles, they can gently push us toward products they want us to buy or, say, YouTube videos they want us to watch. Yet the methods by which we get such recommendations - for news, consumer goods, movies, music, friends and the like - remain opaque.  Facebook's acceptance of thousands of Russian ads during the recent election may be a case in point. As Foer reminds us, through an algorithmic dispersal of misinformation, the social-media giant possibly helped elect to the presidency of the United States a frequently bankrupt real estate developer without any political experience whatsoever.</p><p> The heart of the problem, as Foer sees it, \"is that when we outsource thinking to machines, we are really outsourcing thinking to the organizations that run the machines.\"  It's an important distinction. Foer isn't an anti-tech\u00adnology zealot; he cops to being a Twitter addict and an enthusiastic user of screens and smartphones, even as he admits that his favorite indulgence is reading a book in his bathtub at home. What he most wants us to see, though, is how the companies that dominate the world's technology ecosystem have assumed the roles of monopolists, even if by an economist's definition they more closely resemble oligopolies, which is to say they are immensely powerful within certain markets (Web search, for instance, or social media) where there is limited competition. </p><p>I don't think he's exaggerating the point. As the investors Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen make clear, in the tech business, monopoly is not a forbidden zone but a desired destination. And as Foer notes, Andreessen has even argued that it may be the natural order of things - that while normal markets might have a Coke and a Pepsi competing against each other, \"in technology markets in the long run you tend to only have one.\" </p><p>Monopolies or quasi-monopolies that seem to be exploiting consumers - Western Electric, AT&amp;T, IBM, Microsoft - have of course long been targets for government scrutiny. But Foer thinks advanced technologies may be creating a more dangerous situation than what we've experienced in the past. The tech companies' wealth, market share, ingenuity and growing power on Capitol Hill make them increasingly formidable. As Foer frequently points out, \"We have begun to outsource our intellectual work to companies that suggest what we should learn, the topics we should consider.\"  But by carving out for themselves immense networks of influence and intelligence, these companies, he argues, have also developed what may prove to be unassailable advantages. They know our preferences better than their upstart competitors ever could, so the more they win, the more they win. And the longer this goes on, Foer fears, the worse it will get. </p><p>The first half of Foer's book is a takedown of what he terms the \"sham populism\" of the big tech companies. While he often seems less critical of Apple, he is scathing on the ambitions of Google's Larry Page, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos. About halfway through his book, though, Foer moves his argument in a more personal direction - toward his experiences as an editor at the New Republic magazine, where he was vanquished by a data-driven owner who bought the magazine with wealth gained from his Facebook stock. Foer's overly sentimental attachment to TNR narrows the shock-and-awe attack he began waging at his book's start. But it does allow him to illustrate the difficulties of trying to run a struggling cultural institution in the digital age, and it gives him insight into how the Web environment created by the technology behemoths exerts pressure on magazines and newspapers to make knowledge free online, often with diminishing returns to the content producers. </p><p>Also, it leads him eventually - and persuasively, I thought - toward some prescriptions for lessening the dangers he perceives. For one thing, he asserts that we need to permanently reject the notion that knowledge should be free and that digital media shouldn't charge users. For another, we need the hand of government to intervene in a variety of novel ways. One place to start would be to give citizens a measure of control over information that technology companies collect. \"What we need,\" Foer writes, \"is a Data Protection Authority to protect privacy as the government protects the environment.\" He posits that this idea would let Americans purge their data that sits on company servers while also having the choice to opt out of surveillance. </p><p>By the end, one can't help but see \"World Without Mind\" as a polemic. And it happens to come in the wake of other powerful technology critiques - by Jaron Lanier and Nicholas Carr, for instance, who covered related ground in their own superb books. But Foer's writing is deft enough to make this a polemic in the best sense of the word, which is to say a relentless intellectual argument, executed in the tradition of George Orwell and Christopher Hitchens, which often eschews nuance in favor of wit and aggression. To be sure, he pens at least a few dubious, attention-grabbing sentences of caricature and fear-mongering. (For instance, he warns us that Google intends \"to impose its values and theological convictions on the world.\") And I would presume that Foer does not actually think he, or anyone else, can stop the march of technological progress, even if he sometimes comes off that way. His essential point seems that at the very least we should pause and consider acting, on both a public and a personal level, before we find that we've lost more of what makes us human - our individuality, agency and spontaneity - than we ever bargained for. And before we discover that the creative industries that support our culture have been so eroded by lower wages and machine learning that they are in danger of infrastructural collapse.</p><p>We might ask if this is an unwinnable battle. We love technology; we need technology. And in an era when regulation has increasingly fallen out of favor, the likelihood in the near future of a tight yoking of big tech (or a wholesale revamping of our government's \u00adanti-trust policies) seems unlikely. But I don't think it's unreasonable to believe, judging by the growth trajectory and ravenous appetites of the tech giants, that their day of reckoning will eventually come, just as it came for monopolies such as  Western Union and AT&amp;T. </p><p>Until then, Foer suggests that a number of refusenik decisions - reading a book on paper, say, rather than in an electronic format, which allows for the collection of information on our reading habits - are a good place to draw the line. Now, isn't that silly and small bore? At first I thought so, but then his modest argument struck me as having both symbolic and practical import. It's a starter kit for thinking deeper. Even if innovations in personal technology can't be stopped, their true value should always be questioned. And embracing some technologies while rejecting others is not an instance of hypocrisy. As Foer reminds us, the stakes are high, the marketing pitch is deafening, and saying no to big tech - at least sometimes - is an increasingly crucial matter of personal choice and civic responsibility. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-2f4bb656aab711e7850e2bdd1236be5d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PN4-5C31-JB4M-V2W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1528\"/><timeReceived>6:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 6, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

This British artificial intelligence start-up that learnt to play video and board games - like chess - better than humans was gobbled up by Google in 2014.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The entrepreneurial sellers received about $600 million for the innovative artificial intelligence firm - so far, so good. But it's what happened afterward that concerns Rogoff. DeepMind went quiet, and this lack of subsequent activity from promising young tech players after acquisition has become a pattern.</p><p>The economist in Rogoff sees these type of transactions as problematic for the modern global digital economy.</p><p>Rogoff believes big technology platform companies, such as Facebook and Google, are suppressing innovation and competition by acquiring competitive threats with \"blinding\" amounts of money paid to founding inventors.</p><p>\"You're being offered all this money and the nature of the negotiations are like 'if you don't sell to us we'll steal it',\" Rogoff <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/brand/business-summit/tech-giants-buy-startups-to-kill-competition-kenneth-rogoff-tells-summit-20180307-h0x4mn\">told The Australian Financial Review Business Summit</url> in Sydney this week.</p><p>\"Once the big tech company buys something, it's dead - they're looking to kill it.\"</p><p>Rogoff sees this as the big anti-trust or competition issue for regulators in the digital age.</p><p>He points to other examples, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971\">the $US2 billion sale of virtual reality company Oculus to Facebook</url> in 2014.</p><p>\"The reason that Oculus was so valuable was that it had designed an alternative operating system.

It overturns the conventional wisdom that customer data was proprietary and a source of competitive advantage.</p><p>ANZ's group executive for digital banking Maile Carnegie says competition laws \"are pretty antiquated in terms of the globalisation of business, but also the speed of innovation\".</p><p>But the former Google executive worries that opening up bank customer data to bit tech companies may deliver a win to Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"As governments look to regulate they are potentially going to regulate in a way that is going to be advantageous to the existing platform players,\" she told the Financial Review Summit this week.</p><p>\"They are going to do it because they want to open up competition and to stimulate startups, which is good, but if you look at the open economy and open data platform in Australia, if we are not careful and there aren't reciprocal data sharing rights you are basically going to strengthen the platform providers more than the startups.\"</p><p>It seems that, if data really is the new gold, every business wants to get their hands on it and circumvent competitors attaining access.</p><p>Key decisions on data, the power of big tech and competition policy will be critical to the performance of individual firms and the broader economy.</p><p>For Australia, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/brand/business-summit/transcript-of-rba-governor-philip-lowes-speech-to-afr-business-summit-20180307-h0x5ic\">Reserve Bank governor Phil Lowe said this week</url> that \"innovation, creativity and ingenuity\" will determine the country's future economic fortunes against the rest of the world.</p><p>\"A business culture that highly values innovation and competition and that is not afraid of taking risk will surely help in creating this positive environment,\" Lowe said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029475840</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTX-F5K1-DY19-C1FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1172\"/><timeReceived>06:57 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Bona[1]is the CEO of and Attorney at BonaLaw PC as well as a writer atThe Antitrust Attorney Blog[2]. Steven Levitsky[3]is also an Attorney at BonaLaw PC and a writer at The Antitrust Attorney Blog.[4] One year ago, Amazon acquired Whole Foods in a $13.7 billion deal[5]. At the time, David Balto, a disciple of current antitrust orthodoxy, wrote[6]: Those who are saying the Amazon-Whole Foods merger is a competition problem are leading us into the jungle without a compass and no clear objective. Antitrust law should stick to protecting consumers and let the free market work. The FTC quickly cleared 'Project Athena' and issued a very short press release[7] saying, 'The FTC conducted an investigation of this proposed acquisition to determine whether it substantially lessened competition under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, or constituted an unfair method of competition under Section 5 of the FTC Act. Based on our investigation we have decided not to pursue this matter further.' </p><p>In fact, there was a lot to love for consumers from this merger[8] over the last year: Amazon leveraged the Whole Foods stores to provide pick up and return centers for Amazon customers. Prices dropped. There are competitive alternatives. Those are, indeed, tangible consumer benefits. That's great, of course, and\u2014at least in the short run\u2014shows that the FTC reached the right conclusion in letting the merger go forward.  But, still, something feels different here. Uncomfortable even. Like when the sky is just too still before the storm hits. At least one of the authors of this article leans strongly libertarian and even feels worry. But let's pause from that feeling for a moment and return to antitrust law. The federal antitrust laws are an effective regulatory mechanism\u2014enforced through both agencies and courts\u2014when pure competition issues are involved. There is, of course, the periodic debate about what consumer welfare should mean, but for the most part antitrust law is effective in keeping the markets open for competition. And, of course, the US Supreme Court[9] famously explained in National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States (1978)[10] that 'The heart of our national economy long as been faith in the value of competition.'[11] But when it comes to mega-mergers and the related aggregation of power by some of today's big tech companies, are there limits to the effectiveness of current federal antitrust law to protect long-term consumer welfare? Antitrust law, of course, focuses on specifically defined, often narrow, product and geographic markets. And mega-mergers and tech company power may not necessarily threaten to lessen competition in a single market\u2014the Amazon-Whole Foods merger certainly didn't. But they do something much more pernicious: they aggregate data about us; they consolidate economic power across different markets; they acquire power through control of jobs, attention, and social and political communication; and they have the ability to harm local businesses (which, of course, was a larger concern of old-timey antitrust law, before the Chicago school made its appearance). George Orwell's 1984[12] never really materialized in terms of British government power (although Orwell may have believed that the British government had already acquired excess power by 1948). But today, Amazon, or Google, or Netflix, or Facebook, or Twitter are on aggregation cycles that give them the power (metaphorically, or possibly even literally) to listen in on our lives. For example, on August 23, 2018, there was a news report[13] that read: Representatives from a host of the biggest US tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, have scheduled a private meeting for Friday to share their tactics in preparation for the 2018 midterm elections. The same report indicated that nine of those same companies had already met in May 2018. Naturally, these companies claim they discuss only cybersecurity issues. But what do we do about these same social media companies that impose censorship on messages or information they don't like. It's great to say there are alternatives, but in fact, there aren't. Because of the power of network effects, many people rely on these primary social media networks for their information, and that network has essentially replaced the old town square or the newspaper as a source of information for a discussion forum. The government would not dare to silence debate the way these private companies have done. Size has economies of scale and efficiency, but it lacks the unconnected diversity of ideas, approaches, and testing that serve as the foundation for organic systems like a free-market economy. You replace a bottom-up system with a top-down system controlled by certain corporate powers, who use network effects to take over one aspect of our lives after another. This is where it starts to get confusing because those that typically push for free markets are confronted with a situation where worshipping efficiency could ultimately create homogeneous behemoths that can destroy any would-be competitors like an annoying gnat on a late summer night. In another article, one of us worried[14] about similar problems from speech filters inherent in these large networks controlling so many aspects of our lives. This is not healthy. It is not desirable. But it is probably not a violation of the antitrust laws. Let's return to the Amazon-Whole Foods merger. Yes, there are pro-competitive aspects to it. Now let's look at the other side. As one element, Amazon-Whole Foods now allows Amazon to collect data about individual consumers' food-buying habits. You might say that every grocery store with a loyalty card collects the same information. But Amazon already knows what books you read (and how often you read them), what movies you watch, and what brands of deodorant you buy. Depending on how accurate rumors[15] are, Amazon may also enter the pharmaceutical market, and if it does, it will know what medicines you take and how sick you are. Do most Americans welcome this type of invasive knowledge? No one, including antitrust enforcers, seems to have asked them. Amazon offers Prime discounts to Whole Food customers and offers free delivery for Prime members. Those are certainly consumer benefits. But with those comes a cost, which may or may not be significant. By bundling its products with collective discounts, Amazon makes it more attractive for shoppers to shift their buying practices from local stores to the internet giant. Will this eventually mean that local stores will become more inefficient, based on lower volume, and will eventually close? Do most Americans care about the potential loss of local supermarkets and specialty grocers? No one, including antitrust enforcers, seems to have asked them. What about small business providers, including, specifically, small organic providers? Whole Foods was a launching pad for many local organic companies and these relationships with small organic providers were negotiated locally by in-store personnel. That appears to have changed with Amazon's acquisition. It now appears from news reports[16] that Amazon will become a 'cost-efficient, national retainer.' That's great from an antitrust-oriented 'efficiency' perspective. We recall an article by William Kovacik and Carl Shapiro, 'Antitrust Policy: A Century of Economic and Legal Thinking,' in Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 14, No. 1 (2000), p. 43, at 51, that speaks disparagingly of Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294 (1962)[17], because 'The Court also held that non-efficiency goals, such as preserving small firms, were relevant to applying the statute.' On the other hand, do most Americans place some value on promoting local, community-based, organic food production or 'small firms' in general? No one, including antitrust enforcers, seems to have asked them. Does it matter to our health whether we eat whole unprocessed locally grown food or food that has entered a national distribution chain biased toward processing for the sake of surviving the chain? We are learning more and more that it does. But the antitrust enforcers don't ask this question. Perhaps the antitrust laws are inadequate to meet the social challenges of today's mega-mergers and tech company aggregation? People unquestionably like the convenience of Amazon and value the many positive benefits it brings them, including, we presume, the potential for discounted trips to the Moon for Prime members. But will they be as happy when Amazon turns into Big Brother and becomes one of the few oligarchical providers of every product they want, tying together masses of data and analytics about you personally that no American government has ever succeeded in collecting? The real question is how long will we have to listen to the litany that 'the antitrust laws are flexible enough to cover every situation.' We doubt that anyone in this country thinks that it is healthy to end up with extended mega-mergers whose business activities are controlled by one set of reins (like the Copperweld team of horses), that cover multiple parts of our lives, that collect and use big data that profiles our personal and medical choices, that can flick local business into oblivion, and that can destroy diversity of ideas (social, political, and business). Maybe the mantra, 'Big is Bad,' is not right. But 'Gargantuan is Bad' might be right. What can the antitrust laws do to prevent that? The answer is nothing, because each creeping aggregation may meet antitrust standards\u2014while it subverts the organic ground-up competition and diversity of ideas that we treasure. To sum up, yes, the Amazon-Whole Foods merger may have been totally innocuous from a strict 'lessening of competition' analysis. But the potential for what it (and similar mega-mergers and big tech aggregation) produces is a variety of lurking menaces progressively advancing on our society. There is only one law that protects Americans against bad mergers and that is the Clayton Act. But the Clayton Act doesn't effectively focus on the threats we just discussed. Are we too reliant on antitrust law to solve these problems or should we change antitrust to address them? Do we trust other parts of the government to anticipate these problems and fix them? We have our doubts and worries about that too. There is an approaching threat. The storm isn't here yet. The sky is still and people are going about their day, but if we don't address these issues, the sky could grow slowly dark, the wind may pick up, and soon it will be too late. One is reminded of Merle Haggard's lyrics in 'America First': Who's on the Hill andwho's watchin' the valley?An' who's in charge of it all?Who is in charge of it all?

Herein lies the crunch.</p><p>To keep the amount of money that rolls into the tech titans every day, week, month and year growing they are going to have dip further into the pockets of their existing customers.</p><p>This create the danger of running up against two major areas of pushback: regulatory watchdogs around the world and their hundreds of millions of customers.</p><p>First, consumers. </p><p>At this point are there many people in Netflix's core markets who are natural customers for it but don't already use it?</p><p>Central to the appeal of the leading streaming service is its value for money proposition when compared to traditional satellite and cable TV providers. The volume of content versus the small price of around six dollars or pounds a month.</p><p>As it ratchets up its prices at what point does that key attraction become significantly eroded? In its recent set of number the signs were not good and investors reacted accordingly.</p><p>Google, which trades on the stock market under the Alphabet moniker, and Facebook face similar issues of market saturation but also a different, longer term threat.</p><p>There is a nascent move towards a decentralized internet, dubbed Web3. This heralds alternatives to the likes of Facebook and Youtube built on public blockchains such as Ethereum. They are effectively owned by their users or content creators rather than a single, central corporate entity.</p><p>How quickly people migrate over to these and to what degree will ultimately be a crucial factor in whether the tech giants are brought down from their lofty positions or not in the coming years.</p><p>The official numbers that Facebook puts out do not yet seem to show a huge drop-off in popularity for the social media site, but anecdotal evidence that many people no longer use the site with anything like the same enthusiasm as five or so years ago is widespread.</p><p>There is also the inescapable fact that every social networking site that has had success in the past has eventually fallen out of favour as fickle consumers lose interest or decide they like something else better. Myspace, Bebo and Friends Reunited being well known examples.</p><p>Another central risk area for big tech stocks is whether they have great innovations left in them to come or have already given the world their best ideas.</p><p>Apple stands out in this area. The ipod, iphone and ipad were revolutionary in their first few iterations.

In a review chaired by Nobel Laureate Professor Sir Angus Deaton and funded by the Nuffield Foundation, we intend not just to describe inequalities - in income, wealth, health, social mobility, political participation and more - but to understand what causes them and to offer concrete policy proposals to tackle them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We don't start from the presumption that all inequalities are indefensible; indeed, some are inevitable. But Sir Angus will observe that when the rules of the game are rigged, or when great inequalities in income and wealth result in great inequalities in political power and economic opportunity, then they risk disrupting both our democracy and our prosperity</p><p>'... in much of the rich world, where one or more of politics, economics and health are changing in worrisome ways. If working people are losing out because corporate governance is set up to favour shareholders over workers, or because the decline in unions has favoured capital over labour and is undermining the wages of workers at the expense of shareholders and corporate executives, then we need to change the rules.'</p><p>He will point to the risk of the UK following the US, where wages for non-college-educated men have not risen for five decades, and where rising mortality for less-educated white men and women in middle age has caused average life expectancy in America to fall for the last three years - something that has not happened for a century. We have not experienced anything similar in the UK but we have now had a decade of stagnant wages and there is recent evidence that 'deaths of despair' - deaths from suicide and drug and alcohol abuse - are now rising among middle-aged Britons. Sir Angus will go on to say:</p><p>'I think that people getting rich is a good thing, especially when it brings prosperity to others. But the other kind of getting rich, \"taking\" rather than \"making\", rent-seeking rather than creating, enriching the few at the expense of the many, taking the free out of free markets, is making a mockery of democracy. In that world, inequality and misery are intimate companions.'</p><p>Paul Johnson, Director of IFS, said:</p><p>'I can't think of anything more important than understanding what drives the inequalities we see today and working out what we might do to influence them. Everything from early childhood education to the regulation of \"big tech\", from the design of the benefit system to the effects of globalisation, from the role of men and women in the home to the design of corporate governance, matters for producing the outcomes we see. We will be examining them all.'</p><p>In an accompanying report, IFS researchers Robert Joyce and Xiaowei Xu set out a small selection of the key facts about inequality in the UK which have motivated the review:</p><p>* Income inequality in the UK is high by international standards. Of other major economies, only the US has higher income inequality.</p><p>* Nevertheless, inequality in total net household income has changed little since rising sharply in the 1980s. This is true despite the fact that household earnings inequality has risen. Our system of state transfers - especially tax credits - has been very successful at mitigating rising inequality.</p><p>* Deaths from suicide, drug overdoses and alcohol-related liver disease have been rising among middle-aged people in England - similar to (though on a smaller scale than) what has happened in the US since the turn of the century, where the trend has been shown to be concentrated heavily among the lower-educated population. In the UK, this new trend has contributed to a small rise in middle-age mortality overall in the last few years, bringing to an end decades of continual improvement.</p><p>* Family environments differ widely and are diverging. The proportion of people on high wages who live with a partner rose between 1994 and 2015, but among people in the bottom fifth of wages it declined by up to 20%. About one in six children in the UK are born to single parents - a phenomenon that is heavily concentrated in low-income and low-educated families, and is significantly less prevalent in continental Europe.</p><p>* Women's employment has risen dramatically from 57% in 1975 to 78% in 2017. But whilst white British women have nearly closed the employment gap with men, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are half as likely to work as men of the same ethnic group.</p><p>* The gender hourly wage gap is strongly associated with childbirth and rises from less than 10% at the point of childbirth to 30% 12 years after the first child is born. This reflects an extraordinary lack of earnings progression for mothers, particularly those who work part-time.</p><p>* There are stark geographical inequalities in the UK. Average weekly earnings in London are 66% higher than those in the North East. Men in the most affluent areas can expect to live nearly 10 years longer than those in the most deprived areas, and this gap is widening.</p><p>The report also considers some potential causes of current levels of inequality, including the hollowing out of the jobs market and the dramatic decline in union membership, from more than half of employees in 1980 to fewer than a quarter today (with just 13% of private sector employees now in unions). The review will look at these alongside the effects of globalisation, technological change, increased market power for some firms and changing family environments. It will consider a very wide array of policy interventions.</p><p>Tim Gardam, Chief Executive of the Nuffield Foundation, said:</p><p>'The Deaton Review is a project that sits at the heart of the Nuffield Foundation's purpose to advance opportunity and social well-being. The multidimensional nature of inequality is among the most contentious issues of our times. It frames the increasingly vehement debate about the distribution of income and wealth and the relationships between this and other inequalities such as gender, ethnicity and disability. It informs the growing anxiety over generational and geographical divisions and is fundamental to our understanding of concepts such as fairness, rights and identity.</p><p>'As an independent funder, the Nuffield Foundation believes the dispassionate analysis of evidence and argument that will come from the thinking of the distinguished panel, led by Sir Angus Deaton, has the potential to refashion what we know about inequality and present viable policy options for securing a more emancipated and inclusive society.'</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6729450 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6729450</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W41-SCK1-JC11-12SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1107\"/><timeReceived>7:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 14, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This week's hearings showed their transformation into trust busters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Wednesday, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, opened a half-virtual hearing on ''Online Platforms and Market Power'' with a combative opening statement: ''Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.'' </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  That set the tone for the hours of sharp questioning of four of the wealthiest people on the planet: Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, whose companies have a combined market value roughly equivalent to the G.D.P. of Japan.</p><p>  Given the history of Silicon Valley's relationship with Washington, the intensity and precision of some subcommittee members' questions were remarkable. It is a sign that significant tech regulation may be closer than we think.</p><p>  Despite its techno-libertarian image, the tech industry has had close political ties for decades and remarkable success in getting what it wants.</p><p>  In the late 1970s, venture capitalists and semiconductor chief executives got Capitol Hill and the Carter White House to agree to tax cuts and looser financial regulations. In the 1980s, a group of young legislators became such boosters of the industry that they were known as ''Atari Democrats.'' Ronald Reagan extolled Silicon Valley entrepreneurship and helped tech companies fend off Japanese competition.</p><p>  The bipartisan love affair intensified in the 1990s as Bill Clinton and Al Gore invited tech executives to shape early internet-era policymaking. Newt Gingrich, then the Republican speaker of the House, talked up cyberspace and formed close alliances with libertarian-minded tech thinkers. His party's leaders convened ''high-tech summits'' on Capitol Hill.</p><p>  The lightly regulated online economy we have today is a product of that decade, when Silicon Valley leaders persuaded starry-eyed lawmakers that young, scrappy internet companies could regulate themselves.</p><p>  Washington's embrace of tech continued even as questions emerged about the industry's wealth and power. A 2013 Senate hearing to interrogate Mr. Cook about Apple's tax avoidance quickly was sidetracked by lawmakers gushing to the chief executive about his company's innovative products. Mr. Pichai faced tough questions at a 2018 House Judiciary hearing, but also was showered with praise.</p><p>  ''Google is still the story of the American dream,'' declared Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the committee's chairman at the time.</p><p>  Those days seemed a dim memory Wednesday. Instead, the mood recalled the traffic safety debates of the mid-1960s that helped catalyze significantly more regulation for the auto industry. After a steady drumbeat of studies and some short-lived congressional inquiries, traffic safety exploded into the public consciousness starting with Senate hearings in the summer of 1965, where top auto executives faced sharp questions about their lax approach to safety.</p><p>  The evening network news programs showed Robert F. Kennedy, a newly elected senator from New York, grilling the leaders of General Motors about the tiny amount the company spent on safety research. Later that year a young lawyer advising the Senate committee, Ralph Nader, published a blockbuster expos\u00e9 of the industry, ''Unsafe at Any Speed.''</p><p>  This combination of political and media scrutiny led to passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which mandated seatbelts and additional car safety features, as well as road improvements like guardrails and traffic barriers.</p><p>  Wednesday felt like Big Tech's Ralph Nader moment: the pointed questioning by committee members, notably its Democratic women like Representatives Val Demings of Florida, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Lucy McBath of Georgia and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania; the crescendo of investigative journalism that, in part, led to this week's hearing by shining a critical light on Big Tech's practices. And now, this House subcommittee is merely one of several legislative or regulatory bodies considering limits on Big Tech's power.</p><p>  There are of course many reasons tech regulation may not come to pass. The issues at stake are wickedly complex, and quite different for each of these companies, something chief executives sought to underscore in the hearing.</p><p>  ''It appears to me,'' Mr. Bezos observed, ''that social media is a nuance-destruction machine, and I don't think that's helpful for a democracy.'' (Mr. Zuckerberg's reaction to that statement sadly was not visible to the audience.)</p><p>  Large tech companies also have prepared for the regulatory onslaught by starting some of the most well-funded lobbying operations in Washington. They learned a lesson from Microsoft, whose presence in the capital before its antitrust case in 1998 consisted of one employee who worked out of the back of his car because he lacked proper office space.</p><p>  Although the trial didn't end with Microsoft being ordered to break itself apart, it taught the company that government regulators needed to be taken seriously. And as a result Microsoft tamped down its most aggressive market practices, and escaped much of the yearslong policy scrutiny now facing its peers.</p><p>  Then there is the sticky problem of public opinion. During other seminal moments -- carmakers in the 1960s, tobacco in the 1990s -- the problems posed by unregulated bigness were clear-cut. Cigarettes killed people. Cars were unsafe.</p><p>  Tech's consumer dangers are harder to see and acutely feel on an average day: misinformation, an incomplete search result, an unfairly promoted link, privacy erosion, a skewed algorithm. We may wish we used our smartphones less, or worry about what overuse of social media is doing to our communities and brains.</p><p>  But we still routinely check our Facebook pages, buy apps via Apple, and click ''buy'' on Amazon Prime. Even if, as some representatives noted, we do so because we have little alternative.</p><p>  What happens next will depend on many things, including the November election. But this week marks the end of Washington's great love affair with tech, one that helped make these companies' bigness possible in the first place.</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The computer giant was brought to court in 1998 accused of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">restricting competition by selling in the same package its Windows operating system and web browser Internet</emphasis>Explorer, which in practice brought out rivals such as Netscape, who were slow to download or had to be purchased from a store. Eventually, Microsoft was convicted of monopoly and a judge ruled that it should be split in two, something that didn't happen.</p><p><br/>Now, more than 20 years later, the American technology sector is at a very similar junctive. In July, the Justice Department itself announced an investigation into Google, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon, </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook </emphasis>in which it will examine whether the business practices of these corporations are damaging competition in the digital world.<br/>In particular, what the body will judge is whether the most dominant technology corporations have grown in size and power in compliance with the law or whether it was precisely that size and power that has allowed them to sever competition and protect their position.<br/>These two decades, in which technology groups have forged their empires at the stroke of a checkbook, are often cited by those who argue that control over these companies has been too lukewarm. The number of monopoly cases filed by the US fell dramatically, from an average of 15.7 cases per year between 1970 and 1999, to less than three between 2000 and 2014.<br/>In fact, in Washington there are already voices, such as that of the Massachusetts Democratic Senator and Aspiring White House, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elizabeth</emphasis>Warren, who demand greater control over these companies, forcing them even to divide their businesses and reverse some acquisitions such as Facebook's Instagram.<br/>In April last year, Senator Lindsey Graham, during a session in the chamber, threw this question to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: \"Do<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">you think you have a monopoly?\"</emphasis> Obviously, the social network founder's answer was no. Then the senator refused to name him one of his competitors. Zuckerberg wasn't able to find any. And he didn't find them because they don't exist.<br/>With more than 2 billion users worldwide, no one can shade Facebook's empire, which also includes Instagram and WhatsApp, for which it spent more than $23 billion. The company has been especially skilled in deactivating its competitors. An example is what happened with Snapchat: Zuckerberg tried to buy the company when its ephemeral videos attracted thousands of users. Its founder, Evan Spiegel, refused and Facebook ended up copying this functionality to create his Stories.<br/>\"The best way to maintain a dominant position in a market as dynamic as technology is to use the ungainly profits you make in one market to buy the winner in another,\" explains Ben Thompson, author of the technology analysis website Stratechery. In the last decade, the five major tech titans (MicrosoftGoogle, Amazon, Facebook and Apple) have made <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">431 acquisitions worth $155 billion</emphasis> (139 billion euros), according to data collected byBloomberg.<br/>Sherman Law<br/>Their strong commitment to innovation, huge cash reserves and their ability to create new markets have allowed these companies to acquire huge market shares. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google and Facebook accumulate 60% of mobile advertising revenue and 51% for digital</emphasis>advertising, according to eMarketer data. Amazon, meanwhile, channels 47% of all e-commerce sales in the US.<br/>For Thompson, under the current antitrust law, these percentages alone do not seem sufficient to mobilize regulators. \"Market definitions are very fuzzy. Most people have multiple social media accounts, both on Facebook and others, meaning that any definition of market share would have to depend on another measure,\" he says.<br/>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sherman</emphasis>Act, passed in 1890 and responsible for regulating monopolies in the United States, states that a company is engaging in monopolistic behavior when it has \"significant and lasting market power\", that is, it has the long-term ability to increase the price or exclude competitors.<br/>The fact that the leadership position must be sustainable over time is the argument these companies turn to to deny their so-called monopolies. Big Tech argue that their dominance is not durable because entry barriers are low for new competitors. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">As Google likes to say, the competition is just \"one click away\".</emphasis><br/>However, this is not always so simple. As Sally Hubbard, former assistant to New York's attorney general and antitrust law expert, argues, tech giants have \"platform privileges.\" That is, the incentive and the ability to prioritize their own goods and services over those of competitors who depend on their platforms. And it gives Google a $5 billion fine to Google for requiring manufacturers to pre-install their Android operating system on phones.<br/>In his view, the Microsoft case 20 years ago illustrates how today's tech firms break the law. \"Then Microsoft used its power as a monopoly to try to control the Internet browser market. Ironically, if the Department of Justice hadn't sued Microsoft to stop its anti-competitive behavior, Google might not exist today,\" Hubbard concludes.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8034508</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSB-W8C1-DY1R-B4TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 8, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

On July 29, the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook spent more than five hours fielding tough questions about their overwhelming market power from a bipartisan antitrust panel in the U.S. House of Representatives. Is the end of an era approaching?   In many ways, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a boon for tech companies. As Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg all noted in their opening statements at the antitrust hearing, people appreciate the services their companies provide. Recent research indicates that the COVID-19 crisis has deepened this appreciation .    This is not surprising. Digital technologies have enabled workers to do their jobs from home, students to continue their classes while schools are closed, and people to stay in touch with loved ones and entertain themselves while sheltering in place.   Tech companies have been reaping enormous benefits from this shift. In the first half of 2020, while the global economy confronted an unprecedented recession, Amazon\u2019s share price rose by about 40 percent , fueled by rising online purchases and increased used of cloud services. Zoom\u2019s market value has more than tripled since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, as it became a hub for remote meetings and online socializing.   As for Google and Facebook, they suffered temporary losses from reduced advertising revenues. But they still account for an overwhelming share of the digital-advertising market \u2014 four-fifths in the United Kingdom , to cite one example. Moreover, while Google and Facebook are free to use, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concluded that consumers are effectively paying for their services indirectly through advertising revenues , at a rate of \u00a3500 ($656) per household annually \u2014 a testament to their market power.   It is too early to say how much of people\u2019s lives will move online, or for how long. People may fear COVID-19, but they also suffer from Zoom fatigue . Nonetheless, it seems likely that work and social patterns will undergo some sustained changes, which will have far-reaching policy implications.   For starters, closing the digital divide will become more urgent than ever. Of the many forms of inequality the pandemic is exposing and exacerbating, unequal access to the internet and digital technologies is among the most prominent.   All the services that have made lives so much better under social-distancing rules \u2014 from remote working to online shopping to streaming services \u2014 are available only to those with access to a reasonably fast and reliable internet connection and suitable hardware. Many are also receiving health care and accessing government support online, further highlighting the critical importance of universal access.   In recent years, governments have increasingly recognized this imperative. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission made closing the digital divide a high priority. And yet about one in 20 people in the United States still have no high-speed internet connection . In rural areas, about one-third of households are not connected. The figures are similarly bleak in the U.K.   Closing the gap will require large-scale investment in digital infrastructure, including broadband connectivity and 5G for mobile services. In both the U.S. and the U.K. , governments are working to deliver on the first imperative, by making the low-return rural investments that cannot attract private capital. Progress on the second imperative may be more difficult, owing to political opposition to the Chinese telecoms giant and 5G leader Huawei.   But Huawei may be turn out to be the tip of an iceberg, because the current shift online will lead to greater political and regulatory scrutiny of tech giants. For one thing, regulators are likely to pressure telecommunications companies to increase investment, spurring debates about license obligations and pricing (how much companies must invest, and how they will fund it). Past disputes about where along the value chain costs should fall \u2014 from physical network operators to streaming services \u2014 may re-emerge.   But, as the recent U.S. antitrust hearing suggests, the most contentious issue will probably be the market power of digital companies. Even in today\u2019s highly polarized political environment, growing concern about Big Tech \u2014 including the viability of small producers and the economy\u2019s dependence on digital market access \u2014 is broadly shared. And U.S. regulators have already signaled their concern, with inquiries by both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice .   The European Union is far ahead of the U.S. when it comes to regulating, taxing, and constraining Big Tech. The European Commission has pursued multiple antitrust cases against the tech giants, as well as broader initiatives such as the proposed Digital Services Act . Margrethe Vestager \u2014 previously the European commissioner for competition, and currently executive vice president of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age \u2014 has led the way on this front.   In the U.K., the CMA is working to implement the Furman Review , a government-commissioned report on digital-market competition published in March 2019. The panel recommended subjecting strategically important companies to targeted regulation, including a code of conduct that will likely cover issues such as favoring one\u2019s own services, changes in terms and conditions and pre-notification of all mergers.   It remains to be seen how such efforts will play out, especially in a U.S. headed toward a highly contentious presidential election. But one thing is clear: Though the tech monopolists may capture significant short-term gains from the accelerating shift online, they can no longer avoid the harsh glare of the political spotlight. The writing may be on the wall.

Mike Lee and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who is also in the midst of a race for her party's 2020 presidential nomination.</p><p>Lee and Klobuchar co-chair the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, and the duo have now scheduled two hearings this month with big tech antitrust issues in their sights. The bipartisan interest in inquiries focused on big tech - and the question of how much power is too much - appears to be on the rise.</p><p>Lee said while not all tech acquisitions are of a predatory nature, more input is needed to assess what, if any, additional legislation may be needed to ensure fair competition in the tech sector.</p><p>\"Acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors by dominant digital platforms can be pro-competitive, but they also run the risk of eliminating the very competition that may challenge the incumbent firm's leading position in the future,\" Lee said in a statement. \"We are holding this hearing to gain a better understanding of the various concerns raised by these transactions and to examine how the antitrust agencies analyze such mergers.</p><p>\"In addition to the hearing, the subcommittee also is interested in soliciting input from policy analysts, market participants and other stakeholders on whether legislative action relating to such mergers is needed to ensure digital markets remain competitive.\"</p><p>Klobuchar cited an unchecked trend among tech goliaths in snapping up startups that have the earmarks of future adversaries, a practice she says has potential downstream harms for consumers in the areas of product choice, pricing and personal privacy.</p><p>\"This is an important hearing,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"In recent years we have seen a record number of mergers that have raised serious competition issues. Big technology companies have become some of the most powerful organizations in the world. They face little competition and there are numerous examples of the companies purchasing startup competitors in various lines of business. These companies' practices can limit options for consumers, distort prices and stifle innovation.</p><p>Klobuchar said the government has failed to adequately regulate or police such practices, and she is a supporter of enhancing both legislative and enforcement responses to protect U.S. consumers.</p><p>\"With virtually no meaningful pushback from our government, these companies have reshaped the meaning of American privacy, the purchasing of goods and services, and the workings of our elections and our democracy,\" Klobuchar said. \"To respond to these concerns, I have continually advocated for 1) changes to our laws; 2) aggressive enforcement of the laws on the books; and 3) adequate funding for the (Federal Trade Commission) and (U.S. Department of Justice) antitrust division. I will be asking questions about the effects of tech company mergers on competition and steps to address these problems.\"</p><p>A Lee spokesman said the hearing on tech acquisitions is scheduled for Sept. 24 but a final witness list has yet to be released. Just a week before, Lee and Klobuchar will have the opportunity to question FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and Makan Delrahim from the Department of Justice's antitrust division\u00a0on issues related to oversight and enforcement of antitrust laws as they relate to big U.S. tech interests.</p><p>The new hearing comes close behind reports, confirmed by Facebook in a July earnings report, that the FTC has already begun an antitrust investigation into the company. That inquiry appears to be focused on acquisitions potentially intended to defend Facebook's dominant market position, including buying photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and instant-messaging platform WhatsApp in 2014. Both acquisitions have been cited by academics and industry-watchers as examples of blatantly anti- competitive strategies.</p><p>In July, University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law professor and antitrust expert Jorge Contreras told the Deseret News that he and other legal experts where taken aback by the lack of a federal response to Facebook's $1 billion acquisition of Instagram. The move, he said, was seen by many as a case of Facebook simply buying up a potential competitor before it grew big enough to pose a business risk.</p><p>\"I think the Facebook- Instagram merger, with almost no opposition from the government, really sent off alarm bells, at least among academics and observers,\" Contreras said. \"The collective response was, 'What is going on here?

Introduction</p><p>The 2016 was a bad year for traders and investors. First, the recession scare in January following the great Chinese currency deterioration, the market decrease of oil price attaining $25 a barrel coupled with sharp credit markets tumbling. Second, the nk of Japan pursued the European experiment with negative interest rates, which arises a vexing question about the appropriateness of global central banks to help avoiding an untoward event of a real economic downturn. Add to this the geopolitical development; On Friday, 24 June 2016, it was officially announced that the United Kingdom (UK) voted to withdraw from the European Union (EU), resulting in what is commonly known as \"Brexit\". This result was surprising by the vast majority of capital market participants and even on the day of the referendum, bookmakers' odds supposed a 90 percent chance that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU would fail (Bloomberg 2016). In fact, the historic decision by British voters to pursue Brexit was very shocking for investors and regulators. The traders' panicky knee-jerk response highlights their belief that the decision to leave the Europe would harm the home-grown businesses. Soon after the Brexit results, many experts have predicted that UK stocks will crash markedly given the uncertainty over the potential timing and terms of a managed UK exit from the European Union. David Reid -Portfolio Manager at Black Rock- has gone a step further, forecasting which stock-market sectors will get hit hardest in the onset of Brexit. Some sectors are expected to lose less than others.</p><p>To mitigate harmful consequences, UK industries (especially the largest losers from the announcement of Brexit) have to make important economic choices based on the resulting policy environment (Brogaard and Detzel 2015; Schiereck et al. 2016). In fact, the referendum on the UK's EU membership can be viewed as a sharp change in UK government policy. Normally, policy changes lead to a drop of stock prices, especially when the anxiety over such change is greater. Accordingly, Tielmann and Schiereck (2017) provided evidence that Brexit had strong detrimental impacts on UK financials and logistics companies owing to the wider uncertainty with respect to the future UK-EU relationship. Several financial institutions placed their EU headquarter in the UK to gain from the developed UK financial market (in particular, the financial technology also known as \"Fintech\") and the European passporting rules to undertake investments in other EU members. Nevertheless, the Brexit vote exacerbated fears regarding the prospects of the operations of international financial and banking institutions and the regulatory environment, since it is unclear whether the institutions located in the UK will remain enjoy a full access to EU financial markets.</p><p>Prior research on the impact of sudden events and changes in government policy documented an adverse influence on share markets. For example, Kolaric and Schiereck (2016) investigated the reactions of airline stock prices over the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels. By examining 27 of the biggest U.S., Canadian, and European airlines firms, they deduced that the adjustment of stock prices is in line with the assumption of efficient capital markets. The reaction to the attack events seems significant for all the companies studied, due to the unprecedented damages caused by this sudden event and the particular attention these events receive from the media and social networking. Potentially, they showed that the largest companies are more threatened by the attacks than the smaller industries, and thus the effect of a sudden event on the performance of companies depend on their sizes. They also suggested that stocks do not depend to the net income in the year prior to the event. So far, the empirical research on Brexit remains rather limited, with some analyses focusing on the overall impact of Brexit for different countries (Balis 2016; Bouoiyour and Selmi 2016; Ham 2016), while others concentrate on specific sectors, whose core business is directly affected by the UK's withdrawal from EU such as logistics (Tielmann and Schiereck 2017) and airlines (Kolaric and Schiereck 2016). Bouoiyour and Selmi (2016) tried to test whether the way in which Brexit was disseminated by media causes disquiet among investors in UK and Europe. Using quantile regression model and frequency domain causality test, they showed that the reactions of UK and EU equities to Brexit are heterogeneous. Indeed, the stock market of Germany suffered more than that of UK and France. In addition, Oehler et al. (2017) carried out an event study analysis to investigate the abnormal stock returns following the Brexit referendum. They documented that stocks of firms with larger proportions of domestic sales realized more negative abnormal returns than stocks of firms with more sales abroad. In other words, they deduced that the international diversification help to mitigate the detrimental influences of Brexit on stock abnormal returns. Besides, Bouoiyour and Selmi (2017) tested whether the way in which Brexit was communicated in social media affect the performance of UK defense and aerospace stocks. They showed that the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit event puts at risk defense and aerospace companies (negative and significant influence on defense and aerospace stock returns) that benefit from EU membership with access to integrated European supply chains, Research and Development funding and collaborative procurement programmes. Moreover, Ramiaha et al. (2017) assessed the effect the EU referendum results on various sectors of the British economy. They found that Brexit has a mixed influence on the abnormal returns with sharp sector-by-sector differences. They indicated also that the banking and travel and leisure sectors were typically more responsive to the Brexit outcome.The present study explores, at sectoral level, the British stock market behavior around the announcement of the Brexit result and addresses the following questions. Do markets anticipate the Brexit outcome? Are British stock markets efficient? Are stock markets resilient in dealing with the uncertainty arising from this event? Is there homogeneity in stock market behavior around the Brexit result between the different sectors? What would be the investing implications of Brexit? We explore these questions using a standard event study methodology that examines the abnormal returns behaviors for several sectors of the British equity market (Financials, Oil and Gas, Real estate, Defense and Airlines, Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Consumer goods and Technology) around the announcement date. This study complements and contributes to the existing literature by testing the Uncertain Information Hypothesis (UIH) of Brown et al. (1988). This hypothesis assumes that markets absorb news and political trends into asset prices in anticipation of the event (in this case, the Brexit result). Policy changes may lead generally to falling stock prices, particularly if the uncertainty is greater (Pastor and Veronesi 2012). Much of the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit outcome may be resolved after the announcement date, i.e., once the uncertainty over Brexit is mitigated, stock prices would rise again (Pantzalis et al. 2000).</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our formal hypothesis and describe the methodology and the data sources. Section 3 reports and discusses the empirical findings. Section 4 concludes and provides some policy implications for UK companies in upheaval.</p><p>2. Hypotheses, methodology and data</p><p>Since Efficient Market Hypothesis has arisen in the 1960s (Fama 1965), it has been subject to a huge number of researches. In efficient capital markets, we anticipate that equity prices will adjust at once without any overreaction and that the necessary adjustments become smaller if a certain kind of event occurs repeatedly. Nonetheless, as Lo (2004) argued, there is no consensus among finance academics as to whether stock market is efficient. Most of them believe the market is weak-form efficient (Doran et al. 2010); Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) even claimed that a perfectly efficient market is impossible. This contradiction has yielded to the emergence of new hypotheses in behavioral finance including the Uncertain Information Hypothesis of Brown et al (1988). The Uncertain Information Hypothesis assumes that anxiety will rise in financial markets following the occurrence of unexpected event. So that investors cannot appropriately respond to unanticipated new information and thus they could in the early stages set security prices below their fundamental values. Moreover, this hypothesis asserts that the stock return is stronger than the average return over periods when no event-induced uncertainty happens. The first hypothesis to be tested consists, therefore, of two parts:</p><p>H[1.sub.a] : [CAR.sub.-5;0] &gt; 0 (1)</p><p>H[1.sub.b] : [CAR.sub.0;+1] &gt; 0 (2)</p><p>When the event-induced uncertainty is reduced, positive abnormal returns are expected in the time period following the occurrence of the event. In this study, we assess the five-day period after the announcement date to test our second hypothesis:</p><p>H2: [CAR.sub.+1;+5] &gt; 0 (3)</p><p>This research is interested on the UK referendum and evaluates, at sectoral level, the impact of the UK's decision to leave the EU on UK stock market prices. The referendum outcome was not announced until June 24 2016, which we subsequently view as the Brexit announcement day. Our sample data include seven sectors of stock indices. The sector indices offer some insights of the performance of the UK equity market. The selected industries include financials (banks, insurance, reinsurance and financial services), real estate, oil and gas (oil and gas producers, oil equipment, and services, distribution and alternative energy), pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, technology (software and computer services, and technology hardware and equipment), defense and airlines, and consumer goods. Each sector index represents a capitalization-weighted portfolio of the largest UK firms in this sector. The sectoral UK stock market data are available at Datastream database. For defense and airlines, we use NMX2710 share price index where the historical data are available in UK live charts (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.livecharts.co.uk/share_prices/historic-data-NMX2710-start-30\">http://www.livecharts.co.uk/share_prices/historic-data-NMX2710-start-30</url>).</p><p>In practice, we define the day \"0\" as the day of the event for a given equity. Thereafter, the estimation and event windows can be determined (Figure 1). The interval [t1 + 1, t2] is the event window with length l2=t2-t1-1, whereas the interval [t0+1, t1] is the estimation window with length l1=t1-t0-1. The length of the event window often depends on the ability to accurately date the announcement date. If one is able to date it precisely, the event window will be less lengthy and capturing the abnormal returns will be more proper and effective. We should mention here that the length of the event window including the event days normally range between 21 and 121 days (Peterson 1989). For our case of study, we use for each sector a maximum of 120 daily stock return observations for the period around the day of the Brexit vote, beginning at day - 115 and ending at day + 5 relative to the event. The first 110 days (- 115 through -5) is denoted as \"the estimation period\", and the following 11 days (- 5 through + 5) is designated as \"the event period\".</p><p>Based on the return model chosen, event studies consist generally of applying an event window only (for example, the market-adjusted model) or an event and an estimation window (for instance, the market model). Most common, the market model is carried out. It predicts normal returns with a regression investigation that regresses stock returns on market returns over the estimation window. Through this assessment, the relationship between the stock and its reference index is captured in two parameters ([[??].sub.i] and [[??].sub.i]). Figure 1 sketches the data structure used by event studies and offers information on how this data structure is employed by the market model. The cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for a sector i during the event window [[[tau].sub.1]; [[tau].sub.2]] surrounding the event day t = 0, where [[[tau].sub.1]; [[tau].sub.2]] = [epsilon][ -5; +5], is expressed as follows:</p><p>[mathematical expression not reproducible] (4)</p><p>where [mathematical expression not reproducible] is the cumulative abnormal return of share i during the event window [[[tau].sub.1]; [[tau].sub.2]], [R.sub.i,t] is the realized return of stock i on day t (1), [R.sub.M,t] is the return of the benchmark index of sector i, [[??].sub.i] and [[??].sub.i] are the regression estimates from an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression for 105 trading day estimation period until t = -10. We employ the Datastream's value-weighted total return stock market index of sector i's country of origin as the benchmark index. As mentioned above we set our event day for the Brexit event to Friday, 24 June 2016, at the close of the trading day in the United Kingdom. We next assess if the equity market reaction to the announcement of the Brexit outcome varies with the characteristics of the firm making the investment. McConnell and Nantell (1985), Keown et al., (1999) and Jones and Danbolt (2004) indicated that the equity market response to the occurrence of an unanticipated event vary with company size, with investments by small companies being related with wider abnormal returns. Indeed, we hypothesize that the level of abnormal returns will be negatively associated to company size. Burton et al. (1999) claimed that the market reacts differently to the announcement of joint ventures compared to single company investments; it responds more favorably to joint ventures when investments are heavily risky. Accordingly, Woolridge and Snow (1990) and Jones and Danbolt (2004) and Jones et al. (2004) asserted that joint ventures announcements are likely to be associated with weaker but significant positive abnormal returns. Throughout this study and based on the existing literature, we hypothesize that joint ventures announcements will exert a positive effect on the abnormal returns of the different sectors under study. Furthermore, we account for the effect of growth opportunities on the abnormal returns. We hypothesize that the equity return will react more strongly to investment announcements by firms with valuable growth opportunities than for other companies, even though in their investigation of UK investment announcements, Burton et al. (1999) showed insignificant influence of the growth opportunities on the abnormal returns. In this study, we incorporate in the regression to be estimated two indicators for growth opportunities, and assume that companies with high price-earnings ratios or low dividend yields will witness more favorable stock market response to the announcement of Brexit outcome than other companies. Moreover, Woolridge and Snow (1990) and Chaney and Devinney (1992), using US data, argued that the stock market on average react positively to product diversification announcements associated with pronounced mean abnormal returns. In the same context, Jones et al. (2004) investigated the stock market response to investment announcements in the UK, and found positive response of the mean abnormal returns to new product or service innovations by UK companies of 0.87%. Recently, Kolaric and Schiereck (2016)' findings revealed that the reactions of stock returns to the uncertainty surrounding an event may depend on the net income of a firm in the year before the occurrence of the event, and on whether the studied industries are regionally or internationally focused companies.</p><p>The sectoral analysis of reactions of abnormal returns to the announcement of Brexit outcome is then undertaken using a linear regression model. The regression to be estimated is expressed as follows:</p><p>[mathematical expression not reproducible] (5)</p><p>where [mathematical expression not reproducible] is the dependent variable, Brexit is a dummy variable which takes the value of one on the first day of trading after the referendum and zero otherwise, created to capture the immediate risk, size is the logarithm of the total assets of a firm in U.S. dollars in the year prior to the event, JV is a dummy variable taking a value of 1 for joint ventures and 0 otherwise, PE is the price-earnings ratio, and DY is the dividend yield (in percentage) calculated by dividing the dollar value of dividends paid in a given year per share of stock held by the dollar value of one share of stock, PDI is a dummy variable to control for the announcement of a product diversification investment, which takes a value of 1 for new product launches, and 0 otherwise; EU is defined as 1 if the company's headquarter is located in Europe, and the Net income is the logarithm of the net income of a firm in dollars in the year prior to the event, and [[epsilon].sub.i] is the error term.</p><p>3. Discussion of results</p><p>3.1. Results</p><p>Figure 2 graphically depicts the cumulative abnormal return performance of UK industries for the announcement on 24 June 2016. The standard market model according to Dodd and Warner (1983) and Brown and Warner (1985) is employed for the determination of the CAR. Positive and negative CARs imply favourable and unfavourable outcomes, respectively. We show that the UK stock price responses of different sectors surrounding the Brexit seem dissimilar either for the announcement day CAR or the [-5; + 5] event window CAR. The Brexit is associated to severe stock prices declines for financials, real estate and defense and airlines from the day relative to the announcement of Brexit (t=0). For technology, a drop of the stock price is shown after the Brexit vote or particularly for [0; +5] event window CAR. However, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and consumer goods do appear less sensitive to the day relative to the Brexit announcement or [0; 0] event window CARs. The findings of the event study of the CAR performances around the announcement of the Brexit outcome are not in line with the UIH hypothesis. In the majority of sectors, we note a sharp decrease of abnormal returns in the day relative to the announcement of the Brexit outcome (t=0), without surging again after the Brexit vote.</p><p>Table 1 takes a look at the stock response to the Brexit announcement for Financials, Oil and Gas, Real estate, Defense and Airlines, Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Consumer goods and Technology. The results show that the stock market reactions are negative and significant for almost all the industries under study and irrespective whether [0; 0], [0; +1] and [+1; +5] window event CARs are accounted for, except for Oil and Gas where we find an insignificant specific-share response for [0; 0] and [+1; +5] window event. But the reaction appears much less detrimental for pharmaceuticals and biotech and consumer goods. In a nutshell, we can distinguish three groups of sectors: The first one includes Financials, Defense &amp; Airlines, Real Estate and Technology where the stock prices fall strongly in the day of the announcement of Britain's withdrawal from the EU membership and in the post-Brexit announcement by utilizing the [0; 0], [0; +1] and [+1; + 5] event window CAR as the endogenous variable. The second group is formed by Oil and Gas companies where their responses seem insignificant after the Brexit vote, and slightly negative in the day relative to the referendum announcement (t=0). The third group contains the sectors which experienced a moderate influence whatever the window event CAR investigated (i.e., Pharmaceuticals and Biotech and Consumer goods). Because some of these sectors are cyclical while the others are defensive, one can expect that various industries could respond distinctly to changes in the economy and as a result the anxiety over Brexit would have varying sectoral effects. With respect portfolio allocation, investors and traders seek to shift the portfolio into sectors that appear less influenced by sudden events or risks.</p><p>Furthermore, the coefficient for SIZE is also significant and persistently negative for financials, real estate and defense and airlines across all the windows studied, suggesting that largest companies are likely to be more threatened by the Brexit fear than the smallest industries. The announcement of product diversification projects lead to significant and positive abnormal returns for all sectors, with the exception of Consumer goods. We show also that joint ventures announcements are significantly associated with small but significant positive abnormal returns for all the sectors under consideration. Additionally, we document a positive (negative) relationship between price-earnings ratio (dividend yield) and abnormal returns. Our findings are, therefore, in line with the literature suggesting that companies with high price-earnings ratios and low dividend yields will experience positive stock market responses. The results for the dividend yield suggest that there is a negative but small adjustment to abnormal return depending on the dividend yields. Further, the profits of UK industries do not help to consistently explain the stock prices evolution, as the net income's coefficient seems only significant for financials and real estate sectors using the [+1; + 5] event window CAR as the dependent variable. Also, the location of companies' headquarters help to explain the abnormal returns, as the coefficients for EU are significant for the different sectors, except some cases.</p><p>3.2. Interpretations</p><p>The results indicate that Financials is one of the most damaged sectors from Brexit. The UK financial system is strongly interconnected with the Europe. A Brexit could thus jeopardize UK financial stability. The withdrawal from the EU would end passporting rights, making the UK operations of European Economic Area (EEA) banks and European operations of UK banks harder to pursue. With the Britain's exit from the EU, much of UK activities denominated in Euros might likely to move to the Eurozone. Relocating such activities would undoubtedly generate burly uncertainty into the financial system. Further, barring a negotiated agreement after the Brexit announcement, some sectors like insurance and funds sector would be highly threatened by losing access to the single market. Being cut out from European Union' capital market could make the British financial industry less competitive in longer time horizons.</p><p>The Brexit affects also negatively and strongly Defense and Airlines companies. A lack of investment over geopolitical instability would likely erode the competitive position of defense and aerospace firms and adversely impact their revenue and profitability. The UK defense and aerospace firms are likely to be heavily damaged due to its highly integrated supply chains (2) across Europe and its great dependence to Europe's Research and Development (R&amp;D) funds. Specifically, the current Britain's decision to quit EU would harmfully affect mobility of skilled resources. For example, the increased integration across EU and UK has facilitated the Airbus access to highly skilled workers. This mobility is vital to the operating model and proves the efficacy of an EU dominated supply chain. More precisely, Airbus has a widest proportion of UK workers based in France and Germany (with less extent Spain, Everitt et al. 2016) that can be deployed at any time. Moreover, the EU employs funding competitions called Framework Programmes to deliver research grants while attempting to improve all sectors among European countries including defence and aerospace. UK benefited largely from these grants. For instance, the seventh Framework Programme that runs between 2007 and 2013 awarded around 14 per cent of the total 33 billion [euro] funding to the UK economy where almost 6 per cent was attributed to aerospace, security and arm sector. In this way, Brexit would harm innovation, trade and competitiveness. In this context, Nick Sanders, Executive Chairman Gardner Aerospace3 proclaimed \"I would think that life would be a lot more difficult for Gardner outside of the EU. Our biggest customer is based in France and anything that made trade more difficult would be a negative for us. Items such as customs documentation and potential import duties would add considerably to cost and bureaucracy.\" In brief, Brexit presents a real risk to the UK defense and aerospace technological bases. Specifically, the European aerospace and defense companies rely on heavier partnerships to share appropriate technological and industrial programs. One can mention, for instance, that the latest UK Strategic Defense and Security Review (2015) opened the way for a protraction of a partnership across UK and France, aimed at stimulating unmanned combat aerial vehicle designed for aircraft carrier-based operations. Overall, with the vote to leave Europe, the Defense and Airlines sector tumbled from lessened access to R &amp; D funds, the reduced technological partnership and the climbed tax and administrative burdens that would undoubtedly have a detrimental influence on the defense and aerospace industries operating across the British Channel (Balis 2016; Ham 2016; Bouoiyour and Selmi 2017).</p><p>Besides, the real estate market will face challenging issues with the UK vote to leave Europe. The devaluation of the British pound could trigger inflationary pressures and a rise in interest rates, which would in turn erode disposable income and lead to less homes being built, especially if accompanied with job losses and declining house prices. Accordingly, the UK Head of real estate asserted that two thirds of investors believed that voting to leave EU would slow down investment into UK property companies over the period of uncertainty until new terms of engagement with Europe are being worked out. Moreover, like all commodities, real estate prices are determined by supply and demand. The demand will collapse, but the good news for investors is that supply will decrease too. The cheaper pound will be good news for some investors, too. Exports will be cheaper for foreign buyers, that is to say that some firms will be positively influenced, supporting industrial and warehouse rents. Expectedly, the UK may be attractive as it becomes cheap compared to other European markets such as France and Germany. There is also positive news for student accommodation, as UK university fees for overseas students will drop sharply.</p><p>Further, Brexit is likely to exert a strong effect on technology. This outcome is not surprising; London is seen as the financial capital of Europe and the most irresistible city for startups. It has been an attractive location for several big tech industries (for example, Apple, Cisco, IBM and Google) to achieve European operations. With the onset of Brexit, London will lose these positions. Also, Startups seeking access to European grants and different EU programs and projects, like for example the Horizon 2020 program, will likely move their operations to European cities. Additionally, UK tech companies will lack the opportunity to participate in a European-funded project for next-generation mobile technology. It is obvious then that in the onset of Brexit, EU nationals will need over the next years visas to work and reside in the United Kingdom. These circumstances will harm the capability of UK tech firms to hire the engineers, data scientists, as well as the information technology workers they need from Europe.</p><p>Nevertheless, the UK Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology and Consumer goodsfocused companies appear less damaged. One of the potential elements that may explain this outcome is that these companies are among those likely to go unscathed from a weaker pound Sterling since they bring their sales outside the UK. The depreciation of Sterling vis-a-vis the dollar will make the products of these companies more competitive and result in a sharp boost when converted back into British pound. Interestingly, Pharmaceuticals and Biotech industries are not highly sensitive to macroeconomic and financial uncertainties; even in times of economic distress and political turmoil, people do not stop requiring life-saving drugs. Laying aside these short-term effects for pharmaceutical firms, the Britain's withdrawal from the EU may present a long-term challenge to both Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology companies. In particular, the Britain's \"divorce\" with Europe will have implications for the way drugs are regulated. Potentially, the ambition of Britain to become the third largest Biotech cluster in the world, after Boston and San Francisco becomes doubtful, according to the proclamation of the chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. Likewise, the Britain's Oil and Gas industries react slightly to the Brexit announcement since they do business mostly in U.S. dollars around the world; in this way, oil might play a \"safe haven\" role. It is also expected that after the decision to leave EU, UK will implement its own renewable and low carbon energy policy, and thus, the alternative energy sector will not be highly influenced.</p><p>4. Conclusions and some policy implications</p><p>The Britain's exit from the European Union and the uncertainty associated with it receive nowadays far-reaching attention. This article seeks to shed some light on the costs of \"Brexit\" by examining the reactions of different sectors of UK stock market to the Brexit announcement.</p><p>Even though the initial effect of any major event may involve a negative abnormal returns because of higher levels of uncertainty as the new information is being assessed and absorbed, once the long-term costs of Brexit are analyzed, equity markets may return to their pre-event condition. Inconsistently with the Uncertain Information Hypothesis, the reactions stock values of UK firms are not reversed within our window of analysis. Our findings indicate that the British industries are not resilient in dealing with uncertainty. The event-study methodology conducted in this study around the day of Brexit vote uncovers evidence of negative abnormal returns but with different degrees. In particular, Financials, Defense and Airlines, Real estate and Technology face series of difficult challenges following the Brexit vote, with a host of pressing issues facing the sectors, whereas Oil and GGas, Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology and Consumer goods experienced a moderate influence.</p><p>Several elements can explain how Financials, Defense and Airlines, Real estate and Technology are the biggest losers. Among them, one can cite the Britain's ability to still enjoy European passporting rules to establish investments, to participate in European funded-projects (i.e., the increased doubts over the UK's capability to win future project grants), without ignoring the opportunity to recruit skilled workers. The UK was, in 2014/2015, the most attractive destination for foreign direct investment in the EU with the USA, India and France being the widest contributors. Foreign investors who perceive investment opportunities in UK firms as a gateway to accessing EU markets can be put off by the current UK's withdrawal. This decision would complicate the investment negotiations with potential partners like China and India. Indeed, when UK belonged to Europe, negotiations were easier given the growing importance of Europe as a world power. Moreover, much of the debate around Britain's membership of the EU has focused on the need to limit the flow of immigration. But how and to what extent such decision will affect the many UK businesses which employ EU migrants and rely abundantly on the international talent? The EU's Office for National Statistics (Eurostat) indicated that 2,108,000 skilled workers from European countries reside in Britain. With potential skills in industries including Fintech, Logistics, Big Data, engineering and information Technology, EU migrants play a vital role in the development of UK economy. Even though, it is unclear up to now what status European migrants would have in the onset of the Brexit and to what extent this decision will impact the extent of movement policy, there are great concerns about the significant effect of Brexit on the ability of UK industries to hire the highly skilled workers that they need. It must be added that a reduction in the movement of migrant labour may result to less homes being built, which can lead to real troubles for the property companies and then to housing crisis.</p><p>Mitigating the Brexit costs depends potentially on how the UK and the remaining Member States of the EU might manage their relationships following the announcement of Brexit. With the decision of Britain's electorate to withdraw from the EU, leaders will try to search effective and drastic strategies to anchor their Britain's foreign policy in the next years. For Financials, for example, the British government would seek to undertake parallel EU and non-EU compliant frameworks to improve the flexibility of the UK as a financial centre attracting a large variety of global banks and financial services providers. For Airlines sector, the continuation of a liberal and deregulated aerospace market within the UK and Europe, implying that all European and British airlines can continue to operate as they yet do, is one of the most important points UK authorities will have to urgently negotiate with their European counterparts. For Technology, to preserve its leadership in innovation and long-run support of the digital economy, high techcompanies must call for continued cohesion and collaboration with their EU partners.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.25428/1824-2979/201802-277-292\">http://dx.doi.org/10.25428/1824-2979/201802-277-292</url></p><p>Acknowledgement</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the deep and thorough review and for the thoughtful comments and constructive suggestions, which help to improve the quality of our manuscript.

Figure 1. Data structure of an event study Event date Estimation Window The estimation window provides the information needed to specify the 'normal return'. E.g,, in the case of the 'market model', the stock returns a re regressed on the market returns in order to specify the typical relationship between the stock of the focal firm and its reference index. Notably, an intercept (alpha), a slope (beta) and an error term (sigma) are retrieved and then used to predict the 'normal returns' for the event window. Event Window Based on the actual returns during the event window and the 'normal returns' predicted, 'abnormal returns' are calculated for all days within the event window. These abnormal returns provide insights on (1) whether the event was of material relevance for the focal firm. (2) whether information about the event had leaked to the stock market and whether the market needed additional tune to absorb the informational content of the event. Post-Event Window The post event window is typically not considered. However, it may be used to investigate longer-term stock/company performance following the event.

At the same time, we are seeing alarming failures of corporate responsibility on the part of the largest Silicon Valley companies. What role do we in the academy have in fueling the crisis in Silicon Valley and what can we do about it?</p><p>Silicon Valley companies have allowed their platforms to be used for a range of troubling activities from child exploitation to child sex trade, revenge porn, radicalization and recruitment of extremists, fake news, trolling, bullying, and election tampering. Technology companies have cultivated and tolerated misogynistic work cultures. Until increasing public pressure forced them to relent, technology companies fought against the passage of sensible legislation, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, to make it possible for victims of sex trafficking to hold online enablers accountable. Facebook has enabled target advertising to self-identified \u201cJew haters\u201d and has allowed advertisers to illegally target housing ads to \u201cwhites only\u201d. Google recently admitted to tracking Android users even when users explicitly disabled location services. Twitter remains stubbornly oblivious to its platform being used for abuse, harassment, bullying, propaganda, and fake news. YouTube, until just a few months ago, has allowed videos of al-Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki to remain on its platform. And, adding to their growing bad behavior over the past few years, Uber recently admitted to concealing the theft of personal data from 57 million people.</p><p> The failures of Silicon Valley have become so alarming that the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate and House Intelligence Committees recently held several hearings where representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter were grilled on a variety of topics, from data privacy to election tampering. In January, the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing to specifically examine the problem of extremist propaganda on Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.</p><p> These concerns are not limited to the United States. Reeling from the third terrorist attack in three months in which terrorists were, in part, radicalized and recruited on-line, and citing the failures of Silicon Valley to rein in abuses on their platforms, British Prime Minister Theresa May recently called for regulatory legislation to prevent terror groups from continuing to weaponize the internet. Similarly frustrated by inaction in Silicon Valley, Germany passed a law imposing fines up to $59 million on sites that don\u2019t remove hate speech within 24 hours of notification. At the same time, the European Union has slapped Facebook with a $122 million fine for providing misleading statements during its acquisition of WhatsApp, Amazon with a $294 million fine for unpaid taxes, and Google with a record $2.7 billion antitrust fine.</p><p> It is the juxtaposition of Silicon Valley abuses and indifference and the funneling of students and faculty to Silicon Valley that should give academia pause. We are developing the latest technologies that are in turn being commercialized by Silicon Valley, many of us are working directly for or receiving funding from Silicon Valley, and we are directly or indirectly funneling our students to Silicon Valley.</p><p> Academics, therefore, hold some responsibility for the ultimate actions and failures of Silicon Valley.</p><p> As we ride the wave of enthusiasm for computer science, we should not overlook the broader impact that our own innovations and students are having on our society.</p><p> To this end, I suggest that we as educators (1) incorporate into our curricula ethics training in technology (as we do with bioethics) so that the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs are better prepared to tackle the complexities of ubiquitous technology in our lives and society; (2) provide more leadership in the private and public spheres on pressing issues, including privacy, the ethical use of artificial intelligence, and the abuse and harassment that is all too common on social media; (3) present to our students--particularly during campus recruiting events--a broad range of options for internships and post-graduation employment that go beyond Big Tech; and (4) provide on-campus resources to encourage entrepreneurship among our students and faculty with a focus on social entrepreneurship focused on solving pressing social, cultural, and environmental issues.</p><p> We should celebrate the growing interest in computer science.</p><p> Computing technology has and will continue to lead to insights and innovations across many disciplines.

At the same time, we are seeing alarming failures of corporate responsibility on the part of the largest Silicon Valley companies. What role do we in the academy have in fueling the crisis in Silicon Valley and what can we do about it?</p><p>Silicon Valley companies have allowed their platforms to be used for a range of troubling activities from child exploitation to child sex trade, revenge porn, radicalization and recruitment of extremists, fake news, trolling, bullying, and election tampering. Technology companies have cultivated and tolerated misogynistic work cultures. Until increasing public pressure forced them to relent, technology companies fought against the passage of sensible legislation, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, to make it possible for victims of sex trafficking to hold online enablers accountable. Facebook has enabled target advertising to self-identified \"Jew haters\" and has allowed advertisers to illegally target housing ads to \"whites only\". Google recently admitted to tracking Android users even when users explicitly disabled location services. Twitter remains stubbornly oblivious to its platform being used for abuse, harassment, bullying, propaganda, and fake news. YouTube, until just a few months ago, has allowed videos of al-Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki to remain on its platform. And, adding to their growing bad behavior over the past few years, Uber recently admitted to concealing the theft of personal data from 57 million people.</p><p>The failures of Silicon Valley have become so alarming that the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate and House Intelligence Committees recently held several hearings where representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter were grilled on a variety of topics, from data privacy to election tampering. In January, the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing to specifically examine the problem of extremist propaganda on Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>These concerns are not limited to the United States. Reeling from the third terrorist attack in three months in which terrorists were, in part, radicalized and recruited on-line, and citing the failures of Silicon Valley to rein in abuses on their platforms, British Prime Minister Theresa May recently called for regulatory legislation to prevent terror groups from continuing to weaponize the internet. Similarly frustrated by inaction in Silicon Valley, Germany passed a law imposing fines up to $59 million on sites that don't remove hate speech within 24 hours of notification. At the same time, the European Union has slapped Facebook with a $122 million fine for providing misleading statements during its acquisition of WhatsApp, Amazon with a $294 million fine for unpaid taxes, and Google with a record $2.7 billion antitrust fine.</p><p>It is the juxtaposition of Silicon Valley abuses and indifference and the funneling of students and faculty to Silicon Valley that should give academia pause. We are developing the latest technologies that are in turn being commercialized by Silicon Valley, many of us are working directly for or receiving funding from Silicon Valley, and we are directly or indirectly funneling our students to Silicon Valley.</p><p>Academics, therefore, hold some responsibility for the ultimate actions and failures of Silicon Valley.</p><p>As we ride the wave of enthusiasm for computer science, we should not overlook the broader impact that our own innovations and students are having on our society.</p><p>To this end, I suggest that we as educators (1) incorporate into our curricula ethics training in technology (as we do with bioethics) so that the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs are better prepared to tackle the complexities of ubiquitous technology in our lives and society; (2) provide more leadership in the private and public spheres on pressing issues, including privacy, the ethical use of artificial intelligence, and the abuse and harassment that is all too common on social media; (3) present to our students--particularly during campus recruiting events--a broad range of options for internships and post-graduation employment that go beyond Big Tech; and (4) provide on-campus resources to encourage entrepreneurship among our students and faculty with a focus on social entrepreneurship focused on solving pressing social, cultural, and environmental issues.</p><p>We should celebrate the growing interest in computer science.</p><p>Computing technology has and will continue to lead to insights and innovations across many disciplines. Studying computer science is vital to teaching strong analytical and critical reasoning skills.</p><p>At the same time, however, we in academia should think carefully about our role as individuals and educators in fueling what appears at times to be a morally bankrupt technology sector..</p><p>Dr. Hany Farid is the Albert Bradley 1915 Third Century Professor and Chair of Computer Science at Dartmouth College and a senior adviser to the Counter Extremism Project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UNIONL-352002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UNIONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKX-F1F1-JCBN-D0MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Union Leader Corp.

AFP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of us who live in Europe and the Americas are now marking six months since we started working from home to contain the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As if that weren't enough to confirm the unusual nature of 2020, we now know that the second quarter was the worst on record for US gross domestic product growth. Yet, even as that data came out, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices each set a new high, with the latter now up by around one-third year-to-date.</p><p>A new bout of volatility that began a couple of weeks ago has investors asking: Is the market going to reflect the ground reality or is the real world going to catch up with the market?</p><p>History might be cause for concern. September and October have tended to be the weakest months for US equities. Although November 1929 and April 1932 are the two worst months for the S&amp;P 500 since 1900, October has generally suffered the largest number of double-digit losses (in eight years out of 121). The average October return since 1900 has been -0.29 per cent. The worst days of the 2008 - 09 financial crisis, Black Monday of 1987 and the banking crisis of 1907 all fell in October.</p><p>While history isn't destiny, this autumn promises more than its fair share of hazards.</p><p>Read More</p><p>S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs as investors pump funds into tech stocks</p><p>What does the weaker US dollar mean for you?</p><p>Is it still possible to get a decent yield from dividends?</p><p>Even before the results of the US general elections are out, politics in the world's largest economy could unsettle markets. Facing a $1 trillion (Dh3.67tn) chasm in their negotiating positions, Democrats and Republicans may fail to deliver a new fiscal stimulus. Elsewhere, Japan is set for some leadership uncertainty after a long period of stability and progress under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe; while an October deadline looms for post-Brexit trade talks, currently snagged on the thorny issues of state aid, regulatory alignment and fishing rights.</p><p>Lest we forget, coronavirus is still with us. This summer, we have already seen a second wave of infections as lockdown restrictions were eased. But events like schools and universities reopening, more people returning to their workplaces, colder weather and, in the US, the interstate holiday travel associated with Thanksgiving and Christmas could all lead to a resurgence in new infections. At the same time, progress on vaccines and antiviral treatments provide upside for the economy and markets.</p><p>In addition to the health situation, as workers' furlough periods come to an end, the long-term impact of this crisis on the job market is becoming clear. Persistently high US initial jobless claims and recent consumer cutbacks on groceries and other essentials may be early signs of that.</p><p>With all of this to come, there may be little time to enjoy the fact that the S&amp;P 500 had its best August since 1984, finishing the month up 7 per cent. An autumnal chill may already have descended with the recent sharp sell-off.</p><p>A case can certainly be made for current index levels. Economies are poised to snap back hard once a vaccine is developed. Central banks look to be more accommodative for the longer term. A weaker dollar is also a tailwind, particularly to non-US markets.</p><p>The rally has been led by big technology names that offer exposure to long-term growth themes that, if anything, have been accelerated by the recent shift to working and shopping from home. Today's valuations are not at the irrational levels of the tech bubble 20 years ago: Microsoft may now trade at 32 times next year's earnings, but during 1999-2000 it had a multiple in the mid-60s. Cisco Systems, one of the high flyers back then, hit a high of almost 130 times its earnings.</p><p>Nonetheless, valuations in certain stocks\u2014often favourites among a new cohort of bullish retail investors\u2014do appear frothy. And while surveys of institutional investors indicate relatively conservative positioning in general, hedge fund strategies, in particular, look extended.</p><p>It is also worth recognising that big tech, which bore the brunt of the recent selling, is the new punching bag for both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. The chair of the US Congressional Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law has signalled that it will report its findings on the market dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google next month\u2014another addition to the list of stumbling blocks this autumn.</p><p>These stumbling blocks may be why, even as equities reach new highs, the CBOE volatility indices for both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have also been edging upward. Investors appear to be hedging for volatility over the coming weeks. It's going to be an eventful one.</p><p>Joe Amato is chief investment officer of equities at Neuberger Berman, a member of The Gulf Bond and Sukuk Association</p><p>Updated: September 21, 2020 05:10 PM</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/93/160075456123.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/93/160075456123.jpg</url></p><p>The recent rally has been led by big technology names that offer exposure to long-term growth themes.

AFP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of us who live in Europe and the Americas are now marking six months since we started working from home to contain the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As if that weren't enough to confirm the unusual nature of 2020, we now know that the second quarter was the worst on record for US gross domestic product growth. Yet, even as that data came out, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices each set a new high, with the latter now up by around one-third year-to-date.</p><p>A new bout of volatility that began a couple of weeks ago has investors asking: Is the market going to reflect the ground reality or is the real world going to catch up with the market?</p><p>History might be cause for concern. September and October have tended to be the weakest months for US equities. Although November 1929 and April 1932 are the two worst months for the S&amp;P 500 since 1900, October has generally suffered the largest number of double-digit losses (in eight years out of 121). The average October return since 1900 has been -0.29 per cent. The worst days of the 2008 - 09 financial crisis, Black Monday of 1987 and the banking crisis of 1907 all fell in October.</p><p>While history isn't destiny, this autumn promises more than its fair share of hazards.</p><p>Read More</p><p>S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs as investors pump funds into tech stocks</p><p>What does the weaker US dollar mean for you?</p><p>Is it still possible to get a decent yield from dividends?</p><p>Even before the results of the US general elections are out, politics in the world's largest economy could unsettle markets. Facing a $1 trillion (Dh3.67tn) chasm in their negotiating positions, Democrats and Republicans may fail to deliver a new fiscal stimulus. Elsewhere, Japan is set for some leadership uncertainty after a long period of stability and progress under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe; while an October deadline looms for post-Brexit trade talks, currently snagged on the thorny issues of state aid, regulatory alignment and fishing rights.</p><p>Lest we forget, coronavirus is still with us. This summer, we have already seen a second wave of infections as lockdown restrictions were eased. But events like schools and universities reopening, more people returning to their workplaces, colder weather and, in the US, the interstate holiday travel associated with Thanksgiving and Christmas could all lead to a resurgence in new infections. At the same time, progress on vaccines and antiviral treatments provide upside for the economy and markets.</p><p>In addition to the health situation, as workers' furlough periods come to an end, the long-term impact of this crisis on the job market is becoming clear. Persistently high US initial jobless claims and recent consumer cutbacks on groceries and other essentials may be early signs of that.</p><p>With all of this to come, there may be little time to enjoy the fact that the S&amp;P 500 had its best August since 1984, finishing the month up 7 per cent. An autumnal chill may already have descended with the recent sharp sell-off.</p><p>A case can certainly be made for current index levels. Economies are poised to snap back hard once a vaccine is developed. Central banks look to be more accommodative for the longer term. A weaker dollar is also a tailwind, particularly to non-US markets.</p><p>The rally has been led by big technology names that offer exposure to long-term growth themes that, if anything, have been accelerated by the recent shift to working and shopping from home. Today's valuations are not at the irrational levels of the tech bubble 20 years ago: Microsoft may now trade at 32 times next year's earnings, but during 1999-2000 it had a multiple in the mid-60s. Cisco Systems, one of the high flyers back then, hit a high of almost 130 times its earnings.</p><p>Nonetheless, valuations in certain stocks\u2014often favourites among a new cohort of bullish retail investors\u2014do appear frothy. And while surveys of institutional investors indicate relatively conservative positioning in general, hedge fund strategies, in particular, look extended.</p><p>It is also worth recognising that big tech, which bore the brunt of the recent selling, is the new punching bag for both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. The chair of the US Congressional Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law has signalled that it will report its findings on the market dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google next month\u2014another addition to the list of stumbling blocks this autumn.</p><p>These stumbling blocks may be why, even as equities reach new highs, the CBOE volatility indices for both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have also been edging upward. Investors appear to be hedging for volatility over the coming weeks. It's going to be an eventful one.</p><p>Joe Amato is chief investment officer of equities at Neuberger Berman, a member of The Gulf Bond and Sukuk Association</p><p>Updated: September 22, 2020 09:03 AM</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/93/160076180610.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/93/160076180610.jpg</url></p><p>The recent rally has been led by big technology names that offer exposure to long-term growth themes.

In fact, the latest edition of PYMNT...</p><p>In less than a decade, voice-activated artificial intelligence (AI) assistants like Alexa and Siri have gone from something seen in science-fiction films to mainstream consumer touchpoints for larger digital ecosystems. In fact, the latest edition of PYMNTS\u2019 and Visa\u2019s  How We Will Pay survey  found that more than three in 10 consumers own voice assistants, compared to just 1.4 out of 10 in 2017.   And although consumers are still most likely to use those devices to do things like check the weather, play music or search for recipes, they\u2019re increasingly pivoting toward using the systems for commerce . Our latest survey observed a 25 percent increase in the portion of consumers making purchases via AI-enabled speakers. That rose to 9.6 percent of all consumers as of late in 2019, versus just 7.7 percent a year earlier.   All of that sounds promising for the future of voice as the next great channel for connected commerce \u2013 and promising as well for voice device providers like Apple, Amazon and Google looking to expand their footprints.   In fact, European Union regulators see it as perhaps  too  good of an opportunity.  Bloomberg  this week reported that the EU is including voice assistants and their power to drive commerce as one of several issues in a \u201csweeping\u201d new antitrust probe that the body has launched against tech giants.   \u201cOnce big companies use their power, they can very, very quickly push markets beyond the tipping point where competition turns into monopoly,\u201d EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told reporters, according to Bloomberg. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act in good time, there is a serious risk that this will happen again with the Internet of Things.\u201d   Voice assistants have apparently captured so much regulatory interest because of the power they take on as a commerce intermediary that can change how consumers interact with potential products. While consumers in a brick-and-mortar store would see everything available to them on a shelf, voice assistants could display only what Siri, Alexa or the Google Assistant elects to show them.   The EU\u2019s concerns are apparently two-fold. First, regulators want to know about all of the highly useful consumer data that tech firms gather via smart devices \u2013 and whether that gives companies unfair advantages over competitors.   A second worry is the potential for Big Tech to use voice-enabled ecosystems to unfairly lock out competitors. For instance, Bloomberg noted that companies could program smart speakers to push all requests to buy products to a single shopping site like Amazon , bypassing all competing offers.   The EU is seeking information from some 400 global organizations, with a preliminary report scheduled for next spring and a final conclusion to be published in summer 2021, Bloomberg said.   The probe will reportedly cover not only devices like smart speakers, but also things like connected refrigerators and smart TVs. Connected cars will likely be subject to a separate review.   Vestager said the goal is to prevent private voice ecosystems from hijacking the market. \u201cWe see interoperability is of the essence if this market is to remain open and contestable,\u201d Vestager told reporters.   She said regulators will probe companies \u201cin all of these value chains \u2013 those who make the most assistants, those who make devices, those who make digital services, but also standard-setters\u201d who determine industry benchmarks.   The probe comes at a time when Big Tech is pushing to create interoperable standards for smart homes. Players are trying to promote the adoption of a new royalty-free connectivity standard to make smart-home products more compatible and secure.   The  project  includes Amazon, Google, Apple and the Zigbee Alliance, which includes firms like IKWA, Samsung SmartThings and Silicon Labs. It aims to build a new open-source effort for smart-home tech to foster the implementation of a unified protocol.   \u201cThe decision to leverage these technologies is expected to accelerate the development of the protocol and deliver benefits to manufacturers and consumers faster,\u201d the group said in  announcing the effort .   Such collaboration might be in the future of voice commerce if Big Tech can convince EU regulators that it\u2019s not designed to trap consumers in a single ecosystem. But as our How We Will Pay survey shows, voice is already quickly developing into a new consumer-commerce channel.   Given how people are increasing their online shopping due to COVID-19 , one might expect adoption rates to climb even higher when we study the subject again later this year. But adoption is already large enough to have earned some antitrust heat \u2013 which means we might see more attempts by Big Tech to look passionately collaborative instead of cutthroat competitive.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    New PYMNTS Study: Subscription Commerce Conversion Index \u2013 July 2020     Staying home 24/7 has consumers turning to subscription services for both entertainment and their day-to-day needs. While that\u2019s a great opportunity for providers, it also presents a challenge \u2014 27.4 million consumers are looking to cancel their subscriptions because of friction and cost concerns. In the latest Subscription Commerce Conversion Index , PYMNTS reveals the five key features that can help companies keep subscribers loyal despite today\u2019s challenging economic times.

Platform power inheres in companies of economic scale that provide the terms of access through which large numbers of consumers access goods, services, and information. Firms with platform power benefit from a deference from policymakers, but this deference is not primarily a function of direct influence through lobbying or campaign contributions, nor does it come from the threat of disinvestment. Companies with platform power instead benefit from the tacit allegiance of consumers, who can prove a formidable source of opposition to regulations that threaten these platforms.

Yet, corporate power is clearly a different animal than it used to be (Davis, 2015), and political science has been slow to catch on to this transformation. Today, a handful of big technology companies\u2014Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft\u2014exercise enormous influence in the advanced economies (Moore &amp; Tambini, 2018), at the same moment that the organized business elite in many countries, including the United States, has ceased to project a united political voice (Heemskerk, 2007; Mizruchi, 2013). An effective conception of the political power of business needs to be capable of understanding the variation in power held by individual firms, and not just the power of organized business as a collective body (Culpepper, 2015). This is not merely a difference in the interests of large and small companies, which has a long history in political economy. It is a recognition that a few individual players have an economic\u2014and potentially a political\u2014impact that past work on business power does not immediately illuminate, because in the ontology of much of political science, business is an interest group (Vogel, 1987). Yet in fact, firms in the singular form are now influential players in the economy and in politics (Collier, Dubal, &amp; Carter, 2018).</p><p/><p>In this article, we investigate the political power of a number of technology companies that play the role of central intermediaries in the economies of the advanced industrial democracies\u2014platform firms. In contrast to traditional business models based on selling goods or services, platform companies represent a new means to create and capture value through their capacity to harvest and harness immense amounts of data in ways that allow them to operate as critical market makers (Srnicek, 2016; Zysman &amp; Kenney, 2017). Thus, service platforms such as Uber or Airbnb connect seekers with providers of services, goods platforms like Amazon connect buyers with sellers, and information platforms like Facebook and Google connect people to each other, to advertisers, and to information. Sabeel Rahman (2018) has succinctly summarized the central role these firms play in the economic infrastructure of 21st century capitalism: \u201cWhether it is Google\u2019s dominance of search and online information, Facebook\u2019s centrality for access to media, or Amazon\u2019s growing control over . . . distribution networks for physical goods,\u201d these firms exercise broad control over the terms of access to crucial services on which a wide range of other actors depend (p. 149).</p><p>Not all, and indeed very few, firms achieve this level of influence, but those that do clearly play an outsized role in modern life. The question is, do they play an outsized role in political life\u2014and if so, how? We argue that platform firms that achieve a certain economic scale\u2014which need not reach monopoly proportions\u2014benefit from the direct relationship they enjoy to a large number of consumers who rely on the platform as it becomes integrated into the fabric of their daily lives. Unlike previous generations of large companies on which the broader economy came to depend, such as railways or utility companies, today\u2019s largest platforms enjoy a tight, even intimate, connection to their users. Not all platform companies reach either the economic scale or the infrastructural capacity to build consumer attachment and consumer dependence. But for those that do achieve such scale and influence, the direct connection to the consumer confers a distinctive form of power. We therefore call this quantity platform power.</p><p>The classic tools of regulatory capture and the threat of disinvestment\u2014sometimes known as the instrumental and structural power of business, respectively\u2014do not capture the type of political influence today\u2019s dominant platform firms wield in modern capitalism. Just as not all businesses enjoy business power, not all platform companies benefit from platform power. For those that achieve dominance in a particular market, however, the political influence these companies wield is not merely a function of their size and scale. It is at this point that the study of the political power of platform firms makes a novel contribution to the literature on business influence. Market power is a necessary but not sufficient condition for platform power. The mechanism that translates market power into political clout, we argue, flows from the appreciation, verging on dependence, that consumers have for the convenience these companies provide. Because they are connected to these platforms by their smartphones, they are always only a click away from a cheap ride or a free piece of information or a swift delivery of a consumer good. Dominant platform firms cultivate and benefit from a privileged alliance with consumers, who buttress platform power by providing a formidable source of opposition to regulation that threatens the convenience provided by these platforms.</p><p>Large platform companies do not always get their way, any more than other companies that benefit from structural power always get their way in politics. Understanding their power is critical to understanding the strategies they pursue and the political challenges they face. Focusing on the role played by consumers in explaining the powers these firms wield also provides insights into their distinctive vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities flow from events that split the consumer\u2013platform alliance or that cue citizen, as opposed to consumer, political identities. Thus, political issues that highlight the ways in which the interests of consumers and those of the company diverge can disrupt the alliance. Furthermore, so long as platform users think of themselves as consumers rather than citizens, these companies have a strong ally in public opinion, which values the convenience and innovation capacity of the platforms more than it trusts the heavy regulatory hand of government. However, the deep involvement of the platforms in the modern economy means that their algorithms can change the outcomes of elections and their privacy policies can enable them to know far more about us than governments do. When such considerations become politically salient, as Facebook has discovered recently, they prime citizen identities, leaving the public much more amenable to imposing regulation on platforms.</p><p>Our enterprise in this article is primarily conceptual\u2014developing a way of understanding an emergent source of business power that challenges current ways of thinking. In the next section, we explore the particular features of platform firms that make them unusual, and we identify consumers and their alliance with the large platforms as the element missing in the conventional toolbox of political economists trying to understand business power. The following two sections outline how the priming of the consumer identity can most productively be understood by analogy to the idea of the permissive consensus (Hooghe &amp; Marks, 2009), which helps generate hypotheses about the course of political conflicts involving platform firms. Empirically, we apply this conceptual apparatus to a range of recent, high-profile cases in which platform companies were political protagonists. Putting the consumer\u2013platform alliance in the analytical foreground helps to explain variations in the political strategies and observed political effectiveness of platform companies around the world. The final section concludes the article.</p><h>Platform Companies and Business Power</h><p>Social scientists have recently turned their attention back to classic questions of business influence in democratic politics, prompted by a combination of skyrocketing inequality and the increasing attention to the one-percent and moneyed interests in politics. Marxist scholars built some of the scaffolding for these modern debates by distinguishing between the instrumental and the structural power of business (e.g., Block, 1980; Miliband, 1969; Poulantzas, 1973). Within political science, early formulations of business power stressed direct forms of influence through iron triangles and the \u201cpower elite\u201d (e.g., Mills, 1956). Subsequent work by scholars such as Lindblom (1977) and Gaventa (1980) explored subtler but still potent forms of business power in politics and political economy.</p><p>Recent scholarship has brought new insights into how business power in both its instrumental and structural variants is manifested and exercised in contemporary capitalism. With respect to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">instrumental power</emphasis>, we have come a great distance in refining early characterizations suggesting influence through outright bribery, corruption, and backroom deals. We now understand more about the wide range of resources, made possible and amplified by financial resources but reaching far beyond these, that allow economic interests to influence political outcomes. For example, Hacker and Pierson\u2019s (2017) analysis of the American Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce explored the organizational resources that business interests use to influence policy directly. Alexander Hertel-Fernandez\u2019s (2014) study of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) illuminated the informational resources that business interests offer to influence state legislators. The work of Hertel-Fernandez, Mildenberger, and Stokes (2019) showed how corporate interests exercise especial influence on the way congressional staffers estimate public opinion in their own districts. Culpepper\u2019s (2011) research on quiet politics demonstrated the importance of the informational advantages of business in lobbying legislatures and influencing media coverage. These and other recent works have given us new insights into the sources and nature of the instrumental power exercised by business in politics (Pagliari &amp; Young, 2015; Woll, 2008; Young, 2012).</p><p>Recent work on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">structural power of business</emphasis> has similarly advanced in comparison with early formulations, providing a nuanced response to the criticism of pluralists like David Vogel (1987), who found the concept of structural power wanting for lack of evidence that business always and everywhere got what it wanted. Classic structural power arguments emphasized how business power operates in the minds of politicians in an anticipatory way. Specifically, politicians forebear in the face of the threat of business exit or disinvestment, worried about what Lindblom called the \u201cpunishing recoil mechanism\u201d\u2014as firms leave for more favorable business locations or invest less money, thus depressing growth and employment (Lindblom, 1982; Przeworski &amp; Wallerstein, 1988). In the meantime, however, the literature has moved beyond the idea of power as a fixed attribute of the business class in advanced capitalism and embraced a more relational view\u2014a situation of \u201cmutual dependency\u201d between governments and business, sometimes but not always asymmetrically skewed toward business (Culpepper, 2015, p. 398). Armed with a more nuanced understanding of the nature of structural power, recent literature has made clear that the structural power of business is something that varies\u2014over time (Hacker &amp; Pierson, 2002), cross-nationally (Culpepper &amp; Reinke, 2014; Fairfield, 2015; Grossman &amp; Woll, 2014; Woll, 2014), and even across different firms (Culpepper, 2015; Young, 2015).1</p><p>Despite these clear advances in understanding, traditional notions of instrumental and structural power seem challenged by the prominent role of Facebook and Amazon in the modern political economy. Clearly, such firms possess tremendous financial resources and have active lobbies in Washington, Brussels, and other political capitals around the world. In the United States in 2017, companies in the Internet sector spent $50 million on lobbying, a threefold increase since 2009 (\u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d 2018); Amazon alone increased its spending on American lobbying to roughly $13 million in 2017, as opposed to equivalent spending of $2.5 million 5 years earlier (Lynch, 2017). Tech companies and their employees are large sources of campaign finance in the United States, giving three-quarters of their donations to Democrats. They have been similarly active in the European Union (EU), deploying instrumental power when regulatory issues affecting them come before the European Commission (Corporate Europe Observatory [CEO], 2018), the European Council (Cadwalladr &amp; Campbell, 2019), and the European Parliament (Rossi, 2016).</p><p>However, it is not at all clear that the tools and strategies of instrumental power represent the principal form of influence these companies wield. Their political strength does not flow uniquely from the amount they spend on lobbying, but in the way that the political terrain they enter is already tilted in their favor. Who wants to be the politician who shuts down my access to cheap consumer goods delivered the next day through Amazon Prime or the information gateway that connects me to the world through Facebook?</p><p>Intuitively, the power of these companies shares some similarities to older conceptions of structural power. In this case too, the form of influence companies exercise flows from the normal operation of the firm, not from something done as a sideline to their business to influence politics. In common with Lindblom\u2019s (1982) punishing recoil mechanism, platform power is largely automatic\u2014it happens in the minds of politicians. The difference, though, is that in the case of platform power, the potential loss is not disinvestment or job loss. Amazon is a large employer, and its hunt for a new headquarters kicked off jurisdictional competition across American cities. But Google and Facebook employ relatively few people, and no one thinks that these firms are going to stop investing in the promotion of their platforms if regulation goes against them. The power these companies wield operates not through politician\u2019s fear of the pain that these firms can visit upon the economy so much as the anticipated political fallout to which overeager regulators would expose themselves by messing with the infrastructure of people\u2019s lives.</p><p>Legal scholars have been quicker than political scientists to consider the challenges that platform companies pose to regulation, focusing especially on issues of market or monopoly power (e.g., Cohen, 2016; Lynskey, 2017). The outsized power wielded by some platform companies in contemporary capitalism has inspired analogies to the great monopolies of yesteryear, companies such as Standard Oil and U.S. Steel (Posner &amp; Weyl, 2018; Rahman, 2018). What these analogies capture well is that, like the railroads of the 19th century, companies such as Google and Amazon are not just service providers in their own right. They also provide the infrastructure to which an entire economic ecosystem\u2014consisting of myriad other businesses\u2014is now attached (Rahman, 2018). Third-party sellers are in the meantime almost entirely reliant on Amazon (or Google shopping) to reach consumers; content creators need YouTube to monetize their videos. In this sense, traditional measures of a firm\u2019s \u201csize\u201d often understate platform dominance. Amazon, for example, commands a large share of the online retail market, but more importantly, it occupies a structural position that enables it to control market flows in both directions (for an extended analysis, see Rahman &amp; Thelen, 2019).</p><p>We do not contest the importance of the monopoly power enjoyed by some of these firms, and we note that the dominant market position many of them currently occupy is a direct function of the way in which creative entrepreneurs got out ahead of regulators to create and cultivate new markets and grow to scale before policymakers had regulated these spaces (Thelen, 2018). Just as increasing returns solidify market concentration for classical monopolies, platforms that achieve scale can exploit their competitive advantage to fend off rivals and defend their dominance. Indeed, given the centrality of network effects to the success of these companies, scale is critical to their ability \u201cto cultivate and capture value\u201d (Langley &amp; Leyshon, 2017, p. 22). As Kurz notes, the data they collect on users are a core strategic asset, so that \u201conce an innovative firm establishes platform dominance . . . cost and economies-of-scale advantages are almost impossible for competitors to overcome\u201d (Kurz, 2017).</p><p>What is different and politically consequential, however, is that unlike the monopolies of the past, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">today\u2019s tech firms enjoy a direct, indeed virtually unmediated, link to their users, most of whom connect to these firms through devices they carry in their pockets every day</emphasis>. Companies with platform power have achieved economic scale on the back of a hand-in-glove relationship with these users. The most successful such firms have proved to be extraordinarily adept in leveraging their loyal (in many cases, effectively captive) consumer base into an active public narrative and political advocacy strategy to secure legislative and legal support for their business model. Legal approaches that stress monopoly control alone, just as instrumental and structural power approaches, assume that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">economic incentives</emphasis> are foremost in the minds of policymakers who are considering adopting regulations that constrain business. As such, all these previous formulations miss a critical new source of business power that stems from the connection that today\u2019s platforms have forged, and actively cultivate, with consumers whom politicians and regulators are reluctant to antagonize.</p><h>Consumers and Platform Power</h><p>With few exceptions (Naoi &amp; Kume, 2015; Rahman &amp; Thelen, 2019; Rogowski &amp; Kayser, 2002; Trumbull, 2006), consumers are undertheorized in the literature on the political economy of the rich democracies. This may have been understandable in the era of manufacturing dominance, but it is increasingly untenable in modern service-based economies in which consumers are clearly pivotal. Understanding the role of consumers in shoring up today\u2019s platform firms helps to make clear what distinguishes platform power from other forms of business power.</p><p>Consumers are by definition important to any capitalist enterprise, but the relationship to today\u2019s dominant platforms goes beyond familiar models of consumer loyalty or cost-based choice. Target and Walmart and Nike appeal to their consumers on price or on brand, and companies like Lego and Ikea are wildly popular with consumers. But the relationship of consumers to firms like Amazon and Uber runs much deeper, as these platforms over time have come to form part of the infrastructure of their lives. For those platforms that achieve scale, consumers can become essentially locked in, and the power these firms wield takes on \u201csecond face of power\u201d characteristics (Lukes, 2005). The political terrain comes to be tilted in favor of the platform, and politicians rationally shy away from even entertaining policies that would deprive their constituencies of the conveniences on which many of them now rely.</p><p>Business power is classically seen as exercised against the public interest, and in fact the litmus test for structural power has often required the analyst first to demonstrate that what business wants \u201cpushes against substantial opposition in government or in public opinion\u201d (Culpepper, 2015, p. 397). By such a standard, however, today\u2019s platform firms mostly fail the test. To the extent that Google delivers superior (faster and better) search results, and to the extent that Amazon makes shopping easier and less expensive, the power of these companies (in the short-run anyway) is clearly exercised not <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">against</emphasis> the public but in a close and symbiotic alliance with a public that has come to depend on them. This allows platform firms to portray themselves as promoting the interest of consumers in efficiency, innovation, and choice. This is power that is exercised not against but often decidedly <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">with</emphasis> a public that enjoys the fruits of innovation. In this sense, platform firms have succeeded in getting what they want because the public wants it too.</p><p>These features also distinguish today\u2019s platforms sharply from traditional monopolies. Platform firms share with contemporary (publicly regulated) natural monopolies, such as electricity companies, scale advantages that allow them to provide goods at a cheaper cost. We are all dependent on access to the electric grid, and it is certainly convenient to have the lights stay on and keep my iPhone charged. The risk is that with such market dominance, natural monopolies can raise prices on consumers, who would then not have alternatives, and would be forced to pay monopoly rents. Being plugged into the electricity grid, I qua consumer am dependent on a power supplier, and I want the state to check that power. That sort of dependence creates a potential for a politician\u2013consumer alliance in favor of regulatory politics.</p><p>Like natural monopolies, the efficiency gains of today\u2019s tech platforms are above all a matter of their massive scale and scope. Very differently, however, from most public monopolies, these platforms (at least at this stage in their development) feel to the consumer like liberation from market distortions that keep them from getting the lowest price for a ride (Uber) or prevent them from finding publicly available information (Google).2 Being plugged into the Internet market via Amazon, I qua consumer am liberated from the need to go to brick and mortar stores. This creates hostility to state regulation that threatens to take away the advantages brought to me by my preferred platforms. Who loves their electricity company? No one. That is not the case with companies that exercise platform power, and this situation creates a bias in favor of deregulatory politics, where consumers and the dominant companies are on the same side\u2014against state intervention.</p><p>In short, platform firms share with popular companies such as Lego a strong and loyal customer base and with classic monopolies such as U.S. Steel size and scale advantages that give them a massive edge over competitors. What is distinctive and distinctively powerful, however, is the combination of these features. To put it somewhat crudely: consumers depended on U.S. Steel, which exercised infrastructural power, but they did not love the company or actively appreciate the advantages (if any) that it afforded them. By contrast, consumers love Lego but they are not dependent on the company in the same way that they are dependent on, say, Amazon, which actually allows them to order their Legos without having to change out of their pajamas. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">platform</emphasis> in platform power thereby does important work for these companies.</p><p>Our treatment of consumer preferences for regulation is admittedly somewhat stylized: if a regulation does good for consumers without having any effect on their ability to enjoy the convenience delivered by platform innovation, there is in theory no reason consumers should oppose regulation.3 As long they do not effectively shut down a platform, regulations that, for example, attempt to enhance competition or to give consumers control of how their data are used could be welcomed by consumers. Research does suggest some limitations to these conjectures, however. First, there is large body of research on the privacy paradox, some of which establishes that consumers may claim in surveys to like privacy but will in their actual behavior sacrifice it in exchange for modestly lower prices or greater convenience (see Kokolakis, 2017 for a review). Second, different individuals hold distinct preferences with respect to the costs and benefits of various forms of regulation, as for example young UberPool users with limited resources may be warier of regulations that could raise prices than their UberBlack-client elders. Or, as argued by Strahilevitz (2013), consumers who are less concerned about privacy issues may be aligned, if only by default, with companies who oppose strict data protection regulation.4 And, finally, as we will discuss below, consumers in at least some national markets trust businesses to self-regulate more than they trust governments to regulate. Each of these reasons suggests that our simplifying assumption of a significant level of general consumer aversion to regulation of innovative platform companies, absent the sort of citizen priming we introduce below, is consistent with observed patterns of consumer behavior in this rapidly evolving policy domain.</p><p>Consumers\u2019 high regard for today\u2019s dominant platforms\u2014and their appreciation of the astonishing benefits they deliver through our cell phones\u2014is evident in global indices of company popularity. In the 2018 global brand health rankings created by the polling firm YouGov, platform companies took five of the top six places (Table 1).</p><h>Table 1.</h><p>YouGov\u2019s Global Health Brand Rankings 2018.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1 Google</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6 Amazon</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2 YouTube</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7 Ikea</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">3 Samsung</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">8 Colgate</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">4 WhatsApp</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">9 Uniqlo</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">5 Facebook</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10 Lego</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Source.</emphasis>YouGov BrandIndex ().

The Edelman Trust Barometer compiles globally comparable data on trends in the trustworthiness of various industries.

In a survey fielded in early 2018, the Pew Research Center probed American preferences on how to police the dissemination of fake news on social media. Against the backdrop of a national discussion of the role of fake news in the 2016 American presidential election, the survey asked a nationally representative sample of American adults who\u2014tech firms or government\u2014should regulate the dissemination of false information online? The results pointed to a striking preference on the part of citizens for self-regulation through the tech companies rather than government regulation of fake news.</p><p>As shown in Table 3, only 39% of Americans thought the U.S. government should restrict the flow of false information online, while in response to otherwise identical question wording, 56% of Americans thought technology companies should perform these functions. And this finding came <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">in the wake</emphasis> of a scandal in which technology companies were the critical channels through which false information flowed into a presidential campaign. Although we lack the data to know whether this specific impulse exists in public opinion outside the United States, the general popularity and trust of consumers for technology companies that we have documented in this section is an international phenomenon, one that serves the political interests of large platform firms in a variety of countries around the world.</p><h>Table 3.</h><p>Government Regulation or Company Regulation of Fake News?

Our theoretical position draws on the priming literature in social science, which posits that individuals have multiple identities, the salience of which can influence their political preferences on a given political issue. Most notably, we are all citizens and consumers. Priming citizen identity can lead to more sociotropic preferences, while priming consumer identity can lead to a narrower focus on individual self-interest.</p><p>Empirical support for this proposition can be found in the area of international trade preferences, where Naoi and Kume (2015) show that the priming of consumer identities in Japan raised support for free trade by up to 9% compared with a control group. This insight builds on the work of Baker (2003, 2005), who argued that consumer preferences explain some part of the cross-country variation in policies for trade liberalization. It can also be found in the field of psychology, where experimental research has shown that cuing consumer identity, as opposed to \u201ccitizen\u201d or \u201cindividual\u201d identities, increases materialistic aspirations and decreases levels of social trust and feelings of responsibility in common pool resource dilemmas (Bauer, Wilkie, Kim, &amp; Bodenhausen, 2012).</p><p>Capital and labor platforms are directly oriented to the consumption of goods and services. Information platforms such as Google work on the premise of targeted advertising, exposure to which can readily cue consumer identity. So long as their alliance with consumers lasts, the tacit support of consumers is a powerful source of advantage for platform companies. But when publics turn against them, these firms are vulnerable. To sharpen our expectations about why platform power varies, we need a conceptual apparatus that allows us to understand the sources and limits of consumer support for platform firms. When does the consumer identity dominate preference formation, and when is it subordinated to citizen or other aspects of identity?</p><p>The orientation of today\u2019s consumers with respect to companies enjoying platform power can perhaps best be made by analogy to what Hooghe and Marks (2009) called the permissive consensus in public opinion. The permissive consensus held that public opinion across member states of the EU was broadly positive toward the European project, and that this positive orientation gave political leaders some freedom to craft new institutional deals about the evolution of the EU. This expansive attitude lasted only so long as the EU was not perceived by citizens to intrude on the core issues of political difference that structured national political competition (Scharpf, 1999). The permissive consensus was seen to have died in the wake of the Maastricht Treaty, which set up the process for adopting the single currency that became the euro. This policy development brought the institutional evolution of the EU into the realm of redistributive political questions: the ability to conduct one\u2019s own monetary policy and the limits of permissible public spending and borrowing. These issues were at the core of national differences among member states, and the political salience of the European dimension of politics thus became much more intense. The public began to think of the EU not as a simple broadening of the market that brought them cheaper goods, but as a constraint on the ability of national governments to deliver the public policies demanded by their populations.</p><p>The permissive consensus usefully reminds us that the support of consumers may be drained away when the politics of an issue intersects with the core concerns of people as citizens rather than as consumers. So long as the consensus holds, consumers enjoy the free lunch delivered by radical technological innovation. Their political orientation in such situations is likely to be a permissive one, which favors the assumption of company freedom to promote innovation. At the same time, however, consumers are not (always) fools. They are at least aware that big companies do not always have their interests at heart.</p><p>We expect a breakdown of the new permissive consensus in two sorts of situations. The first is one in which a political issue becomes framed in ways that directly pit the interests of the consumer against the interests of the platform companies. The second situation in which the permissive consensus will collapse is one in which political events prime consumers to think of themselves as citizens first, with the sociotropic concerns of citizens, as opposed to consumers first. The latter situation may not involve interest conflict between consumers and platforms so much as interest conflict between citizens and platforms\u2014and all consumers also have a citizen identity, no matter how much time they spend online.</p><p>Conceiving of consumer support as a new permissive consensus allows us to generate empirical expectations about the political strategies of platform firms and the conditions under which they succeed and fail. Platforms such as Google and Facebook, which exchange access to information for the data of users, have created and now dominate new markets and services. Once these firms reach scale, it is not so much consumer loyalty that inspires the coalition between users and platform as consumer dependence. The dependence is in some sense mutual, in that these information platforms depend on the consumer\u2019s willingness to trade their data in return for free use of the platforms and the convenience the platform provides. The key to making this deal sustainable is to have brands that consumers have no reason to mistrust\u2014in other words, when Google says \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d is its motto, that consumers believe it. When they do lose consumer trust\u2014even if they maintain near-monopoly power in a market\u2014we expect a rapid loss of political capital. And when the only thing keeping regulators from imposing new rules is the fear of consumer backlash that translates into this empirical expectation: platform companies that suffer substantial losses of consumer confidence are likely to suffer regulatory losses, regardless of whether their share price or market share is affected.</p><p>Where platforms can plausibly present themselves as representing consumer interests\u2014for example, as champions of choice and innovation fighting against over-regulation\u2014elected politicians have reason to tread carefully in making laws that affect platform companies. Other things being equal, we therefore expect platform companies to regard appeals to the broader public to be much more attractive than they typically are for non-platform companies. Consumers as a group are often organized into politics with associational structures or legal protections that see them as having conflicting interests to business (Trumbull, 2006). Consumer protection law is after all based on the principle of protecting consumers from someone, and that someone is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">business</emphasis>. But with carefully cultivated reputations for competence and deep ties to the consumers who depend on their services, platform companies often think they are likely to benefit from including the consumer viewpoint.</p><p>This claim has implications for the ways in which we expect platform companies to engage in politics. According to this logic, platform companies are more likely than non-platform companies to engage in broad-based political campaigns, pitting their popularity against those of their opponents. It is worth underlining that this is a radical departure from the standard operating procedure of big business, as well as from the expectations of the literature on regulatory capture. Business typically prefers to deal with regulators or courts rather than with legislatures as a venue for action (D\u00fcr, Bernhagen, &amp; Marshall, 2015). Regulators put a premium on expert knowledge of the subject and carefully crafted argument, while legislatures are considered more volatile and thus less reliably pro-business. Representatives of business have traditionally engaged in forum-shopping, to find the arena in which the tools of quiet politics are most effective. The preferred arena of conflict for business is typically a regulatory conference room rather than a public parliamentary hearing (Culpepper, 2011).</p><p>Platform companies are as likely to forum-shop as any other business, but they sometimes have good reason to prefer incorporating the public\u2014and the legislative actors likely to be moved by public opinion\u2014even as they try to influence public views on quickly changing questions of policy. Where independent bureaucratic agencies or courts regulate platforms, those bodies are by design more politically insulated from popular influence. We expect this insulation to diminish the influence of platform power in front of regulators such as the European Competition Network. Where issues are in the courts or with regulators, we may nevertheless expect to see platform companies draw in the public to try leverage the consumer alliance as a weapon in their favor.</p><h>Platform Power in Practice</h><p>The recency of the rise of platform power as a phenomenon limits our ability to test these propositions systematically. There are a number of politically important and geographically diverse instances of political contestation involving platform firms, and we draw on these in this section to illustrate the productive application of platform power to this emerging field of politics. In the first part of this section, we examine temporal and spatial variation in the success of platform power, depending on the way in which public debates highlighted the convergence or divergence of interests between platforms and their users. In the second part, we show how platforms try to capitalize on their popularity with consumers to achieve political goals. And in the final part of this section, we examine the strategies of one influential platform company to address a misalignment between its consumer base and the seat of political authority, which the company recognized and sought to change to its advantage.</p><h>Alignment of Consumer and Platform Interests as a Variable</h><p>Platform companies are as vulnerable as any other company to events that show them in a bad light with the public. But the nature of their vulnerability has distinctive characteristics, tied to the ways in which the salience of some issues undermines the alignment of interests between consumers and platforms or prime citizen identities as opposed to consumer identities. Issues that put the consumer and the platform on the same side will have trouble gaining traction in the public eye. For example, Amazon\u2019s Prime delivery service is predicated on harsh labor practices that allow the company to deliver goods more quickly and cheaply than ever before. However, taking a hard look at what makes it possible for the company to fulfill our shopping needs so swiftly and inexpensively would require consumers to share blame in the exploitation these practices entail. Consumers are unlikely to mobilize around this issue since they themselves are complicit in it. To update the famous observation of Upton Sinclair, it is difficult to get a person to understand something when the cheapness of their goods and services depends on their not understanding it.</p><p>Other issues, however, directly undermine the perception of the platform company and its consumers as notional allies. For example, in the case of information platforms that trade data for services, scandals that focus attention on what is happening with individual data are particularly damaging because they activate privacy concerns and alert consumers to the reality that the information they are getting in fact comes at a cost. One early and notable instance of this political dynamic took place in the EU in the wake of the 2013 revelation of Edward Snowden about data collection practices of the U.S. government.5 At the time, the European Parliament was already well advanced in developing draft legislation to govern privacy, the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Before the bombshell dropped by Snowden\u2019s release of information on how data were being collected, the GDPR had attracted sustained lobbying from private companies but very little public attention. However, as Figure 1 illustrates, the Snowden affair immediately raised the public profile of the GDPR discussion, and it did so in a way that put platforms on the same side as government intelligence agencies, and on the opposite side of European private citizens who used the Internet (Rossi, 2016).</p><h>Figure 1.</h><p>Salience of Internet privacy and Snowden revelations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Source.</emphasis> Rossi (2016, p. 31). Data are from Lexis Nexis for the largest two newspapers in each of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>The Snowden episode revealed that platform companies were the key vector through which the American and British intelligence agencies had been gathering data, directly from the servers of \u201cMicrosoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, [and] Apple\u201d (Gellman &amp; Poitras, 2013). As Rossi (2016) in particular has shown, these events caused a stark reversal in how consumers perceived the major platform companies, which were no longer viewed as benign resources for sharing information but as active collaborators in the project of government surveillance (see also Ash, 2013; Packer, 2013). That is, the Snowden revelations drove a wedge into the alliance between platforms and consumers by revealing to consumers that there was a hidden cost of their reliance on information platforms. The ensuing public outrage contributed to a significant strengthening of the GDPR (Rossi, 2016).</p><p>The more recent Facebook scandal brought the same issue home to American consumers. Facebook was scraping private data all along, completely under the radar until Cambridge Analytica brought high salience to privacy issues, and in a way that made consumers worldwide ask what Facebook was doing with their data. Suddenly the company became politically vulnerable, as evidenced by the copious portions of humble pie consumed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the wake of the news about Cambridge Analytica. One poll of American adults, taken just after outbreak of the scandal in early 2018, showed that 56% of people named Facebook as the tech company they trusted least; the next least trusted was Google, with 5%.6 A poll commissioned by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fortune</emphasis> in October 2018 showed that Facebook remained the company least trusted by consumers with their personal data, with only 22% expressing a lot or a fair amount of trust in the company (Amazon led the poll, with 49% expressing a lot or a fair amount of trust).7 Although it is too early to assess the full political fallout of the Facebook scandal, one early result was a sweeping new online privacy law in the company\u2019s home state of California, a law that sailed through the state legislature (\u201cfrom draft to law in one week\u201d) with strong bipartisan support.8 In this case as well, we would argue, Facebook\u2019s vulnerability came from the fact that the data scandal drove a wedge between the company and its users, at least temporarily.</p><p>Indeed, the recent travails of Facebook illustrate that the privacy issue specifically may be the Achilles heel of information platforms. This is an area in which these firms have reason to fear the specter of a user-regulator alliance against the platforms. The permissive consumer consensus that has allowed their conquest of new markets can give way to a more malign consumer view, one that involves thinking twice before mindlessly accepting the terms and conditions of use in a pop-up notification. In this view, an information platform\u2019s domination of and access to information can come to be seen by consumers as a scary invasion of privacy, which needs to be regulated. Its ability to distort information, in response to advertising algorithms or Russian hackers, can lead to a problematic perversion of the public sphere. The salience of privacy is thus the most pressing political concern of these companies, because a consumer focus on privacy undermines the notion that consumers are getting a good deal by trading their data for access to information.</p><p>Looking beyond information platforms and privacy issues, we also observe variation in the relative salience of different issues, depending on the details of political contestation and media coverage in different polities. Some issues are more likely to prime citizen rather than consumer identities (Naoi &amp; Kume, 2015). When that happens, we expect platforms to face greater political headwinds. The contrast between Uber\u2019s reception in the United States and Denmark can serve as an example. Almost everywhere, Uber\u2019s arrival was met by ferocious opposition from established taxi companies, but from that point on, the politics often diverged in different countries (for a full analysis see Thelen, 2018).</p><p>In the United States, Uber was able to frame the conflict on terms favorable to itself, portraying its own role as promoting innovation and consumer choice against inefficient, rent-seeking local taxi monopolies. Uber also pioneered and perfected the strategy of using its app to mobilize consumers and apply pressure on politicians through social media campaigns. Indeed, Uber in 2017 included in its terms and conditions the following language: \u201cUber may also use the information [we collect] to inform you about elections, ballots, referenda and other political and policy processes that relate to our services.\u201d9 When faced with the prospect of unwelcome regulation, the company often responded by adding a tab to its app through which users could register their disapproval to the city government with the push of a button\u2014so much easier than writing a letter or marching on city hall! (Thelen, 2018, p. 7). As Collier et al. (2018) emphasize, Uber was thereby able to channel the way in which the preferences of \u201cthe public\u201d were presented, \u201csolving\u201d consumers\u2019 collective action problems while also controlling the message they sent to policymakers. Such strategies are often rhetorically and politically powerful, allowing these firms to portray themselves as defending the consumer against \u201cstifling\u201d regulation in the interests of efficiency, innovation, and consumer choice.</p><p>In Denmark, by contrast, the central flashpoint around which the conflict over Uber centered was taxation.10 Taxi companies drew attention to the possibility that Uber\u2019s competitive advantage was underwritten by widespread tax evasion on the part of drivers, and in so doing, they enlisted tax authorities, unions, and most political parties as allies in the fight. Danish unions, concerned about the financial underpinnings of a welfare regime that relies heavily on tax-financed universalistic benefits, took up the cause with gusto. The country\u2019s largest union, 3F, hired a public relations firm that employed a well-known Danish comic actor to produce a series of videos featuring \u201cPoul Uberman,\u201d who touted the benefits of the new service, only to have work colleagues or his mother-in-law in a nursing home highlight how Uber was undermining core services of the welfare state. The Danish-language films went viral, achieving over 2.4 million views in a country of 5.7 million people.11 Politically, the union\u2019s campaign made taxes and the welfare state the salient points in the discussion over Uber Denmark, attaching labor\u2019s concerns to a broader coalition that channeled the interests of \u201cthe public\u201d around a discourse centered on community norms of fairness. The point is that people can be primed to respond as consumers or as citizens. The Danish unions were able to reframe the issue of Uber\u2019s entry into the market\u2014appealing to voters as (tax-paying) citizens rather than (convenience-loving) consumers\u2014a winning strategy, since it cast Uber as being premised on a business model that was at odds with the preservation of a national system that works only if everyone is paying their fair share.</p><h>Platforms Appeal Directly to the Public\u2014\u201cWho Could Possibly Be Against This?\u201d</h><p>Platforms have disrupted many markets, often to the delight of consumers and to the chagrin of regulators. As a result, we argue that appealing over the heads of lawmakers or regulators to the public is a strategy that platform companies are more likely to use than other non-platform companies. Many companies run PR campaigns. But for platform companies, given their appeal to consumers, openly political campaigns are likely to be part of the strategy, because they think they can win them.</p><p>Illustrative of this dynamic are Amazon\u2019s early efforts to resist taxation of Internet sales in the United States (see especially Hertel-Fernandez, 2019, pp. 130-133). The early days of the online retailing boom were governed by a 1992 Supreme Court ruling (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Quinn v. North Dakota</emphasis>), which held that states and localities could only tax retailers that had a physical presence in their jurisdiction. The prevailing rules thus gave platforms such as Amazon (and  and ebay) clear sailing across much of the vast American market. However, after the 2008-2009 financial crash, large states such as California and New York confronted intense fiscal pressures and began to look for ways to tax the ballooning Internet retail sales market.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s response was telling. In California, the company teamed up with  to promote a referendum campaign against the resulting legislation. Amazon poured millions into an initiative that flew under the banner \u201cMore Jobs Not Taxes\u201d (Lifsher &amp; Chang, 2011). In the words of the company\u2019s vice president for global public policy: \u201cWe support this referendum against the recent sales tax legislation because, with unemployment at well over 11 per cent, Californians deserve a voice and a choice about jobs, investment and the state\u2019s economic future\u201d (quoted in Jopson &amp; Garrahan, 2011). The referendum was opposed by brick-and-mortar competitors including Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, and Target, whose lobbying group (Alliance for Main Street Fairness) complained that \u201cthe lengths Amazon will go to evade collecting sales taxes\u2014even spending tens of millions of dollars on a ballot initiative\u2014should concern all Californians\u201d (quoted Jopson &amp; Garrahan, 2011). The referendum campaign was called off when Amazon reached a deal with legislators to delay collection of sales taxes for a year.</p><p>A similar New York law imposing sales tax on Internet retailers prompted Amazon to turn to the ALEC, a pro-business group, to try to stanch the tide of state legislation by discussing with the organization \u201chow to mobilize grass roots opposition to new state sales taxes\u201d (2010 ALEC Task Force Agenda, quoted in Hertel-Fernandez, 2019, p. 132). The company\u2019s efforts through ALEC were successful in \u201cstaving off further state action for several years\u201d (Hertel-Fernandez, 2019, p. 132), until the conflict moved to the courts, where the company was less successful. The New York State Court of Appeals upheld that state\u2019s law, a ruling that was reinforced when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider the case (Stohr, 2013).12</p><p>The 2015 battle between Facebook and the telecommunications regulator in India similarly illustrates the platform preference for a public political fight.13 As part of a project initially titled , Facebook proposed to offer Indian consumers a free, stripped-down version of the Facebook app. The app, whose name was changed to Free Basics, disallowed VOIP (voice over Internet protocol) calling services and reserved the right for Facebook to reject other services. As initially explained by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the idea was for tech and telecom companies to provide \u201cfree access to basic Internet services in a way that enables everyone with a phone to get on the Internet and join the knowledge economy while also enabling the industry to continue growing profits and building out this infrastructure\u201d (cited in Prasad, 2018, p. 417). The Free Basics proposal ignited opposition in India, spearheaded by a loose coalition of technology workers and other young professionals who called themselves \u201cSave the Internet\u201d (STI; Soni, 2016). STI released viral videos mocking Free Basics as an attack on the principle of net neutrality. Facebook retaliated with a publicity campaign that cost $45 million and featured billboards promoting \u201cdigital equality.\u201d Zuckerberg himself published an op-ed in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times of India</emphasis> in which he asked, \u201cWho could possibly be against this?\u201d (Hempel, 2018). Zuckerberg and the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, held a joint town hall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, in September 2015.</p><p>The ultimate decision about Free Basics was taken not in parliament, but by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). TRAI held several rounds of public consultation in 2015, in which both STI and Facebook actively campaigned for individuals to leave comments supporting their respective political stances. TRAI officials repeatedly accused Facebook of not following the appropriate procedures of such a regulatory consultation, claiming the company had submitted \u201ca templated response\u201d to their queries, rather than actually answering the questions posed by TRAI. The regulator also challenged the company\u2019s \u201cself-appointed spokesmanship\u201d on behalf of its users, without their consent, observing that \u201cyour urging has the flavor of reducing this meaningful consultation exercise designed to produce informed decisions in a transparent manner into a crudely majoritarian and orchestrated opinion poll\u201d (Soni, 2016; our emphasis). In February 2016, TRAI ruled against Free Basics, determining that differential pricing and \u201czero-rating plans\u201d violated net neutrality in India (Prasad, 2018).</p><p>Platforms do not always prevail in highly politicized public campaigns, as the case of Uber Denmark showed, and they cannot always control the venue in which the conflicts are ultimately decided, as the Free Basics case demonstrated. The point, rather, is that what distinguishes platform firms from most other types of business interests is that their capacity to mobilize consumers means that they do not always seek out the familiar terrain of quiet politics\u2014and indeed on some issues, they may be actively spoiling for an open political fight.</p><h>How Platforms Forum-Shop</h><p>The capacity of companies to enlist consumers as allies, however, depends on having sufficient concentrations of them in a relevant voting jurisdiction. In other words, companies can only mobilize consumers politically when the consumers are themselves electors of the politicians whose jurisdiction they wish to influence. Thus it matters whether a platform service is consumed by locals (as in the case of Uber) or instead by visitors (Airbnb) to whom local politicians may not feel particularly beholden, and indeed may be cross-pressured by local citizens with competing interests. Platforms whose services are consumed locally, such as Uber or Lyft, typically benefit from an expanding user base, as more and more consumers come to rely on the service. Platforms that benefit from these sorts of dynamics understand the political potential this implies and are not shy about exploiting it by weaponizing their users when threatened with regulation.</p><p>By contrast to the rather warm reception Uber enjoyed in most American cities (see especially Tzur, 2017), Airbnb\u2019s growth in large cities has often prompted a backlash. In New York City, for example, it triggered a countermovement that brought together a wide range of local interests who do not often find common cause. Thus, Airbnb confronted a coalition of hotel unions, industry leaders, affordable housing advocates, tenants, and senior citizens (under the moniker \u201cShare Better\u201d; see, for example, Dubin, 2014).14 Share Better ran a $3 million grassroots campaign that rallied around the goal of preventing the trend of taking personal homes off the market by renting units to tourists on the platform.15 Airbnb attempted to rally its hosts to fight . . . but it turned out to be too little too late. Airbnb\u2019s customer base is scattered around the country and the world\u2014not ideal for lobbying legislators who listen to their own constituents. (\u201cNo Vacancy,\u201d 2017)</p><p>Similar dynamics played out in other cities including San Francisco, New Orleans, Seattle, and Berlin. The result in many of the most lucrative urban markets has been to envelop the company in stronger regulations involving some combination of registration requirements for Airbnb hosts, rules on the length of allowable stays, arrangements for payment of taxes, and other measures that have placed limits on the company\u2019s growth within particular jurisdictions.</p><p>Airbnb\u2019s response to political opposition expressed by city governments in Europe shows that it understands the need to align its political strategy with its consumer base. Faced with pressure from localities like Barcelona and Paris, the company has taken its lobbying to the EU level. Europe as a whole has a lot more tourists looking for deals on rooms than Barcelona or Berlin do. Armed with a better match between its user base and jurisdictional authority, Airbnb has pressed at the level of the European Commission for rules that favor the sharing economy and limit local initiatives that curb the use of Airbnb and services like it. This lobbying has led to interpretive rulings from the European Commission that allow platform companies not to share their data with local jurisdictions and that require Commission approval of efforts to place quantitative limits on the amount of housing rented through the sharing economy (CEO, 2018).</p><p>As a lobbyist, the legitimacy of Airbnb representatives is reinforced by the perception that the company is on the side of the consumer, even if they are lobbying <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">against actual consumer groups</emphasis>. According to Michela Vuerich of the consumer group ANEC, Airbnb\u2019s efforts acquired legitimacy with EU policymakers because of the company\u2019s perceived connection to consumers: \u201cwhat I found frustrating is that Airbnb is often seen as representing the consumer view in meetings, while they obviously represent their business only . . .\u201d (CEO, 2018, p. 11). We contend that the reason Airbnb can effectively don the mantle of consumer advocate is because consumers have come to depend on the platform as a way to avoid high hotel prices.</p><p>Politicians are more likely to bend to platforms where the platform\u2019s users are their own voters, which helps to explain why mayors across a range of cities in different countries have imposed more regulations on Airbnb than Uber. Airbnb has sought to turn the tables by taking its bargaining to the EU, where it can claim to speak for consumers across Europe, as opposed to local governments that are not responsive to consumers who live elsewhere.</p><h>Conclusion</h><p>Social science generally lags behind the world that it studies, and probably more so when economic and technological changes are proceeding as briskly as in the current moment. It seems incontrovertible that some platform firms exercise outsized power in many political economies today, and notably in the United States and the EU. We expect that Tencent and Alibaba are similarly disrupting the world of those who study corporate power in China, though the representative democratic context is a likely scope condition for the sorts of dynamics of influence we have put forward here. What we do know is that the conventional concepts of instrumental and structural power do not capture well the political strengths that Facebook, Google, and Amazon exercise in the modern economy. Likewise, although their size and market power\u2014and associated legal debates over monopoly control\u2014are very important for the future political influence of these companies, a simple market power view misses what is most distinctive about the political advantages enjoyed by platform firms.</p><p>Many of those advantages flow from the way that consumers experience the fruits of radical platform innovation. Both instrumental and structural power have emerged from a conceptual worldview according to which there is a demand for public policy that captures a governing majority in parliament, which business is then able to thwart (Fairfield, 2015). By bringing in to our analysis consumers, who enjoy an intimate dependency on the platform companies, we highlight that radical innovation has brought us radically different potential monopolists than in the past. These companies are good at quiet politics, but they do not require it to get their way. Some of these companies can actively mobilize consumers, while others can count on a wellspring of trust and dependence. \u201cWhat would we do without Amazon?\u201d may not excite the revolutionary fervor of class warriors, but it is an effective statement of a distinctive source of the power that Amazon enjoys in today\u2019s politics. In much of political economy, consumers have been left outside of the central models of political conflict, or if included as consumers, included as voters who consume. We reverse that identity: the bulwark of platform companies in democratic countries are consumers who vote.</p><p>We have drawn attention to Lindblom\u2019s work on volitions and the potential impact of business power on citizen preferences. To the extent that people come to prefer what powerful platforms want, they become tacit or even active supporters of policies that may harm their objectively defined material interests. Defenders of such a view might usefully point to the fact that Google can influence where we go on the Internet by its auto-complete function; Facebook is the news portal of choice for many; and Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, has bought the influential U.S. newspaper, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Post</emphasis>. Indeed, the machine learning capacities of Google and Facebook may allow them to predict consumer preferences better than consumers themselves can, and that capacity may have important political implications for preference formation.16 The influencing of public opinion is an important source of business power, and it certainly has a role to play in the political arsenal of the platform firms, particularly given how they depend on a reservoir of public goodwill for their political influence. Yet platform companies in these respects resemble companies in other sectors more than they differ from them. And where they differ from them is in the way they benefit from consumer dependence and the terms of the new markets they have created for consumers.</p><p>Our broader intellectual objective in this article is to open up the discussion on business power in at least two ways. First, we think that the radical innovation associated with platform companies is not the last and possibly not the most significant change in business power in 21st century capitalism. Understanding the new sources of business influence requires grasping what is new about the new economy while putting it in the context of what we know about existing sources of business influence. Technological change does not merely lead to an updating of old ways of doing things; sometimes it leads to profoundly new modes of influence peddling. Second, and less boldly, we build on the work of prior scholarship in making a plea for a more central role for consumers in the study of political economy (Naoi &amp; Kume, 2015; Rahman &amp; Thelen, 2019; Rogowski &amp; Kayser, 2002; Schor, 1999; Trumbull, 2006). The way in which consumption defines political preferences, and the way it intersects with older and more organized cleavages such as that between labor and capital, seem to us promising exploratory avenues for modernizing how we think about power in politics and the economy.</p><p>Finally, however, we want to end on a cautious note. While the relationship between key platform firms and consumers is critical to what we call platform power, we remain skeptical about the possibility that unorganized consumers can play an effective role in durably countervailing the political influence of platform companies, whether considered individually or collectively. We have discussed the role of exogenous privacy shocks in weakening the influence of platform firms at particular legislative moments: during the amendment process of the EU\u2019s GDPR legislation in 2013 and possibly in the present moment, with the repeated revelations about Facebook\u2019s lax protection of users\u2019 data. These are politically consequential events, and they have the capacity to overturn the permissive consensus that has until now been a strong source of platform power. But the aftermath of the Snowden revelations reminds us that consumers can get angry, but they also have short memories. If democracies do decide that platform power gives these companies unfair advantages in politics, then we suspect that the role of consumers will be only part of the story. Indeed, we have suggested that courts and competition authorities may pose the biggest threats to platform power, precisely because of their relative insulation from consumer pressure. We predict that if the power of these companies is to be countervailed in a durable fashion, these are the actors who will lead that change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Ash T.

The platforms themselves often drive traffic to harmful conspiracy theories and extremism, through their algorithms and recommendation engines.</p><p>The debate has become more partisan, as conservative commentators and demagogues (including Donald Trump, the president of the United States) have claimed that the moderation of content has an inherent bias against them, on the basis of ideology, as Silicon Valley tech execs are dominated by 'liberal elites'.</p><p>The latest iteration of the debate has focussed on the prominent role of the larger tech companies within society, and whether they are the modern equivalent of the public square.</p><p>The US Supreme Court, in Packingham v North Carolina, unanimously held that states can't broadly limit access to social media.</p><p>The corollary is that by virtue of their size and prominence, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have an obligation to facilitate the free and unencumbered flow of speech.</p><p>The tech giants again find themselves desperately seeking a middle ground. On one side are liberal-leaning activists and commentators, and advocates for minorities and vulnerable groups, highlighting what they claim are purveyors of xenophobia and hatred, against, for example, Muslims and immigrants; on the other side are conservatives, claiming that discussion about important societal issues is being stifled when it deviates from the liberal orthodoxy.</p><p>The platforms' own internal judgements are the basis for these decisions, which is precarious, if you accept the idea that they are the modern incarnation of the public sphere.</p><p>[h2]Big Tech[/h2]</p><p>Traditionally, scepticism of large corporations that wield too much power is the purview of the political left, but not in the context of the internet culture wars, as right-wing demagogues are 'purged' from online platforms.</p><p>On the flip side, latter-day conservatives in the US have afforded more power to the private realm and promoted the virtues of marketdynamics to resolve these product/market issues, but, nowadays, the argument against Big Tech is more regularly articulated by those on the right. A cynic might conclude that both sides are being disingenuous and self-serving.</p><p>[readmore]943517[/readmore]</p><p>On this issue, you can find strange bedfellows. US-based Irish cultural critic Angela Nagle, a leftist in the tradition of UK Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (Nagle has been exiled from the progressive movement for deviating from certain liberal shibboleths) has argued that banning someone from a social platform \"would be like banning a dissident figure from using the post office or a bank,\" and that we are \"allowing a few global monopolies to have absolute control over what information is accessible to the world.\"</p><p>She has found common ground with Fox News presenter TuckerCarlson, whose show routinely hosts guests and airs segments that drive anti-immigrant narratives andconspiracy theories; he is regularly cited as a mainstream proponent of the white replacement theory, which feeds into the paranoia from which white supremacists draw their motivation.</p><p>In a recent editorial on his show, Carlson argued that by \"censoring\" dissenting voices on Facebook, for example, \"left-wing tech companies control the political debate.\"</p><p>The platforms' policies are largely being defined in response to each novel situation that arises, a high stakes challenge when political candidates and elected representatives are involved.</p><p>English Defence League founder and former MEP candidate, Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), recently had his YouTube account neutered - but not deleted - amid claims of hate speech.</p><p>The channel was demonetised, live streaming was disabled, and it was removed from search results, effectively rendering it a glorified video-hosting server (critics who responded include Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who said that YouTube are a \"complete disgrace\" for failing to block the content entirely).</p><p>Meanwhile, Twitter has decided that normal rules and policies do not apply to political leaders such as US president, Donald Trump, many of whose tweets probably contravene the platform's terms of use.</p><p>In a blog post, the company concluded that, \"blocking a world leader from Twitter, or removing their controversial tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate.\"</p><p>In Ireland, former presidential aspirant Gemma O'Doherty has recently had her YouTube account deleted, because of claims of xenophobia, prompting a modest, but enduring, protest outside Google HQ on Dublin's Barrow St.</p><p>[h2]Exiled[/h2]</p><p>For their part, exiles from the mainstream platforms, and their sympathisers (including free speech absolutists, who don't necessarily align with them politically), have had to come up with creative solutions to what they see as encroachment on the open exchange of ideas.</p><p>This has resulted in alternative platforms, including Twitter clone Gab, whose slogan is, \"a social network that champions free speech, individual liberty, and the free flow of information online,\" and which has become a magnet for anti-Semites and racists.</p><p>Gab recently moved its software to a decentralised, 'federated' system, called Mastodon, having been temporarily shut down by its hosting provider. Psychology professor and self-styled free speech defender, Jordan Peterson, is also planning to launch a new platform, ThinkSpot, \"an intellectual playground for censorship-free discourse,\" which is sure to be popular.</p><p>[readmore]943449[/readmore]</p><p>There have also been attempts to recover revenue streams when they are removed from a user's channel, often YouTube's first move for contentious content.</p><p>This was initially an attraction of using a third-party service like Patreon, where patrons can support content creators for what they post on mainstream platforms, while still maintaining independence from them.</p><p>However, Patreon, too, has fallen out of favour with those on the right, after shutting down the accounts of certain controversial figures, such as Sargon of Akkad and Milo Yiannopoulos, for hate speech, inspiring an exodus of conservative users from the service.</p><p>Digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin is ubiquitous in particular online groups, and it is stable, in the sense that it cannot be 'switched off', but is cumbersome and not regular or reliable.</p><p>More recently, software solution Entropy was launched as a kind of 'wrapper' around YouTube live streams, claiming to facilitate much of the same functionality that YouTube disables for contentious accounts - including user donations.</p><p>[h2]Alternatives[/h2]</p><p>What the Cloudflare decision reveals is that it is not just whether or not a specific account is shut down on a particular platform, but it is also the very plumbing of the internet, which is in the hands of private technology companies.</p><p>Most people will not weep over the plight of 8chan, but it does put the situation into focus.</p><p>And there are a number of layers in hosting content such as the El Paso murderer's manifesto, and, arguably, a number of layers of culpability in facilitating the dissemination of hateful propaganda.</p><p>Server hosts, security providers, domain registrars, payment companies, crowdfunding platforms, and myriad other discreet service providers all conspire to bring you the websites that you read every day - and the divisive hate that you probably don't - and they can take it away, too.</p><p>Despite a lot of hand-wringing, legislators have so far failed to regulate social platforms - while many human rights and privacy advocates query whether they should at all - so, in the meantime, private technology companies remain the arbiters of acceptable content on the internet.</p><p>This creates something of an arms race, as popular service providers - whether for narrow commercial reasons or an unwavering commitment to basic decency - offload users that they allege promote hate and division, and the users seek, and usually find, alternatives.</p><p>While Cloudflare is the de facto standard for website defence, there are competitors, many of whom are sure to be less scrupulous (or more impervious to public pressure, depending on your perspective), so 8chan will be back online soon enough, though it remains to be seen for how long.</p><p>[readmore]943420[/readmore]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-943693</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTK-KMK1-JCW9-2426-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1621\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

That is not to say the media is faultless - far from it - but it has a self-deprecating dimension that tech often lacks.</p><p>The forceful - some would argue over-the-top - threats with which Google and Facebook have responded to a proposed Australian code of conduct aiming to force them to pay for the journalism they use on their platforms perfectly illustrate big tech's inability to take criticism.</p><p>The world is watching the attempt by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims to regulate Google and Facebook in the hope that the code can work. This isn't a random, kooky regulator with a hare-brained idea.</p><p>Google and Facebook blame digital classifieds businesses such as SEEK and Carsales for traditional media's struggles - and they have played a part. But the tech giants shirk any responsibility. The companies have unprecedented global scale and reach, and have on multiple occasions been found abusing this near monopoly power. Their scale has given them a stranglehold over digital advertising. They enjoy the benefits of posting journalism on their platforms and say they deliver their value in clicks, so they shouldn't have to pay the media companies.</p><p>Google has aggressively fought the code. It says it is prepared to pay for content, but there is a huge discrepancy between what it offers and what media companies hope mandatory payment under the code of conduct will deliver.</p><p>Facebook is so opposed to paying for journalism that it has threatened to ban it from its platform in Australia.</p><p>The Social Dilemma describes at length how the platforms' algorithms manipulate their users - hitting them at their most vulnerable - to steal more and more of their time so they can be shown even more ads to garner more profits for the tech giants.</p><p>This isn't all new. Social media has played a big part in the steady rise in teen anxiety and self-harm. Fake news spreads faster than real news, and we know tech algorithms are designed to feed people content they're more likely to engage with so as to draw them farther down the rabbit hole.</p><p>Conspiracy groups such as Wake Up Australia - which doesn't believe COVID-19 is a real threat - continue to be recommended to Facebook users, illustrating the tech giant's apathy about the problem of engagement being promoted regardless of the truth.</p><p>The film puts all this forcefully. It's easy for these mostly male \"tech bros\" who have made their fortunes and moved on to say: \"Oops, we didn't realise what we were doing. Sorry, it needs to change.\"</p><p>Thanks to Steve Jobs, the smartphone's glow has become ever-present in the daily lives of billions of people. Yet Jobs reportedly didn't let his kids use iPads.</p><p>\"A computer to me is the most remarkable tool we've come up with ... it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds,\" Jobs said in 1981 about a Scientific American experiment that showed how well humans had improved their locomotive efficiency by inventing the bicycle.</p><p>Former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Centre for Humane Technology and a contributor to The Social Dilemma, throws Jobs' 1981 quote back at the audience.</p><p>\"No one got upset when bicycles showed up, right?\" he says. \"When everyone started to go around on bicycles, none said: 'Oh my god we've just ruined society.' Like 'bicycles are affecting people, they're pulling people away from their kids, they're ruining the fabric of democracy, people can't tell what's true'. Like, we never said any of that stuff about a bicycle.</p><p>\"If something is a tool, it genuinely is just sitting there, waiting patiently. If something is not a tool, it's demanding things from you, it's seducing you, it's manipulating you ... Social media isn't a tool that's just waiting to be used. It has its own goals, and it has its own means of pursuing them by using your psychology against you.\"</p><p>The problem with the film is that it's short on solutions, other than \"delete all apps\" and \"turn off notifications\". The director reportedly did not give the tech companies a right of reply, though we've heard it all before - \"we're working hard, we're developing new AI products to help\" - and fault is never really admitted, let alone acted on.</p><p>The Social Dilemma would have us believe the evils of Google, Facebook et al are the logical conclusion of capitalism - a \"profit at all costs\" model. It fails to understand capitalism and the many examples of companies recognising something has to change, and acting before government does.</p><p>Shareholders have forced - and some companies have independently implemented - a range of important changes with climate policy. A long list of banks, including Australia's big four, financial institutions and insurance companies have shunned the controversial Adani Carmichael coal mine and associated operations.</p><p>The problem at Facebook is control is centralised around founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and his iron grip on the social media giant's voting stock.</p><p>Capitalism is about the market working through the most efficient means of operating, which may include decisions that hurt short-term profits but benefit long-term profits and social standing. Facebook shareholders simply can't force any change because all the power resides with one man.</p><p>The unintended consequences of Google and Facebook not seeing the writing on the wall - that they do get value from news, and it is actually worth paying for - are weaker media outlets, job losses, and proliferation of fake news on their platforms, driving conspiracy theories, social divide and profits for the tech giants.</p><p>That's why the Australian government and ACCC stepped in with a code to force Facebook and Google to pay for the value journalism on their platforms.</p><p>Speculation is Treasury and the ACCC will look to work through changes to the draft code, proposed in late July, to be put to the government in the first week of October, with the intention of introducing the legislation into Parliament between October 19 and 29, although this is fluid.</p><p>The code is one small step that Facebook and Google need to take, and will probably be followed around the world if it works. The harder steps will be weaning themselves off their own morphine drip of quarterly profit growth to sustain their businesses in the long-term, instead of waiting until they implode.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7cjdocr2bg82tf5ekum</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6100-GN11-JD34-V0NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1221\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That is not to say the media are faultless - far from it, but they have a self-deprecating dimension tech often lacks.</p><p>The forceful - some would argue over-the-top - threats with which Google and Facebook have responded to a proposed Australian code of conduct aiming to force them to pay for the journalism they use on their platforms perfectly illustrate Big Tech's inability to take criticism.</p><p>Shirking responsibility</p><p>The world is watching the attempt by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims to regulate Google and Facebook in the hope that the code can work. This isn't a random, kooky regulator with a hare-brained idea. It's a global issue many governments and regulators want to resolve.</p><p>Spain and France have failed in their attempts to make the platforms pay for journalism. Google and Facebook blame digital classifieds businesses such as SEEK and Carsales for traditional media's struggles - and they have played a part. But the tech giants shirk any responsibility and deny they've done any harm.</p><p>The two companies have unprecedented global scale and reach, and have on multiple occasions been found abusing this near monopoly power. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/how-google-and-facebooks-trillion-dollar-duopoly-strangles-the-internet-20170328-gv7zxi\">Their scale has given them a stranglehold over digital advertising to a point that only makes financial sense because of their size</url>. They enjoy the benefits of posting journalism on their platforms and say they deliver their value in clicks, so they shouldn't have to pay the media companies.</p><p>Google and Facebook have inserted themselves as intermediaries between publishers and consumers and continue to argue the value of journalism on their platforms is negligible. Google has aggressively fought the code. It says it is prepared to pay for content, but there is a huge discrepancy between what it offers and what media companies hope mandatory payment under the code of conduct will deliver.</p><p>So opposed is Facebook to paying for journalism that it has threatened to ban it from its platform in Australia altogether. This would undoubtedly harm Facebook and Australia, making the country an easier target for foreign manipulation.</p><p>\"Without a common set of facts, it's hard to move people towards a common end,\" Michael Jensen, associate professor at the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis at the University of Canberra, told a Senate committee on foreign interference through social media last Friday.</p><p>The Social Dilemma describes at length how the platform's algorithms manipulate their users - hitting them at their most vulnerable - to steal more and more of their time so they can be shown even more ads to garner more profits for the tech giants.</p><p>Time to wake up?</p><p>This isn't all new. Social media has played a big part in the steady rise in teen anxiety and self-harm. Fake news spreads faster than real news, and we know tech algorithms are designed to feed people content they're more likely to engage with so as to draw them farther down the rabbit hole.</p><p>Conspiracy groups like Wake Up Australia - which doesn't believe COVID-19 is a real threat - continue to be recommended to Facebook users, perfectly illustrating the tech giant's apathy about the problem of engagement being promoted regardless of the truth.</p><p>The film puts all this forcefully, even manipulatively. It's very easy for these mostly male \"tech bros\" who've made their fortunes and moved on to say, \"oops, we didn't realise what we were doing. Sorry, it needs to change\".</p><p>We all know we should spend less time on our phones. Thanks to Steve Jobs the smartphone's glow has become ever-present in the daily lives of billions of people across the world. Yet <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/fashion/steve-jobs-apple-was-a-low-tech-parent.html\">Jobs reportedly didn't let his kids use iPads</url>.</p><p>\"A computer to me is the most remarkable tool we've come up with ... it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds,\" Jobs said in 1981 about a Scientific American experiment that showed how well humans had improved their locomotive efficiency relative to other species by inventing the bicycle.</p><p>Former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Centre for Humane Technology and an omnipresent contributor to The Social Dilemma, throws Jobs' 1981 quote back at the audience.</p><p>\"No one got upset when bicycles showed up, right?\" he says. \"When everyone started to go around on bicycles, none said 'oh my god we've just ruined society'. Like 'bicycles are affecting people, they're pulling people away from their kids, they're ruining the fabric of democracy, people can't tell what's true'. Like, we never said any of that stuff about a bicycle.</p><p>\"If something is a tool, it genuinely is just sitting there, waiting patiently. If something is not a tool, it's demanding things from you, it's seducing you, it's manipulating you, it wants things from you.</p><p>\"We've moved away from having a tools-based technology environment to an addiction and a manipulation-based technology environment. That's what's changed.</p><p>\"Social media isn't a tool that's just waiting to be used. It has its own goals, and it has its own means of pursuing them by using your psychology against you.\"</p><p>The problem with the film is that it's short on solutions, other than \"delete all apps\" and \"turn off notifications\". The director reportedly did not give the tech companies a right of reply, though we've heard it all before - \"we're working hard, we're developing new AI products to help\" - and fault is never really admitted, let alone acted on.</p><p>The Social Dilemma would have us believe the evils of Google, Facebook et al are the logical conclusion of capitalism - a \"profit at all costs\" model. It fails to understand capitalism and the many examples of companies recognising something has to change and acting before government does.</p><p>Zuckerberg's iron grip</p><p>Shareholders have forced - and some companies have independently implemented - a range of important changes with climate change policy. A<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/investec-ditches-adani-over-climate-change-20200618-p553ze\"> long list of banks, including Australia's big four, financial institutions and insurance companies have shunned the controversial Adani Carmichael coal mine and associated operations</url>.</p><p>The problem at Facebook is control is centralised around founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and his iron grip on the social media giant's voting stock.</p><p>Capitalism is about the market working through the most efficient means of operating, which may include decisions that hurt short-term profits but benefit long-term profits and social standing. Facebook shareholders simply can't force any change because all the power resides with one man.</p><p>\"Facebook operates essentially as a dictatorship ... Our board is locked into an outdated governance structure that reduces board accountability to shareholders,\" says one shareholder proposal from 2019. </p><p>Tech giants like Facebook and Google refuse to acknowledge the unintended consequences of their unprecedented growth and stranglehold over the advertising and media industries, and the human population in general.</p><p>The unintended consequences of Google and Facebook not seeing the writing on the wall - that they do get value from news, and it is actually worth paying for - are weaker media outlets, job losses, and proliferation of fake news on their platforms, driving conspiracy theories, social divide and profits for the tech giants.</p><p>That's why the Australian government and ACCC stepped in with a code to force Facebook and Google to pay for the value journalism on their platforms.</p><p>Speculation is Treasury and the ACCC will look to work through changes to the draft code, proposed in late July, to be put to government in the first week of October, with the intention of introducing the legislation into Parliament in the sitting period between October 19 and 29, although this is fluid.</p><p>The code is one small step that Facebook and Google need to take, and will likely be followed around the world if it works. The harder steps will be weaning themselves off their own morphine drip of quarterly profit growth to sustain their businesses in the long-term, instead of waiting until they implode.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520331936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YY-DRX1-DY19-C52Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><timeReceived>00:04 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

When it comes to voicing a contrary opinion on the most sensitive political and cultural topics, however, many of our tongues are tied and our fingers shy away from the keyboard. Better not to say anything, we reason, than to deal with the blow back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer to this speech-chilling political correctness is not a new law but personal courage, free speech attorney-turned-writer David French of the National Review Institute argued this past week in a speech in Atlanta.</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a position that is different from the classic defense of free speech in this country,\u201d French said. Rather than admitting none of us knows everything, and thus some humility is in order, too many Americans won\u2019t accept they may need to change their minds from time to time. Or that they would benefit from explaining their own opinion, and not shouting down their opponents.</p><p> Much of the problem stems from what\u2019s been called \u201cthe big sort\u201d \u2013 the physical movement of people toward places where their neighbors will be more like-minded. \u201cAmericans are less likely to live near and work with people who disagree with them than at any time since we\u2019ve been measuring that,\u201d French said.</p><p> But because people tend to become more extreme in their views when they only talk with those who agree with them, we\u2019ve lost not only our willingness to engage with others but the belief we even need to do so.</p><p> How bad has it gotten? \u201cPeople are more likely to prefer their son or daughter marry a person of a different faith than a different political party,\u201d French said, quipping that for many on the right, \u201ceternal damnation is preferable to a Democrat.\u201d</p><p> Although these attitudes concern politics, count French as someone who does not believe there\u2019s a political solution. Rather, a cultural solution is needed. And that\u2019s where the personal courage comes in.</p><p> \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be intimidated into silence,\u201d he said, because that silence becomes self-reinforcing and makes it harder to speak up the next time.</p><p> But the answer is not to fight fire with fire.</p><p> \u201cThe opposite of political correctness is not acting like a jerk,\u201d French said. \u201cIt\u2019s speaking the truth with grace and humility and fearlessness. There is such a thing as being fearlessly reasonable.\u201d</p><p> Along with that is a legal corollary to the Golden Rule: \u201cDefend the rights of others that you would like to exercise yourself.\u201d</p><p> And an answer to the \u201csnowflake\u201d mentality on many college campuses: \u201cDo your best to be unoffendable.

You'll soon have American data protection laws to deal with, too. California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA[1]) goes into effect January 1, 2020 \u2014 that's less than 3 months away. And additional American legislation is wending its way through various state houses in the United States, starting with New York (SHIELD Act[2]). Regardless of where your company is based, if you serve customers who live in California and New York, you must be compliant or face fines. </p><p>Since Europe rolled out GDPR, its landmark data privacy rules, 18 months ago, the online industry, despite having two years to prepare, has been hit with fine after fine for violations. During GDPR's first year, 90,000+[3] businesses voluntarily reported breaches as they struggled to attain compliance. This was topped with 145,000+[4] consumer complaints. Like most legislation, ignorance of the law is no excuse \u2014 and likewise, the offender's intent provides no safe harbor. Regulators pay no heed to whether a breach is accidental or the result of outright negligence. They do, however, levy greater fines for obvious, deliberate, or willful flaunting of the law. And EU regulators have famously made an example of some well-known companies. In January 2019, Google paid a \u20ac50 million fine[5] to French authorities for its lack of transparency in the collection and use of personal data for ad targeting. A few months earlier, a Portuguese hospital paid \u20ac400,000[6] for its poor patient record control practices. (For convenience, systems administrators created nearly 1,000 doctor-level access accounts. This allowed almost 1,000 user accounts to have unrestricted access to patient data when there were fewer than 300 actual doctors on staff.) A Danish taxi company was fined 1.2 million kroner[7] after it was discovered they had been hoarding more than 9 million customer records containing personally identifiable information, long after these were required for business purposes. This was in contravention of the GDPR's requirement to delete customer records when no longer required. And to the cheers of millions, Polish authorities pounced on a spamming operation[8] in their country that scraped email addresses from public web pages and aggregated these for sending unsolicited commercial email. 12,000 recipients from a 90,000-strong distribution list complained, resulting in a \u20ac220,000 fine. This list is far from exhaustive. An online GDPR enforcement tracker[9] is attempting to capture all of the abuses reported by European authorities under the new legislation, including a pending \u20ac204 million fine against British Airways[10] for a compromise involving 500,000 of its customers' payment information.Comparing the GDPR and CCPA: Some highlightsThere are some key differences[11] between the CCPA and GDPR. Broadly, the CCPA is less prescriptive about acceptable practices than GDPR, and even in the case of a reported infraction, the per-incident fine is insignificant unless a very large number of users report the problem. Minimum standard for being on the CCPA radar. Whereas the GDPR essentially has no minimum criteria for applicability, the CCPA will likely not govern your activity if your revenue is under $25 million and you're not in the business of transacting the personal data of more than 50,000 users \u2014 even if you have a breach. But if you do meet the minimum standard, your service gets compromised, and user data to is breached, CCPA bites down significantly harder than GDPR. Extent of fines. GDPR has caps in place to ensure that fines do not exceed a significant portion of an offender's revenue, but the only limit to the fines that could be levied against a CCPA offender is the number of users affected. The CCPA sets out a per user fine of $100 - $750 or actual damages (whichever is larger) for even an unintentional breach, so a smallish web service experiencing a breach of 1 million user accounts could easily be fined out of existence. User opt-out vs. opt-in. Under CCPA, users must opt out from information sharing with third-parties, whereas GDPR demands that users explicitly opt-in. In more general terms, the CCPA is more lenient (though it emphasises different attributes) around proactive disclosure and handling of minors. Speaking broadly, if your service is GDPR compliant, your practices will generally meet or exceed the expectations of CCPA.Less than half of companies appear readyThe extraterritoriality of GDPR means that if your business serves European customers, you're obligated to meet this legislation's stringent requirements, regardless of where your company is located. Similarly, if you're operating in or serving customers in any way in the United States, the New York and California-mandated protections will apply to you and your customers. According to an August 2019 IAPP and OneTrust[12] survey of mostly US businesses (of all sizes), while 74 percent of survey respondents believe their employer needs to comply with California's upcoming privacy rules, only around 2 percentsaid their companies are already fully prepared for it. Despite the growing havoc wreaked by GDPR, only 47 percent of survey respondents are expecting to be prepared for CCPA by the January 1 deadline. This is particularly true for organizations who are still not yet GDPR compliant. If your company isn't ready, then it's time to get serious. As GDPR has demonstrated, even a small, localized misjudgment can have huge consequences.<url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cppa_readiness.jpg?resize=928%2C435...ip=all?strip=all\">https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cppa_readiness.jpg?resize=928%2C435...ip=all?strip=all</url> Above: Survey question: Approximately when do you expect your organization to be in full compliance with the CCPA? (Results are show for 2 versions of the IAPP/OneTrust survey, one conducted in April and the most recent in August.) Even if you don't think either of these laws applies to your business today, it makes sense to apply their standards anyway. Non-applicability under the law does not exempt an organization from liability against civil suits in the event of a breach or compromised standards. Both these, and pending legislation around across the US and around the world, set a standard that judges may look at when considering cases (as yet untested under these laws) directly between companies and affected customers. And at the end of the day, protecting customers ultimately protects the trust in and reputation of your business and your brand \u2014 things that could have a higher value than potential fines now or down the road.
