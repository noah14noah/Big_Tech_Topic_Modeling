(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF THE HOUR: \u2014 Trump hopeful to have virus vaccine on market by end of year or shortly after \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence is adding five new members to the government's coronavirus task force \u2014 Parts of western Pennsylvania begin to ease restrictions ___ LISBON, Portugal \u2014 Portugal will transition to its second phase of scaling back confinement measures following the positive government assessment of the evolution of its COVID-19 outbreak. </p><p>The first stage of the reopening process began with small shops and businesses such as hairdressers. Phase two starting Monday will include restaurants, bars, cafes and other shops opening under capacity limitations and social distancing restrictions. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa also unveiled the plan for the reopening of beaches on June 6. Social distancing restrictions will have to be in place, with a maximum capacity for each beach. The government announced that citizens will be able to check online or via a mobile phone application the current capacity of each beach . Portugal has 20,583 confirmed cases and 1,190 deaths from the pandemic. ___ LAS VEGAS -- The city of Las Vegas has announced that downtown restaurants and businesses operating under the first two phases of state reopening orders are allowed to extend operations to the sidewalk during regular business hours.  The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that outdoor dining and sidewalk sales are now permitted. But each business must continue implementing social distancing measures by keeping tables, chairs and other furniture six feet from pedestrian paths. City spokesman Jace Radke says Las Vegas is currently in the first stage of reopening, which went into effect Saturday. The second phase will allow establishments to expand operations outside with additional restrictions. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.  ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence is adding five new members to the government's coronavirus task force as the White House increasingly focuses on efforts to reopen the country safely and hasten the development of vaccines for COVID-19. The new members include two doctors focused on vaccine development: Dr. Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also joining the task force of about 20 members are Thomas Engels, director of the Health Resources and Services Administration, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. Pence made the changes barely a week after the White House bowed to public pressure and shelved plans to begin to shut down the task force, which has been managing the U.S. response to the coronavirus since late January. The task force announcement comes as Trump named a former pharmaceutical executive to lead his administration's all-out effort to produce and distribute a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year. ___ CHARLESTON, W.Va. __ West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice on Friday stressed that medical experts are leading his plan to lift coronavirus restrictions, days after he widened his strategy at the request of business owners. The Republican governor has expanded the most aggressive stage of his reopening plan to allow the reopening of gyms and tanning salons next week after he said the businesses bombarded his office with calls. Still, he said it's 'way out in left field' to suggest he is making decisions based on political pressure. 'That noise or that pressure is not going to influence a decision in any way, no possibility,' he said. The governor has timed several reopenings around Memorial Day weekend. Gyms can open Monday. On Thursday, tanning salons, restaurants at half-capacity, big box stores and all-terrain vehicle rental businesses can reopen. Campgrounds can open for in-state residents Thursday, as can the Hatfield-McCoy trails, whitewater rafting and zipline businesses. The Greenbrier, a private resort Justice owns, is also set to reopen May 22. It is unclear exactly what criteria Justice is using to decide when certain businesses resume operations. A visibly frustrated Justice also railed against Democrats, including state lawmakers and U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, for requesting that he spend the $1.25 billion the federal government sent West Virginia to cover medical expenses for the pandemic. 'I am absolutely not going to put this pandemic up with politics,' he said in an aside that referenced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has become a frequent target during Justice's daily news briefings. Justice has said he wants to use the federal aid package to backfill the state's ailing budget, though rules prevent such spending. At least 62 people in West Virginia have died from the virus and around 1,400 have tested positive, health officials said. ___ VANCOUVER, British Columbia. Canada's Pacific Coast province of British Columbia is allowing schools to reopen on June 1 but on an optional and part time basis. British Columbia Education Minister Rob Fleming says kindergarten through grade five will be open two or three days. Fleming says there will be staggered lunches and recesses. Fleming says grade six through 12 students will likely only attend school once a week. Parents will be given the choice to allow their children to attend. British Columbia Premier John Horgan says these steps will pave the way for a full start in September if it is safe. The province has roughly 2,392 of Canada's 74,532 confirmed cases. ___ LOS ANGELES -- A Navy hospital ship that came to the Port of Los Angeles to help the region during the coronavirus crisis has departed. Tugs pulled the Mercy away from its dock shortly after 7 a.m. Friday.  The 1,000-bed ship arrived in Los Angeles harbor at the end of March to provide beds for non-coronavirus cases to take the load off regional medical centers preparing for a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. However, Los Angeles hasn't been overrun with virus cases, and so the Mercy didn't play a huge role as a safety net. The ship is returning to San Diego. ___ HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 Another 2.6 million people across western Pennsylvania began to emerge from pandemic restrictions Friday as Gov. Tom Wolf prepared to announce that 12 more counties soon would join them in a partial easing. Wolf planned to announce that Adams, Beaver, Carbon, Columbia, Cumberland, Juniata, Mifflin, Perry, Susquehanna, Wyoming, Wayne and York will be the next batch of counties moving to the 'yellow' phase of his reopening plan, effective May 22, The Associated Press has learned. They are primarily in the south-central and northeast regions of the state. They'll join residents of 13 lightly impacted counties \u2014 including the cities of Pittsburgh, Johnstown and Altoona \u2014 where Wolf lifted his stay-at-home orders on Friday and gave permission for retailers and other types of businesses to reopen. Twenty-four counties across a vast swath of primarily rural northern Pennsylvania were the first to see a partial reopening last week. All told, by the end of next week, more than 40% of Pennsylvania's population of 12.8 million will have seen an easing of pandemic restrictions that were intended to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with very ill COVID-19 patients.  ___ SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chile's capital is increasing restrictions on movement as of Friday night to battle an upsurge in COVID-19 cases. The 8 million people in metropolitan Santiago have accounted for more than 80% of the 39,542 confirmed casess in the country of 18 million people. Cases have almost duplicated over the past week. There have been nearly 400 deaths in all. Under the new restrictions, people will have to receive a police permit to leave home \u2014 though the online system allows as many as seven per week. Food markets and pharmacies will remain open and workers in fields such as health, water and energy services are exempt. Violators can be fined the equivalent of thousands of dollars. The Ministry of Health said critical care units for COVID-19 at hospitals in the region are at at 90% to 95% capacity. Hours before the new restrictions were to take effect, highways were crowded with people trying to have the city for the coast in spite of prohibitions on people using second homes to ride out the quarantine. Long lines formed at supermarkets. ___ TIRANA, Albania - An Albanian private media outlet on Friday said government health authorities have put heavy fines and asked it to close the television signal for not respecting the social distancing in its shows. The RTV Ora News said the State Health Inspectorate put two heavy fines of 1 million Albanian leks each (16,000 euros in total) and then ordered it to close its activity after two of its anchormen held shows with three persons from the maximum of two persons allowed from rules set from the start of the country's lockdown to contain the coronavirus. 'They are not closing the business but the free speech,' said its top editor Brahim Shima. The State Health Inspectorate did not respond to the phone calls. Albania set strict rules after shutting down all its borders and the local businesses, also amending its penal code for violators of those rules with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment. The coronavirus pandemic in Albania has killed 31 people and has infected 900 confirmed cases as of Friday. Tourists are once again roaming portions of Grand Canyon National Park after some areas reopened Friday, despite concerns that it could hurt efforts to control the coronavirus. During the early morning, more than two dozen people were enjoying some viewpoints along the South Rim. Park officials said the South Rim entrance will only be open until 10 a.m. through Monday. Visitors will have limited access to viewpoints and other sites. Officials on the hard-hit Navajo Nation, which stretches into northern Arizona, expressed disappointment at the reopening. There have been at least 3,632 positive cases and 127 deaths on the reservation, which also includes portions of New Mexico and Utah. ___ LONDON -- British Health Secretary Matt Hancock says all care home residents and staff in England will have been tested for the coronavirus by early June, following days of criticism of the government over the scale of the epidemic in care homes.  The government said another 384 people who tested positive for COVID-19 have died in all settings, including care homes, taking the total to 33,998. That's the highest death toll in Europe and second only to the U.S.  Government scientists also said their estimate for the reproduction rate of coronavirus \u2014 the so-called R value \u2014 has increased modestly as a result of the spread of the virus in care homes.  The R measures how many people on average one infected person transmits the disease to. Because of lag factors involved in measuring infections, it's based on what occurred two to three weeks back. The R is thought to have risen to between 0.7 and 1 from the previous range of 0.5 and 0.9 .___ PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island sued Friday, seeking the release of dozens of detainees at a federal lockup where a lawyer says the coronavirus is spreading 'uncontrollably.'  The number of detainees testing positive has more than doubled in recent days at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls from 15 to 38, the ACLU said. Ten staff members have also tested positive.  The lockup holds as many as 770 inmates in the custody of agencies including the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but it's not clear how many are currently there. The ACLU argues detainees can't follow social distancing guidelines in small cells.  'The alarming news is that COVID-19 is spreading uncontrollably at the Wyatt,' lawyer Deborah Gonzalez said. Spokespeople for ICE and the lockup declined to comment on the lawsuit but said additional testing and monitoring is possible. Three ICE detainees were already released after a prior ACLU lawsuit. ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Friday that he's hopeful to have a coronavirus vaccine on the market by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive who Trump has tapped to serve as the administration's virus czar, said that early trial data suggests that 'a few hundred million doses of vaccine' will be delivered by late 2020. Trump, speaking at a Rose Garden event, reiterated that he wants to see states move forward with reopening their economies. 'We are back, vaccine or no vaccine,' Trump said. ___ BRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union and Spain say they are convening a donor conference this month in support of refugees and migrants from Venezuela as the coronavirus pandemic deepens their plight. Venezuela is gripped by a deepening political and economic crisis under President Nicols Maduro. Refugee agencies have said that the number of people fleeing the country could reach 6.5 million by the end of 2020. Most stay in Latin America and the Caribbean In a statement Friday, the EU said the aim of the May 26 event is to 'mobilize resources to support the displaced population and the main host communities, tackle the aggravated situation created by COVID-19, and facilitate greater commitment and coordination of the key actors.' The EU fears the crisis is being ignored but hopes that around 40 countries as well as UN agencies and world financial institutions will take part. Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzlez Laya says 'the international community cannot remain aloof from the drama of the Venezuelan exodus. It is necessary to act without further delay.' ___ NEW YORK -- After two months of strict limits on business and social distancing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo welcomed the first loosening of restrictions in many parts of the state Friday and announced that beaches would be allowed to open in time for the Memorial Day weekend. State and municipal beaches throughout the state will be allowed to open the Friday before the holiday, but with limits, the Democrat said. Capacity will be limited to no more than 50 percent of normal, with parking limited to trim crowds. Group activities will not be allowed. Picnic areas and playgrounds will stay closed. Employees need to wear masks. It will be up to local governments, Cuomo said, to decide whether to allow municipal beaches to reopen. If they do, they must follow the state's rules. 'If there is a problem, and the locals do not enforce those regulations, we will close those beaches,' Cuomo said. Beaches in New Jersey and Connecticut will also be open for the holiday weekend, and Cuomo said part of the rationale for reopening was to prevent New Yorkers from flocking to those states as the weather warms. ___ NEW YORK -- New York City will spend $55 million to provide 74,000 free air conditioners to low-income older adults who may be cooped up inside their apartments all summer because of the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. 'Knowing that low-income seniors are the most vulnerable, we're going to start an initiative right away to get them air conditioners,' de Blasio said. Other measures aimed at helping New Yorkers survive summer in the era of social distancing will include setting up air-conditioned cooling centers in facilities such as gyms and libraries and opening fire hydrants safely. 'This is all about protecting New Yorkers and helping them through the summer,' de Blasio said. ___ LONDON -- Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has confirmed that the lockdown restrictions in his country will start to be eased from Monday. Varadkar said in a tweet that it is 'safe to proceed' with the first stage in the government's plan to ease the restrictions. Earlier this month, the Irish government set out a road map of how to reopen society. Each one of the five stages will be staggered three weeks apart. From Monday, groups of up to four people, who can be family or friends, may meet outdoors within 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) of home. And some workers, such as those in construction, can return to their jobs, while the rules on exercise have been relaxed. And garden centers, as well as other primarily outdoor retail businesses, will be able to reopen. Social distancing rules have to be observed in all cases. Ireland is widely seen as having controlled the virus relatively well. The government has said that 1,506 people who tested positive for COVID-19 have died. ___ ROME \u2014 Italy registered an increase of 789 COVID-19 infections from Thursday to Friday as the country anxiously waits to learn if partial easing of lockdown restrictions earlier this month has triggered any uptick in contagion rate.  Other Health Ministry figures released on Friday evening indicated the number of patients needing intensive care in hospitals has continued to steadily decline. Currently 808 people with coronavirus infections occupy ICU beds in Italy. Early in the outbreak, ICU units were overwhelmed in the north, Italy's epicenter for coronavirus cases, helping to sharply drive up the number of deaths. Italy's known death toll by Friday evening stood at 31,610, after 242 deaths were registered in the last 24 hours. Overall, Italy has registered 223,885 cases since the nation's outbreak began in late February.  On May 4, the government loosened some lockdown rules, including allowing citizens to frequent public parks and to visit family members throughout their home region. Epidemiologists have said that it would take roughly 14 days to assess whether the regained partial freedom of movement might send Italy's infection rate climbing again. Meanwhile, more restrictions are expected to be lifted or loosened throughout the country starting next week. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.15\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.15</url> Stocks that Insiders Love[1]An insider trade occurs when a corporate executive (such as a CEO, CFO or COO) that has non-public information about a company buys or sells shares of that company's stock. Company insiders are required by law to regularly report their stock purchases and sales to the SEC.Tracking a company's insider trades is a metric that can be used to identify the direction that the company's executives believes that the company is headed. If a number of insiders purchase more shares of their company, they may believe that the company will have strong future earnings and that the share price will increase in the near future.For example, if Microsoft's CEO, CFO and COO all recently purchased additional shares of Microsoft stock, that would be an indication that there could be unreported news that may positively effect Microsoft's stock price in the near future.This slideshow lists the 15 companies that have had the highest levels of insider buying within the last 180 days.View the \"15 Stocks that Insiders Love\"[2].

Montenegrin health authorities said late Wednesday they have registered seven new cases after two more were confirmed earlier this week. A country of some 620,000 people, Montenegro imposed strict lockdown measures during the outbreak. Montenegro recently started reopening, hoping to attract tourists to the Adriatic coast. </p><p>___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 Race for virus vaccine could leave some countries behind \u2014 Study ties blood type to COVID-19 risk; O may help, A hurt \u2014 NASA's next Mars rover honors medical teams fighting virus \u2014 A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin says special tunnels have been installed to protect Putin from the coronavirus at home and at work.

President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a national address that 21 women and children have been killed since the start of the month.  \u2014 U.S. health regulators are issuing warnings to three companies selling at-home blood tests for coronavirus.

The governors of Istanbul, Ankara and Bursa announced the mask rule late Wednesday in line with a recommendation by the country's scientific advisory council. Masks are obligatory in 47 out of 81 provinces. The statements said masks must be worn in all public spaces.  Turkey is seeing an upward trend in the daily number of infections after the government authorized cafes, restaurants, gyms, parks, beaches and museums to reopen, lifted inter-city travel restrictions and eased stay-at-home orders for the elderly and young at the start of June. Turkey has reported 182,727 confirmed cases and 4,861 deaths from COVID-19 since March. ___ ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Greek civil protection authorities have imposed a seven-day complete lockdown on a community in northeastern Greece, after a spike in coronavirus cases there over the past week. Residents of the Echinos community in the province of Xanthi are forbidden from leaving the area, and are under a 24-hour curfew. They can leave their homes only to buy food or medication, and must wear a mask. Only vehicles resupplying food stores and pharmacies are allowed into Echinos, while all other retail businesses have been shut. The community has been the source of a localized outbreak before too. Authorities said the area had registered 73 new coronavirus cases and four deaths over the past week. Health officials are intensifying testing in the area. Greece had imposed a lockdown early and has managed to maintain deaths and serious illness from the coronavirus at low levels. On Wednesday, the country announced 55 new cases, the highest daily number for weeks The vast majority were in Xanthi. Greece has had a total of 187 deaths and just over 3,200 confirmed cases in the country of nearly 11 million people. ___ BEIJING \u2014 A Beijing government spokesman says the city has recorded a total of 158 confirmed cases since the new outbreak was detected last week at a large wholesale market. Hu Hejian says close contacts are being traced to locate all possible cases as quickly as possible amid strengthened testing and other prevention and control measures. Anyone who has been near the Xinfad market since May 30, along with their close contacts, will be quarantined at home for 14 days and tested at least twice, said city government official Zhang Ge. Beijing reported 21 cases Thursday, down from 31 a day earlier. Beijing has barred entry to all confirmed and suspected cases, patients with fever and close contacts from abroad and other provinces, Zhang said. China also has barred most foreigners from entering and even foreign diplomats arriving from abroad must undergo two weeks of home quarantine. All indoor public venues remain closed, Zhang said. Offices, restaurants and hotels in high risk area also will be shut down, he said. ___ NEW DELHI: India recorded the highest one-day spike of 12,281 coronavirus cases, raising the total to 366,946 even as the government ruled out reimposing a countrywide lockdown. India's death toll reached 12,237, a rise of 334 in the past 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry. The number of recoveries touched 52% at 194,325. India stands behind the United States, Brazil and Russia in the number of cases. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday rejected media reports that the government was considering reimposing lockdown. India has to think about further unlocking, minimizing all possibilities of harm to people, he said. The March 25 lockdown is now restricted to high-risk areas. The worst-hit states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and New Delhi.  ___ ISLAMABAD \u2014 Pakistan has reported 5,358 new coronavirus cases, pushing infections in the Middle East beyond 1 million. Cases in Pakistan have been spiraling in recent weeks, crossing 160,000 on Thursday even as Prime Minister Imran Khan has resisted pleas from medical professionals and the World Health Organization to reimpose a strict lockdown for at least two weeks. Khan says a countrywide lockdown would devastate an already crumbling economy and hurt the poorest with unemployment expected to near 7 million. Economists say Pakistan's poverty rate of 30% has increased to 40% since the first lockdown was imposed in mid-March. Khan's critics say a series of missteps has worsened the epidemic in Pakistan, beginning with his refusal to shut down mosques, particularly in April and May during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan followed by Eid-al Fitr, a holiday that brought millions of Pakistanis into overcrowded markets.  ___ SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 59 COVID-19 cases as infections steadily rise in the capital area where half the country's 51 million people live. The figures announced Thursday by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bring the national caseload to 12,257, including 280 deaths. The agency says 39 of the new cases are in Seoul and the surrounding region, where authorities are trying to stem transmissions amid increased economic activity and eased attitudes on social distancing. Eight new cases were linked to international arrivals. Officials are concerned the resurgence of the virus in China could bring more imported cases. South Korea has tied at least 1,379 cases to international arrivals and is requiring two-week quarantines on all passengers arriving from abroad. ___ CANBERRA, Australia \u2014 The two universities in Australia's capital plan to fly in 350 foreign students as the country's international education sector reopens after the coronavirus lockdown. Australian National University and Canberra University said Thursday they expect the chartered aircraft to fly to Canberra from Singapore in late July. Priority will be given to students involved in research that can't be done online. The students will be quarantined at a hotel for two weeks. They are likely to be the first foreign students to return to Australian campuses since the lockdown. Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Sydney Radio 2GB he supports the universities' plan. Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham says it's likely Australia won't allow general international travel before next year. ___ BEIJING \u2014 China's capital has reported a decline in newly confirmed coronavirus cases as the city continues to press stricter measures to contain a new outbreak. Beijing reported 21 cases Thursday, down from 31 a day earlier. Officials reported 28 new cases in all nationwide. Of the cases outside Beijing, four were brought by Chinese travelers from outside the country and three were reported in the city of Tianjin and Hebei province, both of which border Beijing. No new deaths were reported, leaving the total number of fatalities at 4,634. Beijing this week moved to suspend classes and restrict tourism and travel in and out of the city to stem any further spread in the latest outbreak traced to the city's largest wholesale market.10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy After the Market's Historic Sell-Off[1]Technology stocks are among the most volatile in the market. The allure of big gains comes with the risk of sharp downturns. When the market is trending upwards, these stocks have a tendency to lead the way. Conversely, when the market is selling off, tech stocks post some of the largest losses. And in the coronavirus crash tech stocks took their usual beating. But an interesting dynamic is happening. As stocks are trying to stage a comeback, many tech stocks are being left behind. Many of the leading tech stocks trade on the NASDAQ exchange. However, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&amp;#38;P 500 posted gains on March 25, the NASDAQ stayed down. And that's an opportunity for investors who know where to look. We've put together this presentation to give you ten technology stocks that look to be solid bets no matter which way the market moves. Some of the stocks you'll see are companies that have a business model that is perfectly suited for today's social distancing environment.

The number of daily new cases started to rapidly grow this month in Russia, which had earlier lifted most of the virus-related restrictions and resumed air traffic with several countries. (AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky) MOSCOW \u2014 Coronavirus infections in Russia hit a new record on Sunday, with the government reporting over 10,000 new confirmed cases for the first time since mid-May. The 10,499 new cases reported on Sunday bring the country's total to over 1.2 million. </p><p>Russia currently has the fourth largest caseload in the world and has so far reported over 21,000 deaths. The Russian authorities insist there are no plans to impose a second lockdown in the country that has lifted most of the virus-related restrictions imposed in the spring. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday another lockdown is currently not being discussed in the government. At the same time in Moscow, which reported over 3,000 new cases on Sunday in the biggest surge in months, officials have recommended the elderly to self-isolate at home and have extended upcoming school holidays by a week. On Thursday, Moscow mayor also ordered employers to have at least 30% of their staff work from home.  ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 Doctor: Trump improving, but not 'out of the woods' yet \u2014 Analysis: Trump faces credibility crisis over health scare \u2014 Pence ordered borders closed due to pandemic after CDC experts refused \u2014 South Africa and India have asked the World Trade Organization to waive provisions on intellectual property rights to speed efforts to prevent, treat and contain the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2014 Madrid, Europe's most critical coronavirus hot spot, is under a partial lockdown, with police controlling travel in and out of the city. Still some flamenco houses reopened, with precautions. ___ Follow AP's pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url> (Ad) Gold values soar as investors flock to the 1,000%+ potential of gold stocks amid the COVID crisis. Here's a small-cap explorer that's deploying a proven strategy that's so lucrative, it recently sold an interest in one of its properties to a global producer for over C$25 million in cash and stock. ___ HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: WASHINGTON __ President Donald Trump went through a 'very concerning' period Friday and faces a 'critical' next two days in his fight against COVID-19 at a military hospital, his chief of staff said Saturday \u2014 in contrast to a rosier assessment moments earlier by Trump doctors, who took pains not to reveal the president had received supplemental oxygen at the White House before his hospital admission. Trump remained at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Sunday. He offered his own assessment of his status Saturday evening in a video from his hospital suite, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to 'be back soon.' Hours earlier, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters, 'We're still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.' In an update Saturday night, Trump's chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was 'not yet out of the woods.' The changing, and at times contradictory, accounts created a credibility crisis for the White House at a crucial moment. With Trump expected to remain hospitalized several more days and the presidential election looming, his condition is being anxiously watched by Americans. \u2014- JERUSALEM \u2014 A member of Israel's Cabinet has tested positive for the coronavirus as the country remains under lockdown while battling a second wave of infection. Gila Gamliel, Israel's environmental protection minister and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, announced on Twitter Sunday that she had tested positive. She was the fourth minister in Israel's government to test positive. 'I feel good and hope to recover quickly with God's help,' she wrote on social media. The Israeli government imposed a nationwide lockdown on Sept. 18 ahead of the Jewish High Holidays in an effort to rein in a runaway outbreak of the coronavirus. According to Health Ministry figures, Israel has recorded over 264,000 cases and almost 1,700 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. ___ WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. -- The Navajo Nation, which sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, reported 17 new coronavirus cases and no new deaths Saturday. The total number of deaths related to the virus on the huge reservation remains at 558, and the total number of cases is now 10,421. ___ NEW DELHI \u2014 India has registered 75,829 confirmed coronaviruses cases in the past 24 hours, a day after crossing 100,000 fatalities. The Health Ministry raised India's confirmed total to more than 6.5 million on Sunday and said at least 101,782 people have died of COVID-19. India is still registering the highest number of daily cases globally but with the recovery rate at more than 83%, the number of those cured has surpassed 5.5 million, the Health Ministry said, crediting increased testing. India is preparing to reopen cinemas and entertainment parks with limited capacity beginning Oct. 15, in an effort to revive the economy. Health experts warn the move has the potential for the virus to spread during the upcoming religious festival and winter season. ___ RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014A very small, limited number of people donning the white terrycloth garment symbolic of the Muslim pilgrimage circled Islam's holiest site in Mecca on Sunday after Saudi Arabia lifted coronavirus restrictions that had been in place for months. The kingdom had taken the rare step of suspending the smaller 'umrah' pilgrimage that draws millions year-round from across the world in early March as the coronavirus morphed into a global pandemic and prompted countries to impose lockdowns and curfews to slow down transmission.  But as nations begin to ease those restrictions, the Saudi government on Sunday started allowing a maximum of 6,000 pilgrims a day to enter the sprawling Grand Mosque in Mecca. Only Saudi citizens and residents will be permitted to enter the mosque during this first phase of reopening, and each person has up to three hours to complete the pilgrimage.  \u2014- MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 The premier of Australia's Victoria state has called on citizens to 'stay the course' after large groups flooded beaches and parks at the weekend in defiance of strict lockdown regulations. Victoria, emerging from a major winter spike in coronavirus cases, relaxed lockdown regulations last weekend but still allowed only five people from up to two households to congregate outside. Many ignored those regulations on Saturday and crowded parks and beaches, causing Premier Daniel Andrews to remind Victorians not to be selfish and maintain social distancing. Victoria reported only 12 new coronavirus cases and one death Sunday, well down on the peaks of winter. Andrews said the situation in Victoria is 'delicately poised' as the state moves toward further easing of lockdown rules. 'People love to go to the beach when it's sunny but there's a global pandemic on,' he said. 'Surely, there's a greater urge to see this thing, to defeat it and to have a normal summer and have a COVID normal Christmas and 2021.' ___ SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 64 new cases of the coronavirus, the fourth straight day its increase came below 100, possibly reflecting the fewer number of tests conducted during one of the biggest holidays of the year. The figures released by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Sunday brought the national caseload to 24,091, including 421 deaths. Thirty-eight of the new cases were reported from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area. Health workers have struggled to track transmissions tied to churches, hospitals, schools and offices. Seventeen of the new cases were linked to international arrivals. There are concerns that infections could rise in coming weeks because of increased travel during the five-day Chuseok harvest holiday that continues through Sunday. ___ SANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 New Mexico officials have reported 298 additional known COVID-19 cases and three more deaths, increasing the statewide totals to 30,296 cases with 890 deaths. The additional cases reported Saturday included 75 in Bernalillo County, 67 in Dona Ana County, 32 in Chaves County, 22 in Lea County and 20 in Curry County. The three deaths occurred one each in Bernalillo, Curry and Dona Ana counties and involving people in their 70s or 80s with underlying conditions. ___ PHOENIX \u2014 Numerous inmates say Arizona's prison system has failed to provide necessary testing, supplies and treatment during the coronavirus pandemic.  The Arizona Republic reports that dozens of letters from inmates in recent months said the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry wasn't protecting staff and inmates during the outbreak.  The Republic reports inmates' letters describing fears and frustrations, asking for help while others provided graphic details in personal narratives of surviving the virus.  A department spokesperson denied many allegations by inmates, including that sick inmates weren't tested. Department spokesperson Judy Keane also cited health and safety protocols announced during the pandemic. ___ LONDON \u2014 Britain has recorded 12,872 new coronavirus infections, by far the highest daily total since the outbreak began, though the figure includes a backlog of previously unreported cases. The government says the figure includes an unspecified number of deaths over the past week that have not been reported because of a now-resolved 'technical issue.' Saturday's total is more than 5,000 cases more than the previous high, recorded earlier this week. Britain is seeing a second spike in coronavirus cases, though the daily number can't directly be compared to the outbreak's U.K. peak in April because many more tests are now being performed. The number of hospitalizations and deaths is also rising but remains far below the U.K.'s springtime peak. Another 49 COVID-19 deaths were reported on Saturday. Britain's official coronavirus death toll is 42,317, the highest in Europe. The government has imposed restrictions on social gatherings to try and curb the spread of the virus, and almost a third of the country's population of 66 million is under tighter local lockdown measures. ___ NEW YORK \u2014 New York state's daily count of new coronavirus cases is continuing to rise. The state reported on Saturday there were more than 1,700 new confirmed cases on Friday, up slightly from the day before with case totals not seen since May. Some of the hot spots in the state included the New York City borough of Brooklyn, where more than 350 people tested positive, and in suburban Rockland County, which saw at least 120 new cases. 7 Tech Stocks To Buy On Sale[1]This too shall pass. Those four words should be taped to the computer screen of every investor. If you own shares of the tech sector, you've seen your portfolio take quite a hit. Tech stocks were largely immune from the effects of the pandemic. However, as investors are looking to rebalance their portfolios, tech stocks were obvious targets for some profit-taking. And at the end of the day, that's what I believe the latest tech selloff amounts to. Stocks don't move in one direction all the time. Sure, there may be some saber-rattling about breaking up big tech. But with an election in less than two months, nobody will have the political will to do anything. That doesn't mean that it's all going to be smooth sailing. Sure, the Federal Reserve did its part by promising low-interest rates until the end of time (or at least through 2023 whatever comes first). But the rest of 2020 is likely to be volatile for stocks. First, there's still the novel coronavirus hanging around. It's not going to simply disappear after election day. That will take some combination of a vaccine and/or therapeutic. And all the likely candidates seem to be getting farther away the deeper into clinical trials they get. And we have an election. But we are not likely to know the winner of the election on election night. In fact, for those who remember the spectacle of 'hanging chads', this election could make that one look like amateur hour. The bottom line is there will be uncertainty. But there are always gains to be found, particularly now that their stock price has come down a little bit. Here are seven tech stocks that you can look to add or increase a position in now that they're trading at a discount. View the \"7 Tech Stocks To Buy On Sale\"[2].

South Dakota, Idaho and Iowa are seeing sky-high rates of tests coming back positive. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)SIOUX FALLS, S.D. \u2014 South Dakota health officials have reported all-time highs for the toll of the coronavirus with 13 deaths and 747 more people who tested positive. State epidemiologist Josh Clayton says communities statewide \u2014 from cities to rural areas \u2014 are seeing significant levels of the virus. </p><p>He noted that 245 of the infections reported were backlogged from previous days after a reporting error. One of the largest outbreaks came from a women's prison in Pierre as mass testing revealed that 29 more women in one housing unit had the virus. A total of 197 prisoners and staff have tested positive and 110 have recovered. ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 Push to bring coronavirus vaccines to the poor faces trouble  \u2014 In Appalachia, people watch COVID-19, race issues from afar \u2014 NFL postpones Steelers-Titans game after more positive tests \u2014 The White House is backing a $400 per week pandemic jobless benefit and possible COVID-19 relief bill with a price tag above $1.5 trillion. \u2014 France's health minister is threatening to close bars and ban family gatherings, if the rise in virus cases doesn't improve.  \u2014 Americans seeking unemployment benefits declined last week to a still-high 837,000, suggesting the economy is struggling to sustain a tentative recovery from the summer. ___ Follow AP's pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url> ___ HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 A mask mandate in Tulsa is being expanded and extended in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The amended measure lowers the age of those who must wear face coverings from 18 and up to those older than 10. It also extends through Jan. 31 the mandate for masks to be worn in public when social distancing is not possible. Previously it was to expire Nov. 30 (Ad) The coronavirus knocked the wind out of stocks. And while no one can predict what could possibly happen next, there's no shortage of top blood in the street stock opportunities to start considering right now.  President Donald Trump held an indoor campaign rally in Tulsa on June 20 that attracted about 6,000 attendees as well as protesters. Local Health Department director Bruce Dart said later that the event 'likely contributed' to a sharp surge in new coronavirus cases. As of Thursday, Oklahoma's state health department has recorded 88,369 virus cases and 1,035 deaths due to COVID-19, increases of 1,170 and four, respectively, from the previous day. ___ DENVER \u2014 Colorado's deadliest workplace coronavirus outbreak has been declared resolved after five months, 291 cases and six deaths.  The determination regarding the outbreak at the JBS meatpacking plant in Greeley was made by the state Department of Public Health and Environment after there were no new cases for at least 28 days and an investigation was completed.  The announcement comes as families of some JBS employees who died say their worker's compensation claims have been denied.  JBS argues that their infections were not work-related. The plant did not respond to requests for comment by Colorado Public Radio. ___ PHOENIX \u2014 Arizona is reporting 705 additional COVID-19 cases and 24 more deaths as health officials say all 15 counties have cleared state benchmarks for partial reopening of certain businesses. The overall statewide total of confirmed cases is now 219,212 cases, and the death toll 5,674. Arizona's Department of Health Services says the classification of largely rural Graham County improved to 'moderate transmission stage.' That made it the final county to meet criteria for reopening businesses such as indoor gyms, bars serving food and movie theaters. One county, tiny Greenlee in southeastern Arizona, is at 'minimal' status, the highest step below normal conditions. ___ HELENA, Mont. \u2014 Nearly half Montana's confirmed COVID-19 cases came in September as the state continues to report record numbers of infections.  The state reported 429 cases Thursday, the highest daily total by a margin of 81. Overall there were just over 6,000 in September, or 44% of the 13,500 since mid-March.  The true numbers are thought to be much higher because not everyone has been tested, and studies show people can have COVID-19 without experiencing symptoms. ___ BOISE, Idaho \u2014 Idaho will remain in the fourth and final stage of Gov. Brad Little's economic-reopening plan for at least another two weeks as coronavirus infections and deaths rise. The Republican governor says Idaho will receive 530,000 rapid antigen tests that will be prioritized for schools. Little also announced Thursday the formation of a COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee in anticipation of a vaccine that would be distributed by the federal government. Stage 4 of Idaho's plan allows most businesses to open.  ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. health officials say hospitals bought only about a third of the doses of remdesivir that they were offered over the last few months to treat COVID-19, as the government stops overseeing the drug's distribution. Between July and September, 500,000 treatment courses were made available to state and local health departments but only about 161,000 were purchased. Dr. John Redd of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday that 'we see this as a very good sign' that supply now outstrips demand and it's OK for hospitals to start buying the drug, also known as Veklury, directly from maker Gilead Sciences Inc. The government will buy some of the excess for the national stockpile.  Several studies suggest remdesivir can shorten time to recovery and hospital stays by four days on average. At $3,200 per treatment course, its price might be playing a role in the low demand.  ___ LONDON \u2014 A British lawmaker has apologized for travelling to London to attend a coronavirus debate in Parliament despite having COVID-19 symptoms. She also took a train home to Scotland after getting a positive test. The Scottish National Party suspended Margaret Ferrier after she said that 'there is no excuse for my actions' and that she had reported herself to police.  People in Britain are told they must self-isolate if they have COVID-10 symptoms and while they are waiting for a test result. Also Thursday, Stanley Johnson, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's father, apologized after he was photographed shopping without a face covering.  Britain's government recently raised fines for not wearing masks in places like stores in a bid to curb a spike in infections. ___ HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 A Republican state lawmaker's positive test for the coronavirus has prompted legislative leaders to cancel the Pennsylvania House's voting session. Human resources workers were deployed to trace Rep. Paul Schemel's personal contacts to see if others should be quarantined.  He was most recently in the Capitol on Tuesday, and it's unclear if he wore a mask while in the building's public spaces.  ___ MADRID \u2014 Spain's health ministry has reported 9,419 new coronavirus cases as the country struggles to control Europe's most worrisome flare-up. The ministry says 3,715 of the cases were diagnosed in the last 24 hours. The remainder were from previous days but not reported to central authorities until now. Spain leads Europe with more than 778,600 cases. The ministry reported another 182 confirmed deaths, increasing the total to 31,973. ___ NEW YORK \u2014 Schools across New York report that at least 1,200 students and staff have tested positive for the coronavirus since the start of the academic year. As of Tuesday, 693 public and private schools had reported at least one infection. Around 700 students and 400 school staff have tested positive. State officials note the count doesn't capture the full extent of infections among schoolchildren. A separate data system operated by state health officials has documented around 2,300 infections among school-age children since Sept. 1.  The district is rolling out a monthly plan to test students and staff. Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city plans more than 100,000 tests on students a month, at a cost of $78-$90 a piece.  ___ LAS CRUCES, N.M. \u2014 New Mexico State University will move classes entirely online after the Thanksgiving break and the college's fall commencement will not be held.  The Las Cruces Sun-News reports University President John Floros says the university surveyed students, faculty and staff at the Las Cruces campus about returning following the break, when there will be two weeks left in the fall semester. The campus will remain open to provide housing, dining and other services. The college plans to return to in-person classes after winter break. ___ BEIRUT \u2014 Syrian state media report the country has reopened the capital's main airport for international flights amid tight coronavirus measures.  The Damascus International Airport had been closed since early March, though some flights have brought home Syrians stranded outside the country. Syria has 4,200 confirmed coronavirus cases and 200 deaths in government-held areas. Scores more cases have been registered in northern areas outside government control. ___ CHICAGO \u2014 Add ballet in Chicago to the list of things called off because of the pandemic. The Joffrey Ballet of Chicago says it has canceled its entire 2020-21 season, which runs through spring. The Joffrey says the decision will cost it more than $9 million in lost box office receipts.  A philanthropic fund called the Joffrey Crisis Stabilization has been set up with a goal of raising $12 million, with some $9 million already raised. ___ MILAN \u2014 Italy has tallied 2,548 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily total in five months. Health authorities tested more than 118,000 people, a 10% increase from a day earlier.  Nearly 3,100 people are hospitalized, with 291 in intensive care. Italy has averaged 1,500 daily cases since schools reopened three weeks ago. The nation has reached 317,409 cases and nearly 36,000 confirmed deaths.  ___ COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Police say several parties and large gatherings coinciding with the University of South Carolina's season-opening football game were broken up.  Columbia Police told The State newspaper Wednesday that three citations and four warnings were issued to residences that house some USC students.  The largest gathering was at an apartment complex near the Gamecocks' Williams-Brice stadium, where about 300 people got together Saturday after the game. ___ HILO, Hawaii \u2014 A Hawaii food bank is now serving up to 80,000 people monthly.  That's up from about 14,000 at this time last year, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports Food Basket executive director Kristin Frost Albrecht says the group helps residents through a network of partner agencies and programs.  The organization serves between 2,000 and 3,700 people at each of its Big Island sites, and 80% to 85% of them are unemployed. Albrecht says there have been numerous donations, including food contributed by farmers. ___ ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Maryland is reporting zero coronavirus deaths in a 24-hour period for the first time since March 28.  That doesn't necessarily mean no COVID-19 deaths occurred in that time frame, because sometimes there is a delay in the submission of a death certificate.  Still, Gov. Larry Hogan says it's an 'encouraging milestone' and a tribute to the efforts of health care workers. ___ LONDON \u2014 The European Medicines Agency has begun its first review process for an experimental COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The EU regulator says it started a 'rolling review' process it hopes will expedite any eventual approval.  The EMA has begun analyzing preliminary information from scientists on the Oxford vaccine that suggest it 'triggers the production of antibodies and T-Cells,' referring to immune system cells that target the virus.  The agency says it was waiting for data from ongoing late-stage tests of the vaccine involving thousands of people, which it hopes will be shared in the coming months. The Oxford vaccine is proceeding with a large U.K. trial even though a similar study has been halted in the U.S. while the FDA examines the report of a serious neurological side effect in a British trial participant. ___ ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Police in Greece have used tear gas to disperse protesting high school students who organized school strikes in response to classroom overcrowding during the pandemic. Brief clashes broke out near parliament in central Athens after students threw several gasoline bombs at police. No arrests or injuries were reported. Greece's largest teaching union endorsed the rally and pressed the government to hire more teachers to reduce classroom numbers. Authorities are struggling with a recent rise in COVID-19 cases in the capital, where residents of a nursing home were evacuated and some hospitalized.  ___ ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkey's government is being accused of hiding the true extent of the coronavirus outbreak after the health minister revealed that daily figures reflect only symptomatic patients and not all positive cases.  Minister Fahrettin Koca said late Wednesday that since July 29, Turkey has been reporting the number of coronavirus patients being cared for in hospitals or homes. The count didn't include asymptomatic positive cases, he said.  The revelation led to an outcry on social media. Overall, Turkey has reported 318,000 cases and 8,195 deaths. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 Russian health officials are reporting nearly 9,000 new coronavirus cases, one of the largest increases in months.  The 8,945 cases are almost twice as many as officials were registering in late August and bring the country's total to more 1.18 million, fourth highest in the world. There have been 20,796 confirmed deaths \u2014 12th highest globally \u2014 according to Johns Hopkins University. Authorities have repeatedly dismissed a second lockdown or other major restrictions. Moscow officials last week asked older adults to stay at home and employers to let people work remotely, however. The city's mayor also extended school holidays starting Oct. 5 to two weeks.

Those four words should be taped to the computer screen of every investor. If you own shares of the tech sector, you've seen your portfolio take quite a hit. Tech stocks were largely immune from the effects of the pandemic. However, as investors are looking to rebalance their portfolios, tech stocks were obvious targets for some profit-taking. And at the end of the day, that's what I believe the latest tech selloff amounts to. Stocks don't move in one direction all the time. Sure, there may be some saber-rattling about breaking up big tech. But with an election in less than two months, nobody will have the political will to do anything. That doesn't mean that it's all going to be smooth sailing. Sure, the Federal Reserve did its part by promising low-interest rates until the end of time (or at least through 2023 whatever comes first). But the rest of 2020 is likely to be volatile for stocks. First, there's still the novel coronavirus hanging around. It's not going to simply disappear after election day. That will take some combination of a vaccine and/or therapeutic. And all the likely candidates seem to be getting farther away the deeper into clinical trials they get. And we have an election. But we are not likely to know the winner of the election on election night. In fact, for those who remember the spectacle of 'hanging chads', this election could make that one look like amateur hour. The bottom line is there will be uncertainty. But there are always gains to be found, particularly now that their stock price has come down a little bit. Here are seven tech stocks that you can look to add or increase a position in now that they're trading at a discount. View the \"7 Tech Stocks To Buy On Sale\"[4].

Seoul city temporarily banned outdoor rallies with 10 or more people over infection risks against the spread of the coronavirus. South Korea's new coronavirus daily tally has remained in two digits for a third straight day as authorities called for public vigilance during one of the country's biggest holidays. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 73 new cases of the coronavirus, its fifth straight day of below 100, although officials expressed concern that could rise because of increased travel during a five-day holiday period that ended Sunday. </p><p>The figures released by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency Monday brought the national caseload to 24,164, including 422 deaths. Fifty-one of the new cases were reported from the greater capital area, where health workers have scrambled to stem transmissions tied to various places, including churches, hospitals, schools, restaurants and workplaces. The newest cluster of infections in the region is an army unit in Pocheon, north of capital Seoul, where more than 30 troops have so far tested positive. The KDCA said nine of the new cases were linked to international arrivals, including passengers from the United States, Poland, Britain, Russia and Uzbekistan. There's a possibility that the downward trend in confirmed infections is related to the fewer tests that were conducted during the five-day Chuseok harvest holiday. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo during a virus briefing Monday urged people who experience fever or other symptoms after traveling during the period get tested immediately. Park said usage of express buses and rail services declined by more than 40% during the holiday break compared to last year as officials pleaded that people stay home to help slow transmissions. ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 Virus spreads on panel handling U.S. Supreme Court nomination. \u2014 Pope: Market capitalism has failed in pandemic, needs reform. \u2014 South African coffin-maker saw COVID-19 at work and at home. \u2014 South Africa and India have asked the World Trade Organization to waive provisions on intellectual property rights to speed efforts to prevent, treat and contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

Already several individual regions have imposed outdoor mask mandates in a bid to curb the rebound in infections. On Sunday, Italy added another 2,578 confirmed cases, far fewer new daily infections than in neighboring France or Spain, but cause for concern in the onetime European epicenter of the pandemic. Another 18 people died, bringing Italy's toll to 35,986, the second highest in Europe after Britain. Health Minister Roberto Speranza told RAI 3 television a national outdoor mask mandate was being considered by the government in a bid to keep infections from spiraling out of control now that schools have reopened. There have been 900 cases tied to schools, and 14 school-based clusters in the last week alone. But health authorities said in their weekly monitoring report that it will still be some time before they know the full effect of schools reopening on the infection curve. ___ ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Greek health authorities announced 229 new coronavirus cases and 4 deaths Sunday. The total number of cases since the pandemic started is 19,842, with 409 deaths. There are 82 patients on ventilators. A health ministry expert said that, while people largely abide by the face mask and social distancing rules during the day, they largely ignore them at nights and this has helped fuel the rise in cases: about 80 percent of new COVID-19 cases have been registered over the past two months. Government experts say daily new cases must drop before colder weather sets in. \u2014- NEW YORK \u2014 New York City's mayor says he has asked the state for permission to close schools and reinstate restrictions on nonessential businesses in several neighborhoods because of a resurgence of the coronavirus. Shutdowns would happen starting Wednesday in nine zip codes in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio says about 300 public and private schools would have to close. Indoor dining, which just resumed a few days ago, would be suspended. Gyms would also close.  De Blasio said the city needed the state to sign off on the restrictions. Over the past two weeks, the number of new cases of the virus has been rising in pockets of the city. \u2014- LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but warned that the country faces a 'bumpy' winter ahead. Britain has Europe's highest coronavirus death toll, at more than 42,000, and Johnson's Conservative government is facing criticism from all sides. Opponents say tougher social restrictions are needed to suppress a second pandemic wave, but many in Johnson's own right-of-center party argue that restrictions must be eased to save the economy. Johnson told the BBC that the government had to strike a difficult balance and he couldn't 'take a course that could expose us to tens of thousands more deaths in very short order.' Johnson expressed hope that progress on vaccines and testing would 'change the scientific equation' in the next few months, allowing a return to normality. But he said 'it's going to continue to be bumpy through to Christmas. It may even be bumpy beyond.' Britain on Saturday reported a record 12,872 new coronavirus infections, by far the highest daily total since the outbreak began, though the figure included a backlog of previously unreported cases. \u2014- NEW DELHI \u2014 India says it is planning to immunize at least 250 million of its 1.4 billion people by July 2021 after receiving between 400 and 500 million coronavirus vaccine doses. Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said the government will ensure 'equitable access' to the vaccine and is in the process of identifying the high-risk groups that will be the first in line, including health care workers. India is testing three potential vaccines, including one being developed jointly by the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca. That will be mass produced by India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest vaccine producer. The Serum Institute has said it would produce 200 million doses of coronavirus vaccines for developing countries, including India. India has reported 6.5 million cases and more than 100,000 deaths in the pandemic. \u2014- MOSCOW \u2014 Coronavirus infections in Russia hit a new record on Sunday, with the government reporting over 10,000 new confirmed cases for the first time since mid-May. The 10,499 new cases reported on Sunday bring the country's total to over 1.2 million. Russia currently has the fourth largest caseload in the world and has so far reported over 21,000 deaths. The Russian authorities insist there are no plans to impose a second lockdown in the country that has lifted most of the virus-related restrictions imposed in the spring. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday another lockdown is currently not being discussed in the government. At the same time in Moscow, which reported over 3,000 new cases on Sunday in the biggest surge in months, officials have recommended the elderly to self-isolate at home and have extended upcoming school holidays by a week. \u2014- WASHINGTON __ President Donald Trump went through a 'very concerning' period Friday and faces a 'critical' next two days in his fight against COVID-19 at a military hospital, his chief of staff said Saturday \u2014 in contrast to a rosier assessment moments earlier by Trump doctors, who took pains not to reveal the president had received supplemental oxygen at the White House before his hospital admission. Trump remained at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Sunday. He offered his own assessment of his status Saturday evening in a video from his hospital suite, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to 'be back soon.' Hours earlier, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters, 'We're still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.' In an update Saturday night, Trump's chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was 'not yet out of the woods.' The changing, and at times contradictory, accounts created a credibility crisis for the White House at a crucial moment. With Trump expected to remain hospitalized several more days and the presidential election looming, his condition is being anxiously watched by Americans. \u2014- BRATISLAVA, Slovakia \u2014 Slovakia's record surge of new confirmed coronavirus cases has not slowed down despite tough restrictive measures, surpassing 800 new daily cases for the first time. The Health Ministry says the day-to-day increase reached a new record high of 818 on Saturday. The government has reacted to the recent spike by declaring a state of emergency accompanied by strict restrictions. Prime Minister Igor Matovic call3e on fellow Slovaks on Sunday to avoid any public gatherings and not to organize any family celebrations. 'We're heading for very difficult days,' Matovic said on Facebook. Slovakia has reported 13,139 virus infections and 55 deaths, still low numbers compared with other European countries. ___ JERUSALEM \u2014 A member of Israel's Cabinet has tested positive for the coronavirus as the country remains under lockdown while battling a second wave of infection. Gila Gamliel, Israel's environmental protection minister and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, announced on Twitter Sunday that she had tested positive. She was the fourth minister in Israel's government to test positive. The Israeli government imposed a nationwide lockdown on Sept. 18 ahead of the Jewish High Holidays in an effort to rein in a runaway outbreak of the coronavirus. According to Health Ministry figures, Israel has recorded over 264,000 cases and almost 1,700 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. ___ WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. -- The Navajo Nation, which sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, reported 17 new coronavirus cases and no new deaths Saturday. The total number of deaths related to the virus on the huge reservation remains at 558, and the total number of cases is now 10,421. ___ COLOMBO, Sri Lanka: Sri Lankan authorities closed schools countrywide and imposed a curfew Sunday in two suburbs in Western Province, after a person tested positive for the coronavirus. The person was being treated at a hospital for a fever when a coronavirus test came back positive. About 15 hospital staff and 40 co-workers have been put in self-quarantine. On Sunday, the Education Ministry announced that schools are closed from Oct 5 after the authorities decided to advance the school holidays to Oct. 5 from the scheduled date of Oct. 9.  The curfew imposed on Sunday covers Minuwangoda and Divulapitiya suburbs, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the capital Colombo, from where the patient was reported. For more than two months, health officials have been saying that they have prevented the community spread of the virus. The country has reported 3,388 confirmed cases, including 13 deaths. Of the total, 3,254 have recovered. ___ RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014A very small, limited number of people donning the white terrycloth garment symbolic of the Muslim pilgrimage circled Islam's holiest site in Mecca after Saudi Arabia lifted coronavirus restrictions that had been in place for months. The kingdom had taken the rare step of suspending the smaller 'umrah' pilgrimage that draws millions year-round from across the world in early March as the coronavirus morphed into a global pandemic. But as nations begin to ease those restrictions, the Saudi government on Sunday started allowing a maximum of 6,000 pilgrims a day to enter the sprawling Grand Mosque in Mecca. Only Saudi citizens and residents will be permitted to enter the mosque during this first phase of reopening, and each person has up to three hours to complete the pilgrimage.  \u2014- MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 The premier of Australia's Victoria state has called on citizens to 'stay the course' after large groups flooded beaches and parks at the weekend in defiance of strict lockdown regulations. Victoria, emerging from a major winter spike in coronavirus cases, relaxed lockdown regulations last weekend but still allowed only five people from up to two households to congregate outside. Many ignored those regulations on Saturday and crowded parks and beaches, causing Premier Daniel Andrews to remind Victorians not to be selfish and maintain social distancing. Victoria reported only 12 new coronavirus cases and one death Sunday, well down on the peaks of winter. Andrews said the situation in Victoria is 'delicately poised' as the state moves toward further easing of lockdown rules. 'People love to go to the beach when it's sunny but there's a global pandemic on,' he said. 'Surely, there's a greater urge to see this thing, to defeat it and to have a normal summer and have a COVID normal Christmas and 2021.' ___ SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 64 new cases of the coronavirus, the fourth straight day its increase came below 100, possibly reflecting the fewer number of tests conducted during one of the biggest holidays of the year. The figures released by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Sunday brought the national caseload to 24,091, including 421 deaths. Thirty-eight of the new cases were reported from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area. Health workers have struggled to track transmissions tied to churches, hospitals, schools and offices. Seventeen of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.7 Tech Stocks To Buy On Sale[1]This too shall pass. Those four words should be taped to the computer screen of every investor. If you own shares of the tech sector, you've seen your portfolio take quite a hit. Tech stocks were largely immune from the effects of the pandemic. However, as investors are looking to rebalance their portfolios, tech stocks were obvious targets for some profit-taking. And at the end of the day, that's what I believe the latest tech selloff amounts to. Stocks don't move in one direction all the time. Sure, there may be some saber-rattling about breaking up big tech. But with an election in less than two months, nobody will have the political will to do anything. That doesn't mean that it's all going to be smooth sailing. Sure, the Federal Reserve did its part by promising low-interest rates until the end of time (or at least through 2023 whatever comes first). But the rest of 2020 is likely to be volatile for stocks. First, there's still the novel coronavirus hanging around. It's not going to simply disappear after election day. That will take some combination of a vaccine and/or therapeutic. And all the likely candidates seem to be getting farther away the deeper into clinical trials they get. And we have an election. But we are not likely to know the winner of the election on election night. In fact, for those who remember the spectacle of 'hanging chads', this election could make that one look like amateur hour. The bottom line is there will be uncertainty. But there are always gains to be found, particularly now that their stock price has come down a little bit. Here are seven tech stocks that you can look to add or increase a position in now that they're trading at a discount. View the \"7 Tech Stocks To Buy On Sale\"[2].

(AP Photo/Esteban Felix)SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 43 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 from across the country as infections begin to spread beyond the greater capital area, which has been at the center of a virus resurgence since late May. The figures announced by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday brought national totals to 12,800 cases, including 282 deaths. Seventeen of the new cases came from the Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea's 51 million people live, while infections were also reported in other major cities such as Daejeon, Gwangju, Busan and Sejong. </p><p>Twenty of the new cases were linked to international arrivals as the coronavirus continues to strengthen its hold in Southern Asia, the United States and beyond. Authorities in recent weeks have been struggling to track transmissions that have been popping up from various places as people increasingly venture out in public amid an erosion in citizen vigilance. ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 Experts say the pandemic is wreaking havoc in poor and war-torn nations. \u2014 Virus cases worldwide hit 10 million and deaths have surpassed 500,000. \u2014 UK PM Boris Johnson says the pandemic 'has been a disaster' for Britain. \u2014 Hunger stalks Yemen's children as pandemic hits Arab world's poorest nation. \u2014 Nurses, doctors feel strain as virus races through Arizona. \u2014 The pandemic means millions of women in Africa and other developing regions could lose years of success in contributing to household incomes and asserting their independence. ___  Follow all of AP's pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url> ___ (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: SALEM, Ore. \u2014 Gov. Kate Brown announced Monday that people throughout Oregon will be required to wear face coverings in indoor public spaces starting Wednesday to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  The guidance applies to businesses and members of the public visiting indoor public spaces, she said in a news release.  Face covering requirements were mandated in eight counties last week. Over the past month, Brown said the disease has spread at an alarming rate in both urban and rural counties. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth play a critical role in reducing the spread of the disease because droplets from people's breath can carry the virus to others without people realizing it, she said.  She said she did not want to close businesses again as has happened in other states that are seeing a spike in cases. She said Oregon Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) will take the lead in enforcing face covering requirements for all covered Oregon businesses. ___ TOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly says she will issue an executive order mandating the use of masks in public starting Friday to stop the spread of COVID-19. 'The evidence could not be clearer \u2014 wearing a mask is not only safe, but it is necessary to avoid another shutdown,' the Democratic governor told reporters Monday. Kelly's executive order would require every Kansan to wear a mask if they are around other people. She said her administration will issue specific guidance later this week and will work with the attorney general's office to implement the policy. Local officials would enforce the policy. '#8217;This is all we have to fight this virus and it is up to each of us to do our part,' Kelly said. Kansas health officials reported on Monday at least 14,443 confirmed coronavirus cases, an increase of 905 since Friday. The state also had six more deaths from COVID-19, bring the total number of deaths in the state to 270. Kansas reported that 1,152 people had been hospitalized. ___ MIAMI \u2014 In South Beach, not wearing a mask could lead to a $50 fine starting Tuesday. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said the broader regulations, which include requiring masks when not able to socially distance, including outside, in condominium common areas and at hotels, will be punishable with a verbal warning or fine. A curfew is also being discussed. 'We don't have too many tools left in our kit, and we don't want to be forced to return to a shelter in place order that proved so economically devastating,' Gelber said, urging residents to comply. The city will also dispatch ambassadors to congested areas to pass out free masks. 'To those of you who seem to believe that wearing a mask is a political statement \u2014 it is not. This virus couldn't care who you support or what party you belong to,' said Gelber. 'I don't know the politics of the 13 seniors living here in South Beach and who recently perished.' ___ LONDON \u2014 The British government has reimposed lockdown restrictions in the English city of Leicester after a spike in coronavirus infections, including the closure of shops that don't sell essential goods and schools. In a statement in Parliament, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government won't be recommending that the city joins in the easing of the lockdown in England that is due to take place on Saturday, which includes the reopening of pubs and restaurants. He also said non-essential retailers, such as department stores and electronic retailers, will have to close again, two weeks after they reopened. In addition, he said that schools will have to close from Thursday, though they will stay open for vulnerable children. And he also travel to, from and within the city will have to be curtailed. Hancock said 'precise and targeted actions like these will give the virus nowhere to hide and help us defeat this invisible killer.' ___ AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 A group of Texas bar owners filed lawsuits Monday seeking to overturn Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's order that closed their businesses to help contain the spread of the coronavirus in the state. Abbott has pinpointed the re-opening of bars last month as one of the sources behind a dramatic spike in new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations that has made Texas a national hotspot in a virus resurgence. The lawsuits filed in Austin, Houston and Galveston allege Abbott doesn't have the authority under the state constitution to make such an order, and that it targets bars while allowing other establishments, such as hair and nail salons and tattoo studios to remain open. Abbott's order shuttered establishments that make at least 51 percent of their revenue from alcohol sales. It also trimmed restaurant dining capacity from 75 percent to 50 percent.' The bar owners say Abbott should bring the Legislature into a special session to address the issue. A spokesman for Abbott did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ___ JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2014 The city of Jacksonville, where President Trump is expected to accept the Republican nomination, enacted a mandatory mask requirement for public and indoor locations, and 'in other situations where individuals cannot socially distance.'  The requirement begins at 5 p.m. Monday. This is a reversal from city leaders. On June 23, Jacksonville mayor Lenny Curry said he didn't plan to issue a mask mandate. 'I do not think that's a prudent action to take,' Curry said at the time. 'We do not need to have law enforcement out in public enforcing this. It's not an efficient use of resources and we're not going to prosecute people, start prosecuting people, ticketing people and arresting people because they choose not to wear a mask.' He had urged people to wear masks and to socially distance themselves. The Republican event is scheduled to be held in Jacksonville in late August. ___ CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is done talking about why he pushed out a top health official during the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican governor deflected multiple questions Monday about the forced resignation of former public health commissioner Cathy Slemp as he continued to doubt the accuracy of the state's virus caseload numbers.  Justice has said he thinks the state's active caseload may have been overstated, floating the idea that the tally could be exaggerated by around 300 cases, while providing little detail. He has blamed Slemp, who has worked for decades in public health, and suggested she was responsible for the discrepancy before having her removed from her post last week.  'There's no point in continuing to debate my decision or my lack of confidence in Dr. Slemp,' he told reporters Monday, adding that a 'culmination of a lot of different things' prompted his decision. He did not elaborate.  Slemp's resignation has drawn a sharp rebuke from high-ranking officials at the respected Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who said they were 'stunned and troubled' by her removal.  'We need more than ever the work of dedicated public health officials speaking honestly about what is happening \u2014 and what all of us can do together to save lives,' they wrote in a statement.  Slemp, in a resignation letter provided by the state health department, urged officials to listen to science. 'I encourage all to stay true to the science, to further work to engage and empower communities to address such an unprecedented situation collectively, to meet people where they are and to move forward together,' she wrote. The governor has said the health department is trying to fill Slemp's former position as soon as possible. ___ DAKAR, Senegal \u2014 Senegal is reopening its air borders as of July 15, President Macky Sall announced Monday night even as he himself remained in isolation after being exposed to COVID-19. In his address to the nation, Sall also lifted a state of emergency and curfew that has been in effect in the West African nation. He urged people to wear masks in public saying not only was it required but it was a 'civic duty.' Senegal has had nearly 6,700 confirmed cases, including the president's brother. Health officials say 108 people have died. There will be unspecified rules in connection with the resumption of commercial flights, Sall said, possibly hinting that incoming passengers may be subject to certain restrictions.  It was not immediately clear if the measure would apply to all countries, including those with mounting cases such as the United States. Land borders are to remain closed, he added. ___ CHEYENNE, Wyo. \u2014 Gov. Mark Gordon says Wyoming will keep current public health orders to contain the coronavirus in place for two more weeks amid a surge in reported cases.  State officials had been gradually easing up on restrictions since early May.  Gordon says the increase in known cases makes clear the threat of COVID-19 isn't going away.  The Wyoming Department of Health reports 1,450 laboratory confirmed and suspected coronavirus cases in the state, including 1,070 people who have recovered from the illness.  Seven people are reported hospitalized. No more than 50 people may gather in confined spaces without restrictions under the ongoing state health orders. ___ BOISE, Idaho \u2014 Officials say Idaho residents may vote in person during elections in August and November despite the continuing spread of the coronavirus.  The Idaho Statesman reports Chief Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck said Idaho plans to operate standard elections rather than exclusively using absentee ballots.  Idaho's May 19 primary was the first statewide election held by mail only. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed a proclamation in April allowing the change that resulted in record voter turnout across the state.  Little says he may request a special session of the state Legislature to address the November election. ___ MADRID \u2014 More than 1,000 Spanish health workers are demonstrating in Madrid's Puerta del Sol square against what they say is a lack of job security. The protesters gathered Monday evening also demanded more resources to do their work. The demonstration, with protesters complying with social distancing rules, was organized by the grass-roots movement Sanitarios Necesarios (Needed Health Workers). By the end of last week, more than 52,000 Spanish health workers had been infected by the new coronavirus. ___ The head of the World Health Organization says the coronavirus pandemic is 'not even close to being over' and that the outbreak is accelerating globally. At a news briefing on Monday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that Tuesday marks six months since the U.N. health agency was first informed of a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in China -- the first indications of the coronavirus' emergence. 'Six months ago, none of us could have imagined how our world and our lives would be thrown into turmoil by this new virus,' he said, noting WHO has since recorded more than 10 million cases and 500,00 deaths globally.  Tedros said WHO will be convening a meeting this week to assess the progress made in coronavirus research so far and reevaluate priorities moving forward as the pandemic continues.  Dozens of vaccine candidates are currently in early stages of testing and some may move into late-stage testing this summer. Tedros warned that because 'most people remain susceptible' to the virus, the world is still only in the early stages of the outbreak. 'The worst is yet to come,' he said. 'With this kind of environment and condition, we fear the worst.' ___ TUPELO, Miss. \u2014 The mayor of the northeast Mississippi city where Elvis Presley was born announced that masks would be required in all public buildings and businesses starting Monday and decided to debunk a wide variety of rumors at once.  After asking residents to listen to health care professionals, Mayor Jason Shelton wrote on Facebook: 'Also, ANTIFA is not coming to Tupelo, Elvis statues are not being removed, you are not the target of some type of global conspiracy, it is impossible to erase history and no one has attempted to do so, COVID is not a hoax, you shouldn't believe and share posts that are obviously false or used as political propaganda, and there is nothing 'liberal' about any of the actions that have been taken by our administration regarding these matters,'  'Those were all specific allegations I have received either by phone, email or social media,' he said in a brief phone interview Monday.  Responses to his message on Friday and a follow-up Twitter message on Monday ranged from praise to 'Your days are numbered.'  Shelton, a Democrat, has pushed for years to remove the Confederate battle flag from Mississippi's state flag -- something the state Legislature voted on Sunday to do. The City Council overturned his 2018 executive order to stop flying the flag at city buildings, but was poised \u2014 coincidentally, just after the Legislature's vote \u2014 to revoke that ordinance on Monday, he said. ___ CARSON CITY, Nev. \u2014 Nevada health officials say more than half of the state's confirmed coronavirus cases have been people aged 20 to 49 and 42% have been Latino.  The state's COVID-19 response director said in a telephone call with reporters Monday that they intend to release a response plan geared toward containing the coronavirus among those demographic groups.  The state reported a total of nearly 17,900 confirmed coronavirus cases and 504 deaths as of Sunday.  In response to an uptick in confirmed cases, Gov. Steve Sisolak has implemented a face-covering mandate for public places throughout Nevada. ___ BERLIN \u2014 Swiss authorities say 20 people who were patrons of a bar outside Zurich have tested positive for the coronavirus, and it is suspected that the virus spread there from an outbreak at club in the city. Aargau canton (state) authorities said in a statement on their website Monday that patrons of the bar in Spreitenbach who were infected had been linked to the 'superspreader event' at the Flamingo Club in Zurich. They said that they were in contact with the infected people and other others and 'where necessary, quarantine has been ordered.' No further details were given, but the local media reported about 100 people had visited the bar during the evening in question. Zurich authorities on the weekend said some 300 people had been ordered into quarantine after the so-called 'superspreader' outbreak at the Flamingo Club. In that case, a man who had been at the club the weekend before tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, and that five people who were with him there were then tested and also were positive and reported to authorities on Friday. The others were tracked down and ordered into quarantine on Saturday. Swiss officials are working on new guidance for clubs and say they may be forced to closing such facilities again if the outbreaks continue.15 Energy Stocks Analysts Love the Most[1]There are more than 450 energy companies traded on public markets.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday it has reported 45 additional coronavirus cases over a 24-hour period. It says the additional figures brought the country\u2019s total to 13,816 with 296 deaths.    The agency says 20 of the newly recorded cases were locally infected patients while the rest 25 were associated with international arrivals.    South Korea on Monday confirmed 26 new virus cases, four of them domestic infections and the rest 22 coming from overseas. Health officials said it was the first time for the number of daily local infections to come below 10 since May 19.    South Korean officials consider imported cases as a lesser threat than local transmissions because the country is mandating COVID-19 tests and enforcing two-week quarantines on all people arriving from abroad.    ___    HERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:    \u2014 Desperate race to corral pandemic takes on even greater urgency as burgeoning economic crisis collides with political turmoil    \u2014 Top Congressional Republicans meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on the next COVID-19 aid package    \u2014 European Union leaders cautiously optimistic a deal is in sight on a massive budget and coronavirus recovery fund    \u2014 Head of the line: Big companies got coronavirus loans first, according to an AP analysis of the $659 billion Paycheck Protection Program    \u2014 School districts reopening classrooms in the fall wrestle with whether to require teachers and students to wear face masks    \u2014 Workers turn into amateur sleuths to track virus cases    Follow all of AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url>   (Ad)  America\u2019s $51 trillion recovery will be of unheard magnitude. Only it\u2019s not from a single thing the government is doing. Or even from big corporations.   Instead, it\u2019s due to one tiny pioneering American company. You won\u2019t believe what its made-in-America device does. It\u2019s poised to create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech \u2014 combined!    ___    HERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:    MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Australia\u2019s hotspot Victoria state has reported 374 new cases of COVID-19, the second-highest daily tally ever recorded.    Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews also announced on Tuesday three more deaths in the state, bringing the national toll 126.    Andrews said a lockdown in Australia\u2019s second-largest city Melbourne and neighoring semi-rural Mitchell Shire which began two weeks ago was having an impact.    \u201cYou\u2019d like to see numbers coming down. At the end of the day though, we\u2019re not seeing the doubling and doubling again\u201d of cases, Andrews said. \u201cSo what that says to me ... is that the sorts of measures we\u2019ve put in place are having a direct impact.\u201d    Since a record 428 cases were reported on Friday, Victoria has recorded 217, 363 and 275 cases on consecutive days.    Tighter regulations will come into force on the Victoria-New South Wales border on Wednesday that will only allow border communities to cross for essential work, health and education reasons.    ___    MEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico continues to register high levels of new coronavirus cases, as the Health Department reports 5,172 new confirmed infections, bring the country\u2019s total to almost 350,000.    Confirmed daily death reports fell on Monday to 301, for a total of almost 39,500.    The continued high rate of transmission has caused some Mexican tourist areas to walk back previous re-openings and crack down on mask rules. The southern area of the Caribbean coast state of Quintana Roo re-imposed limits on hotel occupancy, and the Baja California resort of La Paz closed beaches again.    Over the weekend, the local government of the colonial city of San Miguel de Allende announced Sunday that police had arrested two tourists for refusing to wear face masks.    The city has decreed face masks obligatory in public spaces, and violators could receive a warning, up to 36 hours in jail and/or a fine of up to $385.    The city government said the two Mexican tourists were approached by police in the picturesque city square on Saturday night and reminded of the face mask rule. The man and a woman refused to put on masks. They were detained, held for 12 hours and fined the equivalent of about $67.    ___    TOPEKA, Kansas \u2014 Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has issued an order requiring masks and daily temperature checks in the state\u2019s K-12 schools.    Kelly on Monday set some coronavirus-inspired rules that are stricter than guidelines adopted by the Republican-controlled State Board of Education.    Kelly also released the text of a proposed order to delay the reopening of public and private elementary, middle and high schools for three weeks from mid-August until Sept. 9. Kansas law requires the state school board\u2019s approval for a delay and it is scheduled to meet Wednesday morning.    The Democratic governor\u2019s plans for schools are inspiring criticism from Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature and conservatives outside state government already critical of her handling of the pandemic. The small-government, free-market Kansas Policy Institute, influential with GOP conservatives, called Kelly\u2019s actions \u201csimply unwarranted.\u201d    Kansas has seen the number of reported novel coronavirus cases more than double since June 10, when its rolling seven-day average of new cases per day bottomed out after peaking in early May. The state now has reported more than 23,000 cases and more than 300 COVID-19-related deaths.    ___    MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Travelers will be required to wear face coverings at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.    The Metropolitan Airports Commission approved the resolution Monday. The new requirement takes effect next Monday and applies to all public spaces at the airport, including outdoor locations where people cannot reliably maintain at least 6 feet of physical distance from others.    The regulation also applies in terminals, parking ramps, shuttle buses, trams, rental car operations and other similar facilities.    Commission CEO Brian Ryks says as COVID-19 cases continue to rise, \u201cit is clear that face coverings along with social distancing and frequent hand washing or sanitizing are key to keep ourselves and those around us safer.\u201d    Ryks notes that a growing number of airports already require face coverings.    There are exceptions for people who cannot wear a mask for reasons of health, safety or disability, and for eating and drinking.    Children 2 years and younger or unaccompanied minors 12 or younger are also excluded.    Free face coverings are available at information booths at the airport\u2019s terminals.    ___    FARMINGTON, N.M. -- Navajo Nation lawmakers are considering overturning a presidential veto of a bill that cancels the tribe\u2019s primary election in early August over concerns about the coronavirus.    Tribal lawmakers approved a bill in April to cancel the tribe\u2019s primary election and decide the winner by plurality vote in the November general election. Tribal President Jonathan Nez later vetoed the action and urged lawmakers and election officials to come up with alternatives to preserve tribal members\u2019 rights to vote.    Nearly 30% of Navajo voters turned out for the tribe\u2019s last primary election for local officials in 2016.    The veto override requires a two-thirds vote of the Navajo Nation Council, which is holding its summer session remotely this week.    The lawmakers heard reports Monday from tribal officials that overwhelmingly focused on the coronavirus.    ___    DENVER, Colorado -- Colorado health and education officials have released guidance as public school districts across the state prepare for the fall semester amid the coronavirus pandemic.    That includes staggered schedules, face coverings, the option of remote learning and limited contact among students. But a busy school environment poses unique challenges, including isolating students in groups, or \u201ccohorts,\u201d to limit the spread of the disease.    An epidemiologist for the state health department says keeping students in such groups \u201cis an essential component.\u201d    Much of the guidance issued Monday will be left to local health and education officials to implement.    ___    PHOENIX, Arizona -- Officials say Arizona is seeing a slight downward trend in the number of people on ventilators and in intensive care because of the coronavirus.    The state reported 1,559 new COVID-19 cases Monday and 23 deaths. The deaths typically are lower at the start of the week because not all hospitals submit data over the weekend.    Arizona had been experiencing some of the highest rates of coronavirus cases in the country since the governor lifted a stay-at-home order in mid-May.    Hospitalizations reported Monday were at the lowest level in more than two weeks. The number of people on ventilators and in intensive care also has gone down.    ___    ATLANTA, Georgia \u2014 New York\u2019s Democratic governor flew to Georgia, pledging to help the city of Savannah fight COVID-19, in a barely concealed rebuke to Georgia\u2019s Republican leadership as virus cases continued to rise in the southern state.    Gov. Andrew Cuomo declined to directly criticize Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, but warmly praised Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, a native New Yorker who has been a scorching critic of Kemp in recent days.    Cuomo said New York has to be interested in what\u2019s happening in other parts of the country because infected people from other states are likely to spread virus cases in New York.    Johnson was the pacesetter in a revolt by local Georgia officials against Kemp\u2019s refusal to allow local governments to order people to wear masks. Kemp eventually sued Atlanta\u2019s mayor and city council, asking a judge to order local officials to stop taking actions at variance with his own executive orders on coronavirus.    Cuomo delivered masks, test kits, gowns, face shields and hand sanitizer. He said he would help Savannah set up two new public testing sites aimed at lower income people, and said he would share contact tracing expertise.    Kemp spokesperson Candace Broce declined to comment on Cuomo\u2019s visit.    ___    JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2014 The upcoming plan to have the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville to renominate President Donald Trump continues to be on shaky ground.    Even after the GOP announced plans to scale back the convention and hold more events outside, the local sheriff said people\u2019s safety cannot be guaranteed.    \u201cWhere we are today is we can\u2019t support this plan,\u201d Sheriff Mike Williams told local news outlets Monday. \u201cWhere do we go from here is a good question. But where we are today, we can\u2019t support it.\u201d    Williams added: \u201cThere\u2019s got to be some major re-working of what\u2019s happening.\u201d    ___    The United States\u2019 top infectious disease expert says the best way to manage the surging coronavirus \u2014 and prevent future outbreaks \u2014 is by sticking to what he calls the \u201cfundamentals.\u201d    Dr. Anthony Fauci tells the nation\u2019s governors that those include the universal wearing of face masks, shutting bars, limiting indoor dining, avoiding crowds and frequent hand-washing.    Fauci addressed governors Monday via videoconference with members of the White House coronavirus task focus. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the audio.    Task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx urged governors to watch for even the tiniest increase in the percentage of positive cases, saying it means an uptick is coming.    ___    LINCOLN, Neb. \u2014 Nebraska lawmakers have returned to their session with lingering concerns about the coronavirus and safety precautions that will likely remain in place until they adjourn for the year.    The 60-day session resumed Monday with plexiglass separation barriers in the chamber, mandatory temperature checks to enter and tougher restrictions on who can access the room.    Lawmakers suspended their session March 25 after passing an emergency coronavirus funding bill. They took no other action for nearly four months but still have 17 scheduled work days remaining this year.    ___    MOSCOW \u2014 A Russian court has ordered a coronavirus-denying monk to pay a fine for \u201cinciting hatred\u201d through his sermons.    The court in the Ural Mountains region ruled that Father Sergiy should pay a fine of 18,000 rubles (about $250).    When the contagion engulfed Russia, Sergiy declared the coronavirus non-existent and denounced government efforts to stem the outbreak as \u201cSatan\u2019s electronic camp.\u201d    In fiery sermons laden with anti-Semitic statements and vitriol against a masonic \u201cworld-government,\u201d the monk has called vaccines being developed against COVID-19 part of a global plot to control the masses via chips.    Russia has reported over 777,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 12,000 deaths.    ___    WASHINGTON \u2014 The National Zoo will reopen to the public later this week with restrictions to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.    The Smithsonian, which runs the zoo, announced Monday that it will reopen with limited hours starting Friday, July 24.    The National Air and Space Museum\u2019s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, will also reopen, but the rest of the museums in the Smithsonian network will remain closed.    All visitors will be required to obtain free, timed-entry passes in advance, and those over age 6 will be required to wear a face mask at all times, including outdoors.    ___    WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is issuing guidance on preventing discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in the country\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.    The guidelines announced Monday instruct health departments to ensure that racial and ethnic minority populations \u201care not subjected to excessive wait times, rejected for hospital admissions, or denied access to intensive care units compared to similarly situated non-minority individuals.\u201d    They also seek to ensure that the locations chosen for virus-testing sites are accessible to minority communities.    From the start, the novel Coronavirus has ravaged minority populations in the United States, with Black communities recording infection and death numbers that far outstrip their percentage of the population.    Surgeon General Jerome Adams says the pandemic \u201chas magnified many of the racial and health disparities that quite frankly have been with us for generations.\u201d    ___    NEW YORK \u2014 The release of Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cTenet\u201d has been postponed yet again.    It had been hoped that the highly anticipated, $200 million thriller would herald Hollywood\u2019s return to big theatrical releases Aug. 12.    But the surge of the virus across much of the U.S. has upended the industry\u2019s aims for even a late-August return.    Unlike with previous postponements, Warner Bros. on Monday didn\u2019t announce a new target date for \u201cTenet,\u201d already shifted from July 17 to July 31 and then Aug. 12.    ___    BRASILIA, Brazil \u2014 Two more ministers in the Cabinet of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro say they have tested positive for the coronavirus, which has been raging through Latin America\u2019s largest nation.    They are Minister of Citizenship Onyx Lorenzoni, 65, and Minister of Education Milton Ribeiro, 62.    Four Cabinet ministers have now tested positive, plus Bolsonaro.    Brazil has recorded more than 2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 79,488 deaths.    ___    WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is reviving its public coronavirus task force briefings, and President Donald Trump will again take on a starring role.    Trump says he\u2019ll lead a briefing at 5 p.m. Tuesday, his first since April 27.    The coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, briefed the public daily in March and April with Trump participating and dominating many of the televised sessions.    But the briefings disappeared in late April after ratings began to slide and Trump mused about the possibility of using disinfectants inside the body to kill the virus.    Some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers had publicly advocated for the return of briefings led by the president, who has slid against Democratic rival Joe Biden in recent polls.    ___    LONDON \u2014 Scientists at Oxford University say their experimental coronavirus vaccine has been shown in an early trial to prompt a protective immune response in hundreds of people who got the shot.    British researchers first began testing the vaccine in April in about 1,000 people, half of whom got the experimental vaccine. Such early trials are designed to evaluate safety and see what kind of immune response was provoked, but can\u2019t tell if the vaccine truly protects.    In research published Monday in the journal Lancet, scientists said that they found their experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced a dual immune response in people aged 18 to 55 that lasted at least two months after they were immunized.    \u201cWe are seeing good immune response in almost everybody,\u201d said Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University. \u201cWhat this vaccine does particularly well is trigger both arms of the immune system,\u201d he said.    Hill said that neutralizing antibodies are produced \u2014 molecules which are key to blocking infection. In addition, the vaccine also causes a reaction in the body\u2019s T-cells which help to fight off the coronavirus.   7 Gun Stocks to Buy During the Coronavirus Pandemic   Socially conscious investors may want to stop reading. But the fact is that gun stocks were some of the best-performing stocks at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. And they continue their positive momentum.   Some of that may be historical. Firearms sales tend to increase during an election year. But of course, this has not started out as a normal election year.   In March, the nation was gripped by pictures of long lines outside gun stores in several U.S. states. The website Ammo.com reported that bullet sales increased by 222% in the period from February 23 through March 15 as opposed to the first three weeks in February.   And according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), there was a 73% year-over-year increase in background checks in February.   \u201cThe world has never seen anything like this and people want to make sure they're prepared for whatever lies ahead, whether that be food shortages, government shutdown, or worse,\" a spokesperson for Ammo.com said in an emailed statement. \"When everything around you is uncertain, having a supply of ammunition can make our customers feel safer.\"   Given the likelihood of increased firearms sales, we\u2019ve created this presentation that highlights seven gun stocks that you should consider for your portfolio.

This puzzlement has not been reduced by his latest offering. </p><p>Those big American tech companies own all our data thus, well, thus something must be done[1]!\u00a0 All of the nation's data, for example, could accrue to a national data fund, co-owned by all citizens (or, in the case of a pan-European fund, by Europeans). Whoever wants to build new services on top of that data would need to do so in a competitive, heavily regulated environment while paying a corresponding share of their profits for using it. Such a prospect would scare big technology firms much more than the prospect of a fine. The current approach - let's have big tech firms swallow as much data as they can and apply competition law to how they design their websites - is toothless. Fixing online shopping is important but not if it accelerates the transition to a perverse form of data feudalism, where the key resource is owned by just one or two corporations. We're a lot less worried about a company turning a buck by putting together our rampant doughnut habit, our GSP location and the ad from the local baker than we are by the idea that the government owns all this stuff. The temptation to use it to eliminate Bad Thought would seem to be rather greater among those not motivated by lucre and pelf. Governments and such information don't have a good historical record. And as to feudalism, the definition was that the government owned everything, we all just gaining it upon licence, wasn't it?\u00a0 The greater problem though here is economic. The data itself isn't worth anything at all. That's why we all, individually, give it away. It is the very process of collecting and processing it which adds value. There is no value add here other than the systems which do that, those tech giants being the systems that do. Think of Ricardo and what that means for resource rents. The simple existence of some resource, oil, gold, diamonds say, belongs to no one as no one has actually created that resource. The implication being that the government of the area should tax the simple existence value of the resource until the pips squeak. Revenue's got to come from somewhere, it should come from non-distortionary sources, taxing what no one has created cannot change the effort into creation, can it?\u00a0 But we all also agree that the people who invest capital, effort, time, into developing those resources should indeed profit from having done so. Incentives do matter after all. At which point, if there is no resource here, only the effort, then what taxation of the resource rent should there be?\u00a0 If it is true, as we maintain it is, that it is the collection and processing of the data itself which adds the value then what is there for the government to own?

The barrage of unflattering comparisons and allegations of misconduct unfolded Wednesday during an extraordinary hearing that summoned Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before a congressional committee. The committee is looking into allegations that the companies have been abusing the popularity of their products and services to stifle competition and innovation. All four CEOs appeared via video because of the pandemic. </p><p>Lawmakers were particularly harsh on Google, whose dominant search engine serves as the main gateway to the internet, and Facebook, whose social network with more than 2 billion people has has had trouble blocking efforts to spread bogus information in attempt to sway elections and sow social unrest. Both Pichai and Zuckerberg insisted their companies have worked hard to fix any problems on their services and strive to improve their mostly free services to keep their users happy to they can continue to sell the ads that bring in most of their revenue. ___ 4:45 p.m. A key House lawmaker investigating Big Tech's power is squarely targeting Amazon.  Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a hearing Wednesday that evidence shows that the e-commerce giant is only interested in dominating the market and is 'fundamentally anti-competitive.'  Cicilline said 'Congress must take action.' (Ad) As our country has gotten richer than ever... the income disparity widens every year. And coronavirus just made everything far worse. The problem is, most Americans don't understand why this is happening. Instead they're focused on face masks and stimulus checks. Do you understand the secret the 1% hope you never find out? As chair of a House Judiciary panel, Cicilline is looking toward possible new legislation to update century-old antitrust laws. But Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner rejects the idea that legislation is needed \u2014 showing it could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress. The Bezos, along with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook and Google were answering lawmakers' questions about their companies' practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the technology industry. ___ 3:50 p.m. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he can't guarantee that the company isn't accessing seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives had previously denied.  His comments came Wednesday during a congressional hearing into the market dominance of four tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been scrutinizing Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.  'We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,' said Bezos, in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Amazon's home state of Washington. 'But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.' A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted Amazon employees who said they did have access to seller data to make competing products, including a car trunk organizer that Amazon copied.  Bezos said he was aware of the article and is still looking into the allegations. 'I'm still not satisfied that we've gotten to the bottom of it,' he said. ___ 3:30 p.m. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again being put on the defensive in a congressional hearing over the social network's role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  And Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, has brought the issue current with concerns that right-wing groups are using Facebook to infiltrate the Black Lives Matter movement and to spread anti-Semitic propaganda. Zuckerberg says Facebook uses sophisticated technology to intercept hate speech, often before it's seen on the platform. 'It hurts our business,' he said. Zuckerberg's comments came at hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs are answering for their companies' practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry. ___ 2:45 p.m. Facebook internal company documents are being deployed against CEO Mark Zuckerberg by lawmakers asserting that the company has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday that documents obtained from the company 'tell a very disturbing story' of Facebook's acquisition of the Instagram messaging service. He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could 'meaningfully hurt' Facebook. Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a 'complement' to Facebook's services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsAPP messaging service. The questioning came at a congressional hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. ___ 2:30 p.m. The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the power of major technology companies accused Google of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits. Rep. David Cicilline peppered Google CEO Sundar Pichai with the allegations of abusive behavior while grilling him Wednesday during a hearing that is also putting Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on virtual hot seats while answering questions posed through a video stream. Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing. Pichai struggled to answer one question about whether Google threatened to dump Yelp from its search engine database after the restaurant review site told Google to stop scraping its site for content. Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015. Companies Mentioned in This Article 10 Great Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Under $10[1]As the P/E ratios of most S&amp;#38;P 500 companies look very expensive and the stock market continues to regularly hit new all-time highs, it's very difficult for investors to find cheap stocks to buy now. This goes for both share price, since most stocks are trading higher on a per-share basis, and valuation relative to earnings. Right now, the typical S&amp;#38;P 500 company is trading at about 25 times forward-looking earnings. Historically, S&amp;#38;P 500 companies have traded at about 15 times earnings in more normal markets. While the S&amp;#38;P 500 as a whole is expensive, there are still a handful undervalued stocks that are trading at less than $10.00 per share. Value investing opportunities for value exist if you know where to look. Putting together a list of cheap stocks to buy now requires looking into some smaller, riskier, unloved or undiscovered parts of the market. These low-priced stocks might not look especially attractive today, but long-term investors stand to profit if they are willing to be patient and hold onto shares of these companies through multiple market cycles. Some of these companies are great investing ideas because they're too small and too risky to attract the interest of most mutual funds and Wall Street money managers. Others have been beaten up by the market after a period of slowing earnings and profits, but are now trying to turn around and bounce back. In this list, you might find marijuana stocks, dividend-paying stocks, large-cap stocks, growth stocks, small-cap stocks, and even some bitcoin stocks. While these low-priced stocks have a lot of differences, these 10 stock picks all share a common characteristic, a super-low share price of $10.00 or less.View the \"10 Great Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Under $10\"[2].

The barrage of unflattering comparisons and allegations of misconduct unfolded Wednesday during an extraordinary hearing that summoned Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before a congressional committee. The committee is looking into allegations that the companies have been abusing the popularity of their products and services to stifle competition and innovation.      All four CEOs appeared via video because of the pandemic.      Lawmakers were particularly harsh on Google, whose dominant search engine serves as the main gateway to the internet, and Facebook, whose social network with more than 2 billion people has has had trouble blocking efforts to spread bogus information in attempt to sway elections and sow social unrest. Both Pichai and Zuckerberg insisted their companies have worked hard to fix any problems on their services and strive to improve their mostly free services to keep their users happy to they can continue to sell the ads that bring in most of their revenue.     ___      4:45 p.m.      A key House lawmaker investigating Big Tech\u2019s power is squarely targeting Amazon.      Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a hearing Wednesday that evidence shows that the e-commerce giant is only interested in dominating the market and is \u201cfundamentally anti-competitive.\u201d      Cicilline said \u201cCongress must take action.\u201d     As chair of a House Judiciary panel, Cicilline is looking toward possible new legislation to update century-old antitrust laws. But Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner rejects the idea that legislation is needed \u2014 showing it could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress.      The Bezos, along with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook and Google were answering lawmakers' questions about their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the technology industry.      ___      3:50 p.m.      Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he can't guarantee that the company isn't accessing seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives had previously denied.      His comments came Wednesday during a congressional hearing into the market dominance of four tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.      Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been scrutinizing Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.      \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d said Bezos, in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Amazon's home state of Washington. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d      A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted Amazon employees who said they did have access to seller data to make competing products, including a car trunk organizer that Amazon copied.      Bezos said he was aware of the article and is still looking into the allegations.      \u201cI\u2019m still not satisfied that we\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of it,\u201d he said.      ___      3:30 p.m.      Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again being put on the defensive in a congressional hearing over the social network\u2019s role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.      And Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, has brought the issue current with concerns that right-wing groups are using Facebook to infiltrate the Black Lives Matter movement and to spread anti-Semitic propaganda.      Zuckerberg says Facebook uses sophisticated technology to intercept hate speech, often before it\u2019s seen on the platform. \u201cIt hurts our business,\u201d he said.      Zuckerberg's comments came at hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs are answering for their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.      ___      2:45 p.m.      Facebook internal company documents are being deployed against CEO Mark Zuckerberg by lawmakers asserting that the company has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition.      Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday that documents obtained from the company \u201ctell a very disturbing story\u201d of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.      He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \u201cmeaningfully hurt\u201d Facebook.      Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \u201ccomplement\u201d to Facebook\u2019s services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsAPP messaging service.      The questioning came at a congressional hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.      ___      2:30 p.m.      The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the power of major technology companies accused Google of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.      Rep. David Cicilline peppered Google CEO Sundar Pichai with the allegations of abusive behavior while grilling him Wednesday during a hearing that is also putting Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on virtual hot seats while answering questions posed through a video stream.      Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.      Pichai struggled to answer one question about whether Google threatened to dump Yelp from its search engine database after the restaurant review site told Google to stop scraping its site for content. Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42715890732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-13V1-F07F-808N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1172\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Miami Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The number of cases in Tokyo rose to 60 on Sunday, highest since early May and nearly doubling from 31 five days ago. About half of recent daily confirmed cases have been detected among staff or customers of Tokyo\u2019s nightlife districts.    Tokyo\u2019s numbers were at their highs since the late May lifting of a pandemic state of emergency.    \u201cWe are closely watching the latest development,\u201d Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters. \u201cFrankly, this gives me a rather bad feeling.\u201d    He said he planned to meet with Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike to discuss the situation and a new set of caution scale that would balance disease prevention with maintaining economic activity. Koike planned to announce a new set of infection monitoring measures on Tuesday.    The latest cases brings Tokyo\u2019s total infections to 6,172, with 325 deaths \u2014 about one-third of national total.    ___    HERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:    \u2014 Experts say the pandemic is wreaking havoc in poor and war-torn nations.    \u2014 Virus cases worldwide hit 10 million and deaths have surpassed 500,000.    \u2014 UK PM Boris Johnson says the pandemic \u201chas been a disaster\u201d for Britain.    \u2014 Hunger stalks Yemen's children as pandemic hits Arab world's poorest nation.    \u2014 Nurses, doctors feel strain as virus races through Arizona.    \u2014 The pandemic means millions of women in Africa and other developing regions could lose years of success in contributing to household incomes and asserting their independence.    ___    Follow all of AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url>   (Ad)  The next big tech trend that could explode in today\u2019s new economy is coming to your hometown \u2013 which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.    ___    HERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:    LJUBLJANA, Slovenia \u2014 Slovenia is slashing the number of people in public gatherings from 500 to 50 after several cases of coronavirus emerged apparently as a result of social encounters.    Government spokesman Jelko Kacin said Monday the decision will be formally made later in the day. He said bigger events will need special permits and must guarantee they will meet social distancing rulles with the seating arrangements and other facilities.    Slovenia has confirmed 64 new cases in the past seven days after having none or one or two cases days for weeks. The European Union nation of 2 million people has had 111 deaths linked to COVID-19.    ___    LONDON -- The central England city of Leicester is waiting to find out if lockdown restrictions will be extended as a result of a spike in coronavirus infections.    The city\u2019s mayor, Peter Soulsby, told BBC radio that the British government had recommended in a document sent to him early Monday that \u201cwe continue the present level of restriction for a further two weeks beyond July 4.\u201d    On Saturday, England will see a number of lockdown restrictions eased. Pubs and restaurants, for example, will be allowed to reopen provided they abide by social distancing rules.    There has been some confusion after Home Secretary Priti Patel said Sunday that Leicester, a city of 330,000, faced a possible local lockdown in the wake of figures showing 866 new cases of coronavirus in the last two weeks.    Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he is \u201cconcerned about Leicester, we are concerned about any local outbreak.\u201d He said he wanted to stress that \u201cwe are not out of the woods yet.\u201d    ___    BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence chief says authoritarian countries are trying to \u201cexpand their spheres of influence\u201d amid the coronavirus crisis.    Bruno Kahl, the head of the BND intelligence service, didn\u2019t identify any countries by name in comments released by his office as he gave regular testimony to a parliamentary committee.    He said Monday the COVID-19 pandemic \u201cdamages the world economy, exacerbates existing conflicts and threatens the geopolitical balance of power.\u201d    Kahl said that, in trying to expand their influence, authoritarian states \u201cwill exploit the weaknesses of other international actors, fill in gaps and intensify hybrid measures.\u201d    ___    ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Movie theaters, casinos and children\u2019s summer camps reopened in Greece on Monday, while concerts, conferences, commercial fairs and artistic events can once again be held, in the latest phase of the country\u2019s easing of lockdown measures.    Outdoor summer movie theaters have already been open for several weeks, but this is the first time indoor theaters will be able to operate since the lockdown was imposed in March.    Greece\u2019s government imposed a lockdown early on in the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, a move that has been credited with keeping the number of deaths and critically ill patients low. On Sunday, Greece reported no new deaths and 10 new cases, for a total of 191 deaths and 3,376 confirmed cases. The country has gradually been easing restrictions.    On Wednesday, international flights will be allowed at regional airports across the country once more. Currently tourists can fly into only Athens or the northern city of Thessaloniki. Greece has been eager to attract foreign visitors, as tourism makes up a significant part of the country\u2019s economy.    \u2014-    BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s parliament has signed off on a government plan to lower sales tax and provide more money for families that it is hoped will stimulate spending and help the economy as coronavirus restrictions are eased.    The lower house of parliament on Monday approved the plan to lower the country\u2019s value added tax from 19% to 16% for half a year, starting July 1. A reduced tax for food and other necessities will be lowered from 7% to 5% under the plan.    In addition, lawmakers approved one-time bonus payments of 300 euros ($335) per child to families. The first 200 euros will be paid in September, followed by an additional 100 euros in October.    The measures are part of a 130 billion euro stimulus package proposed by Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government, which also includes financial incentives for electric and hybrid vehicles. They are expected to receive final approval from the upper house of parliament later Monday.    The Finance Ministry says the reduction in sales tax will result in some 13 billion euros less in revenue, while the child bonus program is expected to cost some 5.4 billion euros.    ___    BERLIN \u2014 Germany medical research company BioNTech SE says it has received an investment of $250 million from Singapore\u2019s Temasek and others as it races to develop the first vaccine against the coronavirus.    The Mainz-based biotechnology company said Monday that the investment will take the form of about $139 million in ordinary shares and $112 million in four-year mandatory convertible notes.    BioNTech in April became the first company in Germany to receive regulatory approval to conduct trials of its experimental mRNA-based vaccine on volunteers. Initial results from those early-stage trials are expected by early July.    Temasek is a sovereign wealth fund owned by the government of Singapore.    ___    PRAGUE \u2014 The number of new coronavirus cases in the Czech Republic continues to surge.    The day-to-day increase reached 305 on Sunday, the highest number since April 3.    The Czech Republic had a total of 11,604 confirmed cases of the virus through Sunday, including 348 deaths, according to Health Ministry figures.    Because of the increase in cases, Prague, the capital, and a region in the country\u2019s northeast will remain under orders to wear face masks beyond July 1, when the order will be lifted for the rest of the country, Health Minister Adam Vojtech said Monday.    In Prague, it will still be compulsory to wear face coverings on the subway and at indoor public gatherings of more than 100 people.    In the northeastern region, face masks will remain mandatory in indoor public spaces, on public transport and at gatherings of more than 100 people. The outbreak in that region is linked to miners from a coal mine, their relatives and their other contacts.    ___    MADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s foreign minister says that the European Union is putting together a list of 15 countries that are not bloc members and whose nationals will be allowed to visit from Wednesday.    The final list will be announced later on Monday or Tuesday morning, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya told Spain\u2019s Cadena SER radio.    She said she wasn\u2019t aware of pressure from the United States for the EU to reopen travel to their nationals, adding that countries have been chosen according to their coronavirus statistics \u2014 whether similar or not to that in the EU \u2014 trends of contagion and how realiable data is.    \u201cThis is not an exercise to be nice or unfriendly to other countries, this is an exercise of self-responsibility,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said.    Among the countries being discussed is Morocco, whose government doesn\u2019t plan to open borders until July 10. Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said that the EU is considering to accept travelers from China if Beijing reciprocates accepting travelers from the EU starting on July 1.    The minister also confirmed that Spain will fully reopen borders with Portugal, despite a spike in infections in the neighboring country.    ___    NEW DELHI \u2014 India on Monday reported nearly 20,000 new coronavirus infections, a new record for the country, as several states reimpose partial or full lockdowns to stem the spread of the virus.    India has seen a jump of nearly 100,000 cases over the past week, the health ministry said. In all, the country has confirmed 548,318 cases, making it the world\u2019s fourth-worst affected country after the United States, Brazil and Russia. India\u2019s death toll has reached 16,475.    The capital district of the northeastern state of Assam on the Bangladesh border has reimposed a full lockdown until July 12 following a spike in cases. Another border state, West Bengal, has extended its lockdown until July 31.    However, in India\u2019s worst-affected states \u2014 Maharashtra, which includes India\u2019s financial capital, Mumbai, and Delhi, home to the capital, New Delhi \u2014 most lockdown restrictions have been eased, with restaurants, shopping malls and parks reopened, and public buses and shared-ride services back on the roads.    ___    DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Civil aviation authorities in the United Arab Emirates have suspended all flights to Pakistan over fears about the spread of the coronavirus.    The UAE\u2019s state-run WAM news agency issued a statement late Sunday from the country\u2019s General Civil Aviation Authority announcing the decision.    Officials said flights would resume after the creation \u201cof a special laboratory\u201d to conduct coronavirus tests for those coming into the Emirates from Pakistan.    The decision comes after Pakistani media last week reported 27 passengers originating from Pakistan arrived in Hong Kong and tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. The passengers had transited through the UAE.    Pakistan restarted international travel earlier this month even as its critics said the airport precautions were limited and ineffective.    ___    MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Philippine officials say authorities in a central village may face criminal or administrative complaints for allowing a street parade and dance amid a strict coronavirus lockdown.    Mayor Edgar Labella of Cebu city said officials of Basak village have been ordered to explain why the religious fiesta gathering in honor of St. John the Baptist was held Saturday despite a quarantine prohibition against public gatherings. Performers in native wear and face masks danced during the night procession, which drew a large crowd.    While the Philippines has eased quarantine restrictions in most regions to revive its contracting economy, officials placed Cebu city back under a strict lockdown this month and deployed more policemen to enforce restrictions following a spike in infections.    The Philippines remains a Southeast Asian coronavirus hotspot with more than 35,000 confirmed infections, including 1,244 deaths.    ___    SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 42 new infections of COVID-19 as infections steadily climb in the greater capital area, forcing authorities to consider stronger social restrictions.    The figures announced by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday brought the national caseload to 12,757, including 282 deaths. Twenty-four of the new cases were reported from capital Seoul and nearby metropolitan areas, which have been at the center of a virus resurgence since late May. At least 12 of the new cases were linked to international arrivals as the virus continues to strengthen its hold in southern Asia, the United States and beyond.    South Korea was reporting hundreds of new cases a day in late February and early March following a major surge surrounding the southeast city of Daegu, where the majority of infections were linked to a single church congregation with thousands of members.    But while health authorities had used aggressive testing and contact tracing to contain the outbreak in that region, they are having a much harder time tracking recent transmissions in the Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of the country\u2019s 51 million people live. With people increasingly venturing out in the public, new clusters are popping out from just about everywhere, including nightspots, churches, restaurants, warehouses and among door-to-door salespeople.    Health Minister Park Neung-hoo during a briefing Sunday afternoon announced that the government is prepared to implement stronger social distancing measures if the epidemic continues to grow.    ___    BEIJING \u2014 China on Monday reported a further decline in new confirmed cases of COVID-19, with a total of just 12, including seven cases of domestic transmission in Beijing, where nearly 8.3 million people have now undergone testing in recent weeks. The number of new cases in the city was down by half from the day before, the National Health Commission reported.    No new deaths were reported Monday, leaving the total at 4,634 among 83,512 confirmed cases of COVID-19, . Currently 418 patients are in treatment, and another 112 are under observation for being suspected cases or for testing positive without showing any symptoms.    Beijing temporarily shut a huge wholesale food market where the virus spread widely earlier this month, re-closed schools and locked down some neighborhoods. Anyone leaving Beijing is required to have a negative virus test result procured within the previous seven days.    About 7.69 million results on people tested in Beijing have been returned, city official Zhang Qiang said Sunday. Beijing has more than 20 million people but authorities have focused so far on high risk groups.  Companies Mentioned in This Article  5 Stocks That Will Benefit From the Coronavirus   Investors are digesting the damage done to their portfolios in last week\u2019s coronavirus-induced correction. There was no place to hide from the bears who bore their claws and shredded the market from its record highs. And the reality is there is probably more volatility to come.   Many companies had reported earnings before the depth and breadth of this outbreak became apparent. And that means that it will be months before investors get a chance to see how the true impact that Covid-19 virus will have on 2020 revenue and earnings.   For risk-averse investors, it may be tempting to take a breather from the volatility. But, as the market showed yesterday, the reward is there for those willing to take the risk. Still, for the next few months \u2013 and maybe longer \u2013 this will not be like fishing in a barrel. Investors will have to take a targeted look at which companies are well-positioned in this environment.   In this special presentation, we\u2019ll show you five companies that address one of three areas that may benefit from the coronavirus. First, there are companies whose supply chains do not involve China. In theory this means their manufacturing should be less impacted from the virus.

Philippine officials placed the central city of Cebu back under a strict lockdown and retained quarantine restrictions in the capital for another two weeks as coronavirus infections continue to spike alarmingly. Duterte approved the moves Monday night, saying the virus campaign was not over. (Simeon Celi Jr./Malacanang Presidential Photographers Division via AP)KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The wife of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been hospitalized with double-sided pneumonia after getting infected with the new coronavirus. Zelenskiy's office said in a statement Tuesday that Olena Zelenska's condition was stable and the president himself and the couple's children tested negative for the virus on Monday. </p><p>Zelenska said she tested positive for the virus on Friday. Ukraine's authorities started to gradually ease lockdown restrictions in late May, resuming the operation of public transport, reopening malls and gyms. On Monday, the country's authorities resumed international flights to several countries. ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 China reimposes some travel restrictions in the capital to contain a new outbreak, highlighting calls for vigilance as the U.S., Europe and Latin America continue to reopen. \u2014 Health care workers are reckoning with the psychological toll of their work treating virus patients and fears of a resurgence. \u2014 U.S. data says death rates are 12 times higher for virus patients with chronic illnesses, hospitalization 6 times more likely than for otherwise healthy patients.  \u2014 A judge ruled the U.S. Treasury Department must release $679 million in coronavirus relief funding for tribes that it intended to withhold while a challenge over payments to tribal governments played out in court. \u2014 Many businesses are requiring customers and workers to sign forms saying they won't sue if they catch the coronavirus. \u2014 Baseball commissioner says whole season in jeopardy after a breakdown in talks over money issues. ___ Follow AP pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url> (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.___ HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: LYON, France \u2014 France's president and the CEO of drug maker Sanofi are visiting a vaccine lab amid a worldwide race to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus. Tuesday's visit comes after rival pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca this weekend announced a deal to supply 400 million vaccine doses to EU countries, including France. The company is hoping to have it ready by the end of the year. Efforts by AstraZeneca and Sanofi are among dozens of vaccine candidates being pursued around the world. The race has prompted concerns that an eventual vaccine will go to the richest countries first. Last month, Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson prompted outrage in France by promising to give the United States first access to the company's eventual vaccine, because the U.S. had invested more in its research. After pressure from the French government, Sanofi backtracked and said it would be available in all countries.  ___ HELSINKI \u2014 Finland says it has lifted the emergency powers act adopted by the lawmakers in mid-March to tackle the coronavirus crisis. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said the measure to end the state of emergency, effective Tuesday, was taken as the COVID-19 infection rate has slowed down in the Nordic nation. Marin said there was no need anymore for the exceptional measure act allowing bigger powers for the government and Finland would now gradually return to normal conditions. She however stressed that 'the end of the emergency act does not mean the threat of the epidemic is over' and urged Finns to continue practising social distancing and pay attention to hygiene. ___ ISLAMABAD \u2014 Authorities in Pakistan are taking action to seal off high-risk areas in the country's 20 biggest cities after an increase in coronavirus infections. Pakistan's National Command and Control Center says raids are being carried out to impose fines and shut markets, industries and shops where social distancing regulations were being violated. The sealing of high-risk areas began after Pakistan reported a big jump in COVID-19 deaths and a steady increase in infections. Pakistan put its entire population of 220 million under lockdown from March until last month, when Prime Minister Imran Khan's government loosened restrictions, saying it was necessary to save the country's economy. Critics say the government's gamble resulted into a sharp increase in infections and deaths. On Tuesday, Pakistan reported 111 new COVID-19 fatalities. It raised the overall death toll from the virus to 2,839 among 148,921 confirmed cases. ___ ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkey has made the wearing of face masks mandatory in five more provinces, following an uptick in COVID-19 cases. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted early Tuesday that the wearing of masks was now compulsory in 42 of Turkey's 81 provinces. In the remaining provinces, residents are required to wear masks on public transportation and in shops and malls, and are being advised to wear masks and keep to social distancing practices elsewhere. Koca tweeted: 'We cannot struggle against the virus without masks.' Turkey is seeing an upward trend in the daily number of infections after the government authorized cafes, restaurants, gyms, parks, beaches and museums to reopen, lifted inter-city travel restrictions and eased stay-at-home orders for the elderly and young at the start of June. The daily number of infections climbed to above 1,500 in the past five days after hovering around 800-900 previously. \u2014- JOHANNESBURG \u2014 Africa's coronavirus cases are now above a quarter-million after South Africa registered a series of daily record-high new cases over the weekend.  South Africa further loosened its lockdown measures on June 1, allowing alcohol sales, more business openings and religious gatherings limited to 50 people.  The country has more than a quarter of the cases on the 54-nation African continent with more than 73,000. It saw its highest jump in cases on Sunday with more than 4,300.  South Africa's struggle to balance measures to slow the spread of the virus and relieve economic pain are common throughout Africa, where the World Health Organization last week said the pandemic is now 'accelerating.' ___ ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Hundreds of health care workers have marched through central Athens demanding the hiring of permanent workers for the health sector, while Greece's hospital doctors' union declared a 24-hour strike Tuesday. The union for state hospital workers also declared a seven-hour work stoppage for the Greek capital and a 24-hour strike for the rest of the country with the same demands. Greece's center right government hired hundreds of workers for state hospitals on fixed-term contracts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Unions are demanding permanent hires, and for funding for the country's health care system. \u2014- NEW DELHI \u2014 India recorded another 10,000-plus coronavirus infections as patients swamp health services in its largest cities. The Health Ministry on Tuesday also reported a 24-hour increase of 380 deaths due to COVID-19, driving the death toll to 9,900. The 10,667 new cases raise the nation's total to 343,091, fourth-highest in the world behind the U.S., Brazil and Russia. The actual numbers, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be far higher due to a number of reasons such as limited testing. Maharashtra, the western state that is home to Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital, continues to have the highest state toll. Mumbai, Chennai and the capital New Delhi are seeing rising infections swamp their health services. New Delhi is a growing concern with the federal government criticizing its contact tracing and hospital capacity. The capital has about 10,000 beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients, half of which are already occupied. Hotels and sports stadiums are being considered for use as field hospitals. ___ WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 New Zealand is no longer free from the new coronavirus after two women who flew from London to see a dying parent tested positive. The new cases sparked a round of testing for anybody who might have been close to them, including their flight's fellow passengers and crew, staff members at a hotel and a family member.  The women are isolated and have delayed the funeral of their parent until they have recovered.  New Zealand has counted 22 deaths from COVID-19, and until Tuesday, everyone else among the 1,500 people known to have been infected had recovered.  ___ MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Philippine officials have placed a central city back under strict lockdown and retained quarantine restrictions in the capital for another two weeks as coronavirus infections continue to spike alarmingly. President Rodrigo Duterte approved in a televised meeting Monday night with key Cabinet officials a recommendation to lock down Cebu city anew and retain quarantine restrictions in metropolitan Manila, where many of the nearly 26,500 infections and more than 1,000 deaths have been recorded. First imposed in mid-March, the COVID-19 restrictions in metropolitan Manila have been among the longest in the world. 'The battle with COVID isn't over,' Duterte said. 'I can't stop you from going out and I can't catch all of you ... don't blame us. Do not forget that we warned you about the grave consequences.'7 Boring Stocks That Are Winners[1]Some stocks just don't get much attention during bull markets. They can be too boring for a growth portfolio. But when the market is going through a period of volatility and uncertainty, these tried-and-true performers have a way of making their way back to popularity. And there are good reasons for this. First, many of these boring stocks pay dividends. This simply means that the company will reward shareholders simply for holding on to its stock. Dividend stocks aren't designed to make you rich quickly. However they are designed to offer investors an amount of predictability. And we could all use a little bit of that right now. And predictable stocks can also help investors manage risk. It can be fun to invest in speculative stocks. But they include a risk premium. When these stocks go up (as they sometimes do) they usually have a return that exceeds the broader market. But when they go down (and they usually do) they usually go down more than the broader market. But 'boring' stocks tend to move closer to the broader market. If you want an analogy from current events, these stocks flatten the curve. They won't soar as high as riskier stocks, but they won't sink as low either. And right now, preserving capital should be the number one item on every investor's checklist. With that in mind, we've created this special presentation to highlight 7 conservative stocks that can help investors win this moment in time. Many of them pay dividends; some do not. But they all have solid fundamental reasons to own them now. View the \"7 Boring Stocks That Are Winners\"[2].

(AP Photo/Juan Karita)LONDON \u2014 Britain's top treasury official is preparing to announce new plans to help workers hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to unveil an income support program Thursday under which the government would subsidize the wages of workers whose hours have been cut due to the pandemic. He is scheduled to announce his plans in a speech to the House of Commons at around 11:45 a.m. BST (10:45 GMT).  The plan would replace a furlough program which is due to expire next month. </p><p>Under that program, the government pays 80% of the wages of workers who were placed on leave. The Times of London reports that the new wage subsidy program will be part of larger package of measures to support the U.K. economy, including a cut in the value-added tax and increased loans for businesses hurt by the pandemic. ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK \u2014 Is it the flu? With cold weather coming to the Northern Hemisphere, people want to know how to distinguish symptoms \u2014 Many at U.N. summit plead for a COVID-19 vaccine to be available and affordable to all, but their appeals are likely in vain \u2014 Huge study of a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine underway as U.S. health officials try to assure trust in any shot that is approved \u2014 Beijing auto show, the year's biggest sales event for a struggling global industry, is forging ahead with virus controls in place ___ Follow AP's pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url> ___ COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 Denmark's education minister is urging parents and schools to cancel 'all social events,' including camps but also private gatherings like birthday parties to which classmates are invited. (Ad) Many believe there's a revolution coming Others believe 5G will transform just about every industry in America. Receive a free report 'The Top 3 5G Stocks Causing this Revolution in 2020'... Education Minister Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil said in a letter on Wednesday the children's social activities should be suspended because 'an active effort is needed to ensure that we can keep up schools open.' Rosenkrantz-Theil said that of the increasing number of coronavirus cases Denmark is seeing, a large proportion of them are in children and young people aged 10-29.  \"Only by helping each other, we can slow down the infection again,' the minister said. 'We did it in the spring. Now is the time for us to roll up our sleeves again.'  Denmark has reported a total of 24,357 confirmed virus cases, including 558 new ones from the previous day, and 643 deaths in the pandemic.  ___ HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: NEW DELHI \u2014 India reported another 86,508 new coronavirus cases, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi sees little merit in imposing even short local lockdowns. India now has confirmed more than 5.7 million cases, the second-most in the world. The Health Ministry also said Thursday that 1,129 more people have died, for a total of 91,149. India's junior Railways Minister Suresh Angadi died on Wednesday, nearly two weeks after he was admitted to a New Delhi hospital with COVID-19. He was the first federal minister and the fourth Indian lawmaker to die from the disease. Modi on Wednesday decried short, local lockdowns imposed in some places and said the country needs to not only keep fighting the virus, but also move ahead boldly on the economic front. He asked states to focus on testing, tracing, treatment and surveillance. He said lockdown restrictions hit smooth movement of goods and services, including medical supplies. ___ SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom is allowing health officials to hide their addresses under a California program designed to protect people from harassment or violence.  Newsom signed an executive order Wednesday permitting the secretary of state to make the Safe at Home program available to local health officers and other public health officials.  The program provides substitute mailing addresses for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, among others.  The governor's office says making public health officials eligible can protect those on the front lines of fighting the virus. ___ BEIJING \u2014 Foreigners holding certain types of visas and residence permits will be permitted to return to China starting next week as the threat of coronavirus continues to recede. The new regulation lifts a months-long blanket suspension covering most foreigners apart from diplomats and those in special circumstances. Beginning Monday, foreign nationals holding valid Chinese visas and residence permits for work, personal matters and family reunions will be permitted to enter China without needing to apply for new visas, according to the regulation. Those whose permits have expired can reapply. Returnees must undergo two weeks of quarantine. The announcement was made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Immigration Administration on Wednesday. China has confirmed 85,314 cases of COVID-19 since the virus was detected in Wuhan late last year. The seven new cases reported Thursday were all imported, marking 39 days since the country has reported a case of domestic transmission. 7 Tech Stocks To Buy On Sale[1]This too shall pass. Those four words should be taped to the computer screen of every investor. If you own shares of the tech sector, you've seen your portfolio take quite a hit. Tech stocks were largely immune from the effects of the pandemic. However, as investors are looking to rebalance their portfolios, tech stocks were obvious targets for some profit-taking. And at the end of the day, that's what I believe the latest tech selloff amounts to. Stocks don't move in one direction all the time. Sure, there may be some saber-rattling about breaking up big tech. But with an election in less than two months, nobody will have the political will to do anything. That doesn't mean that it's all going to be smooth sailing. Sure, the Federal Reserve did its part by promising low-interest rates until the end of time (or at least through 2023 whatever comes first). But the rest of 2020 is likely to be volatile for stocks. First, there's still the novel coronavirus hanging around. It's not going to simply disappear after election day. That will take some combination of a vaccine and/or therapeutic. And all the likely candidates seem to be getting farther away the deeper into clinical trials they get. And we have an election. But we are not likely to know the winner of the election on election night. In fact, for those who remember the spectacle of 'hanging chads', this election could make that one look like amateur hour. The bottom line is there will be uncertainty. But there are always gains to be found, particularly now that their stock price has come down a little bit. Here are seven tech stocks that you can look to add or increase a position in now that they're trading at a discount. View the \"7 Tech Stocks To Buy On Sale\"[2].

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano)WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 now exceeds the number of American service members who died in World War I.  The current pandemic mortality tally for the United States from Johns Hopkins University reached 116,526 on Tuesday. The number of Americans who died in World War I is 116,516. Both figures are far from precise, due to a lack of testing during the pandemic and the challenges of counting the dead in the trenches of World War I a century ago.  But historians and the Congressional Research Service believe that 116,516 is the best figure for WWI battlefield deaths ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 The German government wants to require any cases of the coronavirus in pets to be reported to authorities.  \u2014 Tanzania's president says the country will reopen schools at the end of this month after claiming victory over COVID-19 and that divine intervention is key to stopped the virus. </p><p> \u2014 China reimposes some travel restrictions in the capital to contain a new outbreak, highlighting calls for vigilance as the U.S., Europe and Latin America continue to reopen. \u2014 Americans are unhappier today than they've been in nearly 50 years. That's the takeaway from the COVID Response Tracking Study conducted by University of Chicago researchers. It finds that just 14% of American adults say they're very happy, down from 31% who said the same in 2018. About twice as many Americans reported being lonely as did in two years ago, an unsurprising finding given lockdowns and stay-home orders.  \u2014 Scientists at Imperial College London will start immunizing people in Britain this week with an experimental coronavirus shot, while pharmaceutical company Sanofi and the French government announced more than 800 million euros ($890 million) in investment as part of the worldwide race to find an effective vaccine. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.\u2014 Health care workers are reckoning with the psychological toll of fighting the virus. While the global pandemic hasn't abated, the days of ventilator shortages and makeshift morgues at hospitals have subsided. Not necessarily the pain from treating gasping patients in past months and fears that COVID-19 could flare anew later this year. ___ Follow AP pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url> ___ HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 The prospect of hosting the first rally for U.S. President Donald Trump in months would be a delight for many mayors in deep-red states like Oklahoma, but Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum isn't celebrating. Other Oklahoma GOP officials are hailing Trump's planned rally at Tulsa's 19,000-seat BOK Center arena on Saturday. But Bynum finds himself in a precarious position, balancing partisan politics, the city's deep racial wounds and a spiking coronavirus infection rate. The mayor has been strident about avoiding large group and says he won't attend the Trump rally. Bynum said in a statement posted Tuesday on Facebook that he had no plans to prevent the event by invoking civil emergency authority. He also said he was unaware of plans for a rally until arena management reached out to the city regarding police support. The mayor wrote: 'I would have loved some other city to have proven the safety of such an event already.' ___ LAS VEGAS \u2014 Nevada is reporting its single largest daily increase of new cases of coronavirus after the governor announced he would hold off on easing any more restrictions in the state. Health officials said Tuesday that 379 new confirmed cases were reported statewide Monday. Before that, the largest one-day increase was 295 cases on May 22. The state Department of Health and Human Services said the increase can be partially attributed to delayed reporting from the weekend but is also part of an upward trend of new cases the state has seen in the last three weeks.  Nevada's casinos reopened almost two weeks ago after being shuttered for 11 weeks. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Monday night that current customer limits for businesses, social distancing guidance and limits on gatherings of more than 50 people would remain in place at least until June 30. ___ MILAN \u2014 The number of patients being treated for COVID-19 in Italian intensive care units has dropped to its lowest levels since Italy's government ordered a nationwide lockdown.  The number of ICU patients in Italy's hospitals dropped below 200 for the first time since March 2, to 177. That's an 80% improvement from the March peak.  About 3,300 others also remained hospitalized on Tuesday, nearly 200 fewer than a day earlier. The civil protection agency said Italy added 210 new confirmed cases from Monday to Tuesday, bringing its epidemic total to 237,500. There also were another 34 deaths.  Experts have said those figures are likely to be much lower than the real infection level, because only people hospitalized or showing strong symptoms are tested. ___ HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 Pennsylvania has recorded a third straight day of fewer than 400 positive coronavirus tests, according to Department of Health data. That's the longest such stretch since new confirmed cases in the state began regularly exceeding that number l in late March.  Still, the number of people dying with the virus every day remains in the dozens. Officials reported 33 additional deaths and 362 new confirmed cases on Tuesday. That brings the state's totals to nearly 80,000 cases and 6,276 deaths since early March. Of those, 75% have recovered, the department said. The number of infections is thought to be far higher than the state's confirmed case count because many people have not been tested and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a couple of weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. ___ MEMPHIS, Tenn.\u2014 The number of COVID-19 patients in Tennessee hospitals has reached its highest level at more than 400, but Vanderbilt University researchers report the increase has not put acute strain on the state's hospital system. A report from the Nashville-based university's hospital and medical school issued Tuesday said increases in hospitalizations in June were mostly concentrated in the Memphis area and southeast Tennessee, including Chattanooga.  Around 400 patients were hospitalized between June 7 and June 13, a jump of nearly 30% from a week earlier, the report said. Increasing numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in recent days have led the cities of Memphis and Nashville to delay plans to reopen more businesses and to raise customer limits at restaurants and retail stores. ___ FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 Florida's confirmed coronavirus cases has risen sharply again and set a daily record weeks after the state began restarting its economy. The state Department of Health reported 2,783 new confirmed cases on Tuesday, breaking the record of 2,581 new cases set on Friday. The numbers on both days are almost double the previous high of 1,601 set in mid-May. Florida's has spread to the team that operates United States' hurricane hunter airplanes. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials said Tuesday that five employees at the team's Lakeland, Florida, base tested positive last week, forcing others into quarantine. Gov. Ron DeSantis last week said the upward trend in confirmed cases was mostly a reflection of more testing for the virus combined with spikes in some agriculture communities. But the number of tests performed daily peaked three weeks ago, and the percentage of positive tests is now over 6%, more than double the 2.3% rate in late May.  The Florida health department has not responded to multiple phone and email requests for comment from The Associated Press. \u2014\u2014 LONDON \u2014 Britain is making available to people in the country's National Health Service a drug that has been shown to improve chances of survival for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.  A large U.K. clinical trial has found that a cheap, widely available steroid called dexamethasone reduced deaths by up to one-third in hospitalized patients who needed oxygen.  The U.K. Department of Health said Tuesday that effective immediately, the drug had been approved to treat all hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen. The department said the U.K. had stockpiled enough to treat 200,000 patients. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the drug was the 'biggest breakthrough yet' in treating COVID-19. Johnson spent a week in the hospital being treated himself.  Peter Horby of Oxford University, one of the leaders of the trial, told a news conference that dexamethasone had shown 'quite a significant effect' in patients with respiratory difficulties. It's also readily available. Horby said that 'it's on almost every pharmacy shelf in every hospital, it's available throughout the world, and it's very cheap.' ___ THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 Dutch lawmakers have called for an independent review of the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis so authorities can be better prepared for a possible second wave of infections. In a vote Tuesday, a majority of lawmakers supported a motion by the opposition Labor and Socialist parties calling on the Netherlands' governing coalition to seek independent advice before Sept. 1 on 'what lessons can be learned' from the measures taken by the government to rein in the spread of the virus. Nearly 50,000 people have tested positive for the virus in the Netherlands and 6,070 have died, according to the government's official tally. The pandemic's actual death tolls in many countries are believed to be higher because not all people who died with suspected COVID-19 were tested. The Dutch Safety Board, an independent panel that investigates major incidents such as plane crashes and industrial accidents, also is investigating the government's coronavirus response but its probe is expected to take many months. ___ TORONTO \u2014 Canada and the United States have agreed to keep borders closed to non-essential travel until July 21 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that the two countries extended their existing agreement by another 30 days.  The border restrictions were announced on March 18 and previously extended in April and May. Many Canadians fear a reopening.  The U.S. has more confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 than any country in the world, ___ ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Greek authorities say more than 7,800 coronavirus tests were carried out on passengers who arrived at Athens international Airport last week and turned up four cases. Authorities said the 7,804 checks were carried out on flights that arrived June 8-14, before Greece opened to most European tourists this week without compulsory coronavirus tests. Greece has been eager to promote itself as a safe tourist destination, and to salvage what is left of the summer tourist season. The country is heavily dependent on tourism, which makes up around 20% of its economy. Tourists have been able to fly into Athens and the northern city of Thessaloniki since Monday, and are subject to random coronavirus tests rather than mandatory testing and quarantine. International flights will be able to fly directly to regional airports from July 1. ___ NAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Tanzania's president says the country will reopen schools at the end of this month after claiming victory over COVID-19.  President John Magufuli's comments came a day after his prime minister said 66 people in Tanzania were still infected. Confusion has surrounded the East African nation after it stopped publicly updating its number of cases at the end of April.  Magufuli has claimed the pandemic has been greatly exaggerated and pressed ahead with loosening restrictions in Tanzania, a country of some 56 million people. He says precautions such as wearing masks are unnecessary and instead divine intervention is key to stopping the virus.  Health experts have pleaded with the government for cooperation and transparency.  While Tanzania's official number of cases has been frozen at just over 500, opposition leaders fear the real number is in the tens of thousands.  ___ BEIJING \u2014 The head of the World Health Organization is scheduled to deliver a graduation address to business students at one of China's premier universities amid U.S. accusations that he and the U.N. health agency gave in to undue influence from Beijing. Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management announced that WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will address students remotely on Sunday. Tedros earlier publicly praised the Chinese response as 'very impressive, and beyond words.' U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to suspend funding for the WHO after saying the agency had echoed China's claims that it was responding swiftly to the coronavirus even as information appears to show Beijing covered up or delayed passing on data about its outbreak. The AP found significant delays by China in the early stages of the country's outbreak that compromised the WHO's understanding of how it was spreading, according to internal recordings of WHO meetings, documents and interviews. ___ MOSCOW \u2014 Outdoor spaces in cafes and restaurants, museums and zoos have reopened in Russia's capital as part of easing coronavirus restrictions.  Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said last week that the city government would end the lockdown it imposed in late March. The steps taken Tuesday also allowed dental clinics to resume providing non-urgent treatment. Kindergartens, gyms and the indoor spaces of cafes and restaurants in Moscow are set to reopen starting June 23.  Moscow authorities cited the decrease in new confirmed virus cases as the reason why stay-home orders and other restrictions could end. The daily number of new confirmed cases in Moscow has dropped from over 6,000 to under 1,500 in recent weeks. However, Kremlin critics link the move to the Russian government's desire to boost voter turnout in an upcoming constitutional referendum that would allow President Vladimir Putin' to rule until 2036. Voting is set to start on June 25. ___ PARIS \u2014 Drug maker Sanofi pledged Tuesday to invest 610 million euros ($677 million) in vaccine facilities in France, as President Emmanuel Macron announced 200 million euros ($222 million) in government investments to reduce France's dependence on other countries for vaccines and other medicines. Sanofi said its investment would go into a vaccine production site and a new vaccine research center, to be able to produce in greater scale and 'quickly respond to future pandemic risks.' Macron said starting Thursday, France will 'relocalize' production of some medicines as part of broader government efforts to revive the virus-battered economy and bring more manufacturing production back to France.  Sanofi is working on a vaccine it hopes to test on humans later this year. one of dozens of vaccine candidates being pursued around the world. Last month, Sanofi prompted outrage in France by promising to give the United States first access to the company's eventual vaccine because the U.S. had invested more in its research.  ___ DHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh on Tuesday reported 53 new deaths from coronavirus in a day, the highest in a daily count, bringing the death toll to 1,262. Nasima Sultana of the Health Directorate said 3,862 people tested positive, raising the total caseload to 94,481.  The new figures came amid calls to control new infections by locking down many areas in the capital, Dhaka, and elsewhere. Bangladesh, a nation of 160 million, has only 61 laboratories for testing. Experts say the country's healthcare facilities have already been overwhelmed. ___ JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia has surpassed 40,000 coronavirus cases but will allow some schools to reopen. A spokesman for the national COVID-19 task force, Achmad Yurianto, said there are 1,106 new COVID-19 cases in Indonesia in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 40,400 cases and 2,231 deaths.  The government will allow schools in '#8216;green zone' areas to reopen, which includes about 6% of students. But Education and Culture Minister Nadiem Makarim said 94% of the students in Indonesia cannot have face-to-face academic activitiesl as they are located in 429 districts in high and medium-risk areas. The new school year is scheduled to begin on July 13. ___ BERLIN \u2014 The German government plans to introduce an obligation that any cases of coronavirus in pets be reported to authorities. It says the move is needed to assist research into the virus. Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner said Tuesday that the plan is for the move to be considered by parliament next month. Kloeckner said that there will be no obligation for people to test their pets, but it would make sense to do so in certain situations - for example, if a cat living in a household with human coronavirus cases itself shows symptoms. She stressed there's no evidence so far that pets can transmit COVID-19 to humans. Germany has about 31 million pets and 83 million people. The head of the country's animal disease research center said there has only been one known animal case there so far. ___ LONDON \u2014 Scientists at Imperial College London will start immunizing people in Britain this week with their experimental coronavirus shot, becoming the latest entry into the race to find an effective vaccine to stop the pandemic. In a statement, the British government said 300 healthy people will be immunized with two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed at Imperial, which has been backed by 41 million pounds ($51 million) in government funding. So far, the vaccine candidate developed by Imperial College London has only been tested in animals and in the laboratory, where it produced much higher levels of antibodies than would normally be seen in infected people.  ___ KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The wife of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been hospitalized with double-sided pneumonia after getting infected with the new coronavirus. Zelenskiy's office said in a statement Tuesday that Olena Zelenska's condition was stable and the president himself and the couple's children tested negative for the virus on Monday. Zelenska said she tested positive for the virus on Friday. Ukraine's authorities started to gradually ease lockdown restrictions in late May, resuming the operation of public transport, reopening malls and gyms. On Monday, the country's authorities resumed international flights to several countries. ___ ISLAMABAD \u2014 Authorities in Pakistan are taking action to seal off high-risk areas in the country's 20 biggest cities after an increase in coronavirus infections. Pakistan's National Command and Control Center says raids are being carried out to impose fines and shut markets, industries and shops where social distancing regulations were being violated. The sealing of high-risk areas began after Pakistan reported a big jump in COVID-19 deaths and a steady increase in infections. Pakistan put its entire population of 220 million under lockdown from March until last month, when Prime Minister Imran Khan's government loosened restrictions, saying it was necessary to save the country's economy. On Tuesday, Pakistan reported 111 new COVID-19 fatalities. It raised the overall death toll from the virus to 2,839 among 148,921 confirmed cases. ___ JOHANNESBURG \u2014 Africa's coronavirus cases are now above a quarter-million after South Africa registered a series of daily record-high new cases over the weekend.  South Africa further loosened its lockdown measures on June 1, allowing alcohol sales, more business openings and religious gatherings limited to 50 people.  The country has more than a quarter of the cases on the 54-nation African continent with more than 73,000. It saw its highest jump in cases on Sunday with more than 4,300.  South Africa's struggle to balance measures to slow the spread of the virus and relieve economic pain are common throughout Africa, where the World Health Organization last week said the pandemic is now 'accelerating.' ___ NEW DELHI \u2014 India recorded another 10,000-plus coronavirus infections as patients swamp health services in its largest cities. The Health Ministry on Tuesday also reported a 24-hour increase of 380 deaths due to COVID-19, driving the death toll to 9,900. The 10,667 new cases raise the nation's total to 343,091, fourth-highest in the world behind the U.S., Brazil and Russia.  Maharashtra, the western state that is home to Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital, continues to have the highest state toll.  New Delhi is a growing concern with the federal government criticizing its contact tracing and hospital capacity. The capital has about 10,000 beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients, half of which are already occupied. Hotels and sports stadiums are being considered for use as field hospitals. ___ WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 New Zealand is no longer free from the new coronavirus after two women who flew from London to see a dying parent tested positive. The new cases sparked a round of testing for anybody who might have been close to them, including their flight's fellow passengers and crew, staff members at a hotel and a family member.  The women are isolated and have delayed the funeral of their parent until they have recovered.  New Zealand has counted 22 deaths from COVID-19, and until Tuesday, everyone else among the 1,500 people known to have been infected had recovered. 8 Pharmaceutical Companies Working on a Coronavirus Cure[1]We are living through interesting times. Not an hour goes by when Americans don't receive some reminder of the impact the coronavirus has on our lives. The race is on for an effective, FDA-approved treatment for the virus. Despite, vaccines being available for human trial in record time, we are many months away from having a viable vaccine. However, we may be somewhat closer in finding some antiviral treatments. And if you've watched the market closely this week, any news on that front tends to move the market in a positive direction. That brings up another truth of investing. There are some stocks that thrive from other stocks misery. And that's why we've put together this special report. If you're an investor who is looking to jump into this bear market, the pharmaceutical sector is a logical choice. A combination of big-name drug companies as well as smaller startup companies are working around the clock to develop vaccines or treatments that will target the infection caused by the novel coronavirus.

Addressing spikes in reported coronavirus cases in some states, Azar said people \u201chave to take ownership\u201d of their own behaviors by social distancing and wearing masks if possible.    He says Trump doesn\u2019t have to follow his own administration\u2019s guidance because as a leader of the free world he\u2019s tested regularly and is in \u201cvery different circumstances than the rest of us.\u201d    Azar declined to say whether he\u2019s ever asked Trump to wear a mask. He told CNN and NBC that his own message to the people is to take precautions for \u201cpublic health.\u201d    Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee says Trump should spend more time tweeting about wearing masks instead of monuments. Inslee tells CBS: \u201cWe need a president who will care more about living Americans and less about dead Confederates.\u201d    ___    HERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:    \u2014 Virus cases worldwide hit 10 million    \u2014 Businesses weigh reopening - or close again - as reported virus cases rise    \u2014 Experts look to set expectations on any virus vaccine    \u2014 Experts see no proof of child-abuse surge amid pandemic    \u2014 A divided Poland holds presidential vote delayed by pandemic, while France holds municipal elections.    \u2014 Nurses, doctors feel strain as virus races through Arizona    \u2014 The pandemic means that millions of women in Africa and other developing regions could lose years of success in contributing to household incomes, asserting their independence and expanding financial inclusion.    ___    Follow all of AP's pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url>   (Ad)  The next big tech trend that could explode in today\u2019s new economy is coming to your hometown \u2013 which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.    ___    HERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:    ROME \u2014 Italy has added 174 more confirmed infections and 22 deaths to the official coronavirus toll in the onetime epicenter of Europe\u2019s outbreak.    Sunday\u2019s Health Ministry update confirmed a weekslong general trend of hard-hit northern regions still tallying the most new confirmed infections while southern regions register single digit increases or none at all.    Lombardy topped the list again with 97 new infections, followed by 21 in Emilia-Romagna. There, officials are trying to control and trace a cluster that originated in a courier company that has reported dozens of infections this week.    Eight southern regions reported no new infections over the last 24 hours. Five others reported just one new case. All told Italy has reported 240,310 confirmed infections and 34,738 dead.    ___    JOHANNESBURG \u2014 Africa\u2019s confirmed cases of COVID-19 have climbed to a new high of more than 371,000, including includes 9,484 deaths.    The African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released those figures Sunday.    South Africa has more than 1/3 of the continent\u2019s cases. It reported 7,210 new cases, its highest single daily increase to date. A statement from Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize says South Africa now has 131,800 confirmed cases, including 2,413 deaths for a mortality rate of 1.8%.    The Western Cape province, including Cape Town, has 45% of the cases. But Gauteng province, including the country\u2019s largest city, Johannesburg, and the capital, Pretoria, is experiencing a surge of the virus, taking it to 26% of the country\u2019s cases.    The more rural Eastern Cape province currently has 18% of South Africa\u2019s cases.    ___    ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Greek authorities have reported 10 new coronavirus cases since Saturday afternoon, but no new deaths.    Total confirmed cases now stand at 3,376, with 191 deaths. Ten patients are on ventilators and 119 have exited intensive care units.    Despite being widely commended for having successfully contained the spread of the pandemic, Greek authorities are still wary. There are several reports of people flouting social distancing rules, and local alerts, such as the one Sunday on an island close to the capital Athens, where a test on an arrival from abroad came up positive, but not before the person had already been at a well-attended local funeral.    ___    WASHINGTON \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is stressing that \u201cthe window is closing\u201d for the U.S. to take action to effectively curb the coronavirus.    Azar pointed to a recent spike in infections, particularly in the South. He says people have \u201cto act responsibly\u201d by social distancing and wearing face masks especially \u201cin these hot zones.\u201d    Azar argued that the U.S. is in a better position than two months ago in fighting the virus because it is conducting more testing and has therapeutics available to treat COVID-19.    But he acknowledges that hospitalizations and deaths could increase in the next few weeks, because it is a lagging indicator.    Texas and Florida reversed course on parts of their reopening and clamped down on bars on Friday as the daily number of confirmed coronavirus infections in the U.S. surged to an all-time high of 40,000.    Azar spoke on NBC and CNN.    ___    ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 A Maryland man who has helped organize \u201creopen\u201d protests against measures intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus says he has the virus.    Tim Walters is a co-founder of the ReOpen Maryland movement. The Capital Gazette and Washington Post report that he announced on social media that he has tested positive.    In a Facebook video, he said he was diagnosed at a hospital emergency room. The newspapers report that he said, \u201cHere I am months after not wearing a mask at rallies, churches and so on and so it\u2019s funny how capricious this thing is.\u201d    Walters declined interview requests from the papers. He said he would not provide any information to public health officials trying to trace the spread of the disease. Walters emphasized he had contacted people he\u2019d recently interacted with.    ___    BERLIN \u2014 The southern German state of Bavaria says it\u2019s starting a program to offer coronavirus testing for all residents.    State Health Minister Melanie Huml said Sunday that the \u201ccorona test offensive\u201d will help provide Bavarians \u201cclarity if they have been infected.\u201d    Bavaria is Germany\u2019s largest state by area and is home to some 13 million people. It has been the worst hit by the coronavirus both in terms of infections per capita and in total numbers.    As of Sunday, the Robert Koch Institute, Germany\u2019s disease control center, reported the state had 48,294 of Germany\u2019s overall 193,499 cases, with 2,592 of its 8,957 deaths.    Bavaria is the first of Germany\u2019s 16 states to undertake universal testing. Until now, testing has been focused on people with symptoms or possible exposure, as well as in certain professions where they are more likely to have come into contact with the virus.    ___    MOSCOW \u2014 Russia has recorded 6,791 new cases in the past day.    The national coronavirus task force said Sunday that the total number of cases rose to 634,437.    It said 104 people died of the virus over the past day, bringing the total dead to 9.073.    Russia has the third-highest coronavirus infection case count in the world. But it has reported far fewer deaths than many countries with smaller infection case counts, leading to speculation that figures are manipulated which Russian officials vehemently deny.    ___    LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s government is pledging to support local officials the central English city of Leicester, amid reports that a spike in COVID-19 cases would prompt authorities to lock the community down.    The Sunday Times reports that a lockdown would come within days after 658 new cases were recorded in the Leicester area in the two weeks to June 16. It would be the first time Britain had locked down a single area during the pandemic.    The Department of Health and Social Care on Sunday acknowledged the city was an area of concern. It says it is \u201csupporting the council and local partners in Leicester to help prevent further transmission of the virus.\u201d    ___    Confirmed coronavirus infections have surpassed the 10 million mark worldwide.    A tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University registered the grim milestone Sunday, after India and Russia added thousands of new cases. The United States has confirmed more than 2.5 million infections, the most in the world.    Globally, the Hopkins tally has reported nearly 500,000 deaths.    While Hopkins reports only confirmed coronavirus cases, experts believe the true number of people who have been infected could be as much as 10 times that figure, given that so many people can\u2019t get tested or may have the virus without showing any symptoms.    ___    PRAGUE \u2014 The Czech Republic has been registering a steep increase of the number of people infected with the coronavirus.    The day-to-day increase reached 260 new confirmed cases on Saturday, up from 168 the previous day and 93 the day before.    It is the highest number of newly infected people since April 8. It comes amid the government\u2019s easing of its restrictive measures and despite a typical lower number of tests over the weekend.    The Czech Republic has had 11,306 confirmed cases while 347 people have died, according to Health Ministry figures released on Sunday.    ___    ROME \u2014 Italy is honoring its coronavirus dead with a Requiem concert performed in front of the cemetery in Bergamo, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the onetime epicenter of the European outbreak.    President Sergio Mattarella, the 243 mayors of cities in Bergamo province and a representative of families who lost loved ones have been invited to attend the evening concert, which is being transmitted live on RAI state television. It will feature the Requiem Mass composed by Bergamo native Gaetano Donizetti, one of Italy\u2019s most important 19th century composers.    Bergamo recorded its first positive case Feb. 23. By the end of March had registered a 571% increase in excess deaths compared with the five-year monthly average.    Donizetti composed the unfinished Requiem to honor friend fellow composer Vincenzo Bellini, who died in 1835.    ___    NEW DELHI \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi says India must focus on bolstering the economy as it exits the lockdown phase, even as the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb.    On Sunday, India reported additional 19,906 confirmed cases, taking the total to 528,859 with 16,095 deaths. It says 309,713 people have recovered.    Modi told a radio address that during the post-lockdown period, Indians have to stay more vigilant compared to the lockdown and only alertness can save them from the coronavirus.    He again urged people to wear a mask and observe social distancing norms and other precautions, or else would be putting others at risk, especially the elderly and children at home.    ___    BERLIN \u2014 Swiss authorities say they\u2019ve ordered 300 people into quarantine after a \u201csuperspreader\u201d outbreak of the new coronavirus at a Zurich nightclub.    Zurich officials said in a statement that a man who had been at the Flamingo Club a week ago tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, and that five people who were with him there were then tested and also were positive and reported to authorities on Friday.    Working from a list of guests provided by the club, officials were then able to get in touch with the others who were there and ordered them into quarantine on Saturday for 10 days to try and stop any further spread of the virus as they are tested.    Swiss officials say the incident shows how important it is to stick to hygiene and distance regulations as lockdown measures are gradually lifted.   8 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now   Dividend stocks are always in fashion. Income investors find that dividend stocks can be a replacement for low-yielding Treasury bonds and other bond options. But dividend stocks can also play a role in the growth investor\u2019s portfolio. Dividend stocks by nature tend to lag behind the broader market. This is due to the nature of the companies that issue dividends. In many cases, these are mature companies who have the liquidity to not only use profits for growth but also to reward shareholders.   However, in a bull market dividend stocks can also provide a significant amount of growth. This can provide investors of all styles with a nice total return. For those that are new to dividend stocks, it\u2019s important to know what to look for in a dividend stock. Yield is important, but it\u2019s not everything.   What you\u2019re looking for is a company that has a proven history of not only issuing dividends but ideally increasing the amount of those dividends on an annual basis.   In this presentation, we\u2019ll highlight eight dividend stocks in various sectors that are the best to buy. And for most of these stocks, they\u2019re a good buy today and well into the future.

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF THE HOUR: __ Venezuela sees its largest one-day virus increase \u2014 Atlanta zoo opens outdoor exhibits. </p><p>\u2014 Louisiana governor releases proposal to close budget gap. \u2014 8 more sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt test positive again. \u2014 Washington state death total reaches 1,000. ___ CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela is reporting its biggest one-day increase in confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic hit the South American nation. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said Saturday that the 45 new cases bring Venezuela's total to 504 illnesses, with 10 resulting in death. Officials have reported a relatively low number of cases since the first were discovered in mid-March.  While Venezuela has reported relatively few cases so far, health experts say its hospitals are especially vulnerable to being overwhelmed. Venezuela is in a deep political and economic crisis that has left its health care system in a shamble. President Nicols Maduro ordered a nationwide lockdown shortly after the first cases, and he recently extended it until mid-June, hoping to contain the virus' spread.  Officials say that 35 of Saturday's cases involved people returning to Venezuela, including several on a flight from Peru. ___ BEIJING \u2014 China on Sunday reported five new cases of coronavirus, as the commercial hub of Shanghai announced the restart of classes for kindergarteners, first-, second- and third-graders from June 2.  Also, airlines say they have seen a revival of flights. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.  Of the new cases, two were imported and three were domestic infections in the northeastern province of Jilin that has seen a small spike in cases of unknown origin.  In Shanghai, students retain the option of continuing to follow classes online rather than facing virus testing and social distancing measures to be imposed at schools. As in Beijing and other cities, Shanghai has already re-started classes for middle and high school students preparing for exams.  No new deaths have been reported for the past month, but Jilin added one fatality retroactively, bringing China's total to 4,634 out of 82,947 cases reported since the outbreak was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Just 86 people remain hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19 while another 519 people are in supervised isolation for showing signs of the virus or having tested positive without displaying symptoms.  China now has the capacity to perform 1.5 million nucleic acid tests per day, National Health Commission Guo Yanhong told reporters Saturday. The commission is placing a new emphasis on bio-safety, management of laboratories and training of personnel, Guo said. Meanwhile, the number of domestic flights has returned to 60 percent of pre-outbreak levels, exceeding 10,000 per day for the first time since Feb. 1, the country's civil aviation regulator reported. The number of flight hit 10,262 on Friday, up from a low of 3,931 flights on Feb. 13, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said. No passenger numbers were given.  With the summer holidays approaching, numerous tourist sites have re-opened, including Beijing's storied Forbidden City palace complex and Shanghai's Disneyland resort, although with strict social distancing measures still in place. ___ ATLANTA \u2014 Outdoor exhibits along a one-way flow for visitors at Zoo Atlanta opened Saturday for the first time since mid-March, but indoor habitats, rides, playgrounds and other attractions remain closed because of COVID-19. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the zoo is limiting the number of visitors by requiring them to make reservations with specific times to enter the park. Zoo employees had to answer a health survey and have their temperatures taken before returning to work.  Zoo Atlanta deputy director Hayley Murphy says disinfectant is used on the grounds every 60 to 90 minutes and every hour in restrooms. ___ BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards' proposal to close a $1 billion budget gap caused by the coronavirus pandemic would avoid deep cuts to health care and education programs by relying on hundreds of millions in federal relief aid and a portion of the state's 'rainy day' fund. Under the plan offered by Edwards, Louisiana would use nearly $1.2 billion in federal assistance approved by Congress to respond to the pandemic and about $90 million from the rainy day fund to fill most of the gaps in the state's $30 billion-plus budget. The recommendations would require only modest reductions in the financial year that begins July 1. The free college tuition program, K-12 schools and the social services department would be spared cuts entirely, though college campuses and health programs would take hits. The Edwards administration submitted its reworked budget proposal to legislative leaders Friday night. ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 Eight more sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive a second time for the new coronavirus, raising to 13 the number who appear to have become infected again while serving aboard the sidelined aircraft carrier. All the sailors had previously tested positive and had gone through at least two weeks of isolation. Before they were allowed to go back to the ship, all had to test negative twice in a row, with the tests separated by at least a day or two. On Saturday, a Navy official confirmed eight additional sailors had tested positive again. A day earlier the Navy had said in a statement that five had tested positive a second time. The Navy official was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity. ___ SANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 The loosening of some restrictions imposed on nonessential businesses by New Mexico's governor to slow the coronavirus outbreak's spread took effect Saturday, along with a new edict that people wear masks in public under most circumstances.  State officials reported six additional deaths from the outbreak and 185 additional COVID-19 cases.  The loosening of restrictions applied to most of the state but not in the northwest region, where much of the outbreak is centered. Retailers and many services, along with houses of worship, can reopen at limited capacity.  Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ordered that face masks be worn in public, except with exceptions that include eating, drinking and exercising. ___ SEATTLE \u2014 The number of deaths in Washington state because of the new coronavirus has reached 1,000.  The Washington State Department of Health on Saturday added eight more deaths and listed the total number of confirmed cases at 18,288.  The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was in the state on Jan. 20 when a man tested positive. He had been traveling in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak appears to have originated and had returned to the Seattle area five days earlier.  The Seattle area also saw the nation's first deadly coronavirus cluster at a nursing home. The Life Care Center of Kirkland was linked to more than 40 deaths. ___ GREENVILLE, N.C. \u2014 A federal judge on Saturday blocked the enforcement of restrictions that North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper ordered affecting indoor religious services during the coronavirus pandemic. The order from Judge James C. Dever III came days after two Baptist churches, a minister and a Christian revival group filed a federal lawsuit seeking to immediately block enforcement of rules within the Democratic governor's executive orders regarding religious services. Dever agreed with the plaintiffs, who argued that the limits violate their right to worship freely and treat churches differently from retailers and other secular activities. Cooper's latest order still largely prevented most faith organizations from holding indoor services attended by more than 10 people. His office had said the newest order stating permitted services may 'take place outdoors unless impossible' carries only a narrow exception, such as when religious activities dictate they occur indoors with more people. Cooper's spokesman, Ford Porter, said the governor's office disagrees with the decision but will not appeal. ___ SAN FRANCISCO -- More parks and hiking trails welcomed visitors again in California, and one city declared itself a 'sanctuary' from the state's stay-at-home order as diverse regions carved their own path toward reopening. Officials in Atwater, a city of 30,000 in central California, unanimously agreed not to enforce a nearly 2-month-old order intended to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. That means local authorities won't interfere with any business or church that decides to reopen ahead of state restrictions.  The declaration was a symbolic gesture of defiance against Gov. Gavin Newson's order, and the city's mayor cautioned that businesses were taking their own risks by reopening. California is moving through the second phase of relaxing its restrictions. Businesses deemed lower risk have been gradually allowed to reopen, with retailers offering curbside pickup.  ___ ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2014 The results of more than 35,000 COVID-19 tests ordered by a Florida-based health care system and performed by a third-party lab are unreliable, the company said Saturday. According to AdventHealth, a faith-based health care system, the situation has created 'unacceptable delays.' AdventHealth didn't name the third-party lab but said it had terminated its contract with the lab.  The tests were a mixture of positive and negative results, and some had been at the lab for a while. About 25,000 of the unreliable tests were in the central Florida area.  AdventHealth president and CEO Terry Shaw said the company will notify patients who are impacted.  AdventHealth has 49 hospitals in nine states. Company spokeswoman Melanie Lawhorn said two of those states are joint venture systems and were not affected by the unreliable testing. ___ CAIRO \u2014 Sudan's Health Ministry has reported the country's highest one-day tally of coronavirus infections, with 325 new COVID-19 patients and six deaths. Saturday's figures have taken the country's tally to 2,289 confirmed cases, including 97 fatalities, the ministry said. A total of 222 were discharged after recovering. Most of the country's COVID-19 patients were in the capital, Khartoum where authorities imposed round-the-clock curfew in April to stem the spread of the virus. Sudan's health care system has been weakened by decades of war and sanctions. The country is still reeling from last year's uprising that toppled longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir. ___ ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey's health ministry says 41 more people have died from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 4,096.  The death rate is the lowest registered since the end of March. Minister Fahrettin Koca also tweeted Saturday that 1,610 new infections were confirmed, which brings the total number of confirmed cases 148,067.  Fifteen provinces, including Istanbul, are on a four-day lockdown. The country has instituted partial lockdowns to combat the novel coronavirus. People under 20 and above 65 have been stuck at home for weeks, though they are now allowed to leave for a few hours on allotted days.  Other easing measures have gone into effect, including the opening of malls, barbershops and hair salons.  The number of provinces under lockdown on weekends and national holidays has dropped from 31 to 15.  ___ ROME \u2014 Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte acknowledged on Saturday that the reopening of the Italian economy brings a risk of new outbreaks of the coronavirus but said ''we must accept it.'' Conte told reporters during a press conference that the nationwide lockdown that began in early March had brought ''the expected results,'' putting the country in a position to expand economic activity in the second phase of reopening.  Stores, bars, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers and museums are among the business and cultural activities that can resume starting Monday. Gyms and swimming pools can reopen a week after. Travel between regions and into Italy from abroad will be permitted starting June 3.  Conte said the country must accept the risks and open before the availability of a vaccine. But an extensive monitoring system is in place and the government would intervene to close areas if there are new outbreaks. ___ ALBANY, N.Y. \u2014 Several dozen protesters gathered in front of the New York state Capitol on Saturday holding American flags and signs demanding that businesses reopen. Gov. Andrew Cuomo began to allow large swaths of northern and central New York to begin reopening on Friday, permitting certain businesses such as construction to open their doors under safety guidelines. But residents in downstate areas hard-hit by cases of COVID-19 remain under tight restrictions as their communities try to lower infection rates and amass enough testing and tracing to reopen in coming weeks. New York's ban on all non-essential gatherings remains in effect.  ___ NEW ORLEANS \u2014 New Orleans began taking its first steps Saturday toward loosening two months of restrictions on businesses, restaurants and houses of worship. The city is restricting buildings to 25% of capacity and requiring restaurants, nail salons and other businesses to only take customers by reservation. Malls and retail stores can reopen, but casinos, video poker, live entertainment and bars are still closed. Officials are still urging people to stay home as much as possible and requiring people to wear masks in public unless exercising. The coronavirus struck New Orleans so quickly in March there were worries the pandemic would overwhelm the state health system. Hospitalizations have been going down for nearly a month, but officials warned a spike in cases or deaths could lead to putting restrictions back in place. ___ CINCINNATI \u2014 Just days after announcing it would end hazard 'hero' pay to front-line workers, Kroger says it will give them extra 'thank you' bonuses. That's according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. The move comes after an outcry from the grocery store's union, which said workers are still risking their lives by coming to work.  The bonus is $400 for full-time workers and $200 for part-time workers, to be paid in two installments, Kroger announced. Hazard pay was a $2-per-hour supplement. The Cincinnati-based grocer estimates the new bonus will provide $130 million to its workers. United Food and Commercial Workers International estimates that nationwide at least 65 grocery workers have died at Kroger and other retailers after contracting the coronavirus. ___ RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 A small plane carrying a doctor sick with COVID-19 crashed in the Brazilian state of Ceara on Friday night, killing all four people on the aircraft, according to online news site G1, citing the state's firefighters. The sick doctor was being transferred to an intensive care unit in his home state of Piaui. Two medical staffers treating him, as well as the pilot, were also on the plane. The Ceara Fire Department and Sao Bernardo municipality, where the plane crashed, did not immediately respond to requests for information. ___ MILAN \u2014 Italy recorded the lowest number of deaths in a 24-hour period since early in its coronavirus lockdown at just 153. That brings the total in the epidemic to 31,763, the civil protection agency reported on Saturday. The last time the death count was that low was March 9, the day after the nationwide lockdown was announced.  The number of confirmed new infections rose by 875 for a total of 224,760, while the number of currently infected dropped to just over 70,000. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.7\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.7</url> Best Stocks to Own Right Now[1]Today, we are inviting you to view our list of the seven best stocks to own for the next thirty days.

Restaurants and bars can only open for sit-down clients from June 1. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno)The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. </p><p>TOP OF THE HOUR: \u2014 White House requiring everyone who enters the West Wing to wear a mask or face covering.  \u2014 Senior administration officials said the U.S. federal government will begin distributing $11 billion from the latest relief bill to boost state testing efforts. \u2014 WHO chief: there are around seven or eight 'top' candidates for a vaccine to combat coronavirus. \u2014 Death toll in Massachusetts passes 5,000. \u2014 Study: Virus death toll in NYC worse than official tally.  \u2014 White House recommends coronavirus testing of more than 1 million nursing home residents and staff in next 2 weeks. ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is requiring everyone who enters the West Wing to wear a mask or face covering after coronavirus scares near President Donald Trump. A memo sent to all staff outlined the new directive Monday after two staffers last week tested positive for COVID-19. The memo says: 'We are requiring everyone who enters the West Wing to wear a mask or facial covering.' Staff will be allowed to remove their face coverings if they sit at least six feet apart from their colleagues. The directive is meant to protect the president, who has refrained from wearing a mask in public and in private. ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 Senior administration officials said the federal government will begin distributing $11 billion from the latest relief bill to boost state testing efforts.  The funds will be allocated based on states' population size and how heavily they have been impacted by the outbreak. (Ad) America's $51 trillion recovery will be of unheard magnitude. Only it's not from a single thing the government is doing. Or even from big corporations. Instead, it's due to one tiny pioneering American company. You won't believe what its made-in-America device does. It's poised to create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech \u2014 combined! For weeks the White House has resisted calls to set specific testing goals or metrics. And President Trump has reiterated that governors are responsible for testing. Administration officials said the federal government is providing states with enough supplies to meet their testing goals.  At a minimum, the White House wants all states testing at least 2% of their populations, though the administration has declined to elaborate on how that number was reached. The U.S. is still struggling to increase testing to the levels that most public health experts say are essential to safely reopen offices, schools, churches, restaurants and other parts of the economy.  Last week, Harvard researchers projected that the nation must conduct 900,000 daily tests by May 15 to be able to track new cases and contain new flare ups. That's more than three times the country's current daily testing rate of about 275,000. ___ UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The World Health Organization chief says there are around seven or eight 'top' candidates for a vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a U.N. Economic and Social Council video briefing on Monday that 'we have more than a hundred candidates, and we are focusing on the few candidates we have which can bring probably better results and accelerating those candidates with better potential.' He did not identify the top candidates for a vaccine against COVID-19. Tedros said the original thinking two months ago was that it may take 12 to 18 months for a vaccine, but an accelerated effort is under way, helped by 7.4 billion euros ($8 billion) pledged a week ago by world leaders, organizations and banks for research, treatment and testing. He said the $8 billion will not be enough, and additional funds will be needed to speed up the development of a vaccine, but more importantly to produce enough 'to make sure that this vaccine reaches everyone \u2014 (and) there's no one left behind.' Tedros stressed that COVID-19 is 'very contagious and it's a killer,' with more than 4 million cases now reported to WHO and almost 275,000 lives lost. While new cases are declining in Western Europe, they are increasing in Eastern Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, the eastern Mediterranean and other regions, he said. ___ BOSTON \u2014 The Massachusetts death toll from COVID-19 surged past 5,000 on Monday even as the state began mapping out plans to gradually restart the state's economy. Massachusetts reported another 129 confirmed COVID-19-related deaths, bringing to 5,108 the total number of deaths recorded in the state since the pandemic's start. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker began outlining a four-phase plan Monday to reopen Massachusetts businesses that have been closed since late March as part of the state's effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The reopening is set to begin May 18 and will require businesses to adopt a series of protocols to maintain the health of workers and customers. ___ NEW YORK \u2014 New York City's death toll from the coronavirus may be thousands of fatalities worse than the official tally kept by the city and state, according to an analysis released Monday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Between mid-March and early May, about 24,000 more people died in the city than researchers would ordinarily expect, based on the season, the report said. That's about 5,300 more deaths than had been previously attributed to the coronavirus during that time period. These so-called 'excess deaths' could have been caused by byproducts of pandemic, the report found, including 'the demand on hospitals and health care providers and public fear related to COVID-19' prompting delays in people seeking or receiving lifesaving care. The report, based on data compiled by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, underscored the challenges authorities face in assessing \u2014 and quantifying \u2014 the human toll of the crisis. Through Sunday, New York City had recorded nearly 14,800 deaths confirmed by a lab test and another nearly 5,200 probable deaths where no test was available, but doctors are sure enough to list the virus on the death certificate. In its analysis, the report released Monday said the 5,293 excess deaths were on top of both confirmed and probable fatalities. ___ SALEM, Ore. \u2014 Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has directed state agencies to prepare for a 17% budget cut because of cratering tax revenues because of the coronavirus outbreak.  'Whether the state will need to implement this level of cuts will be dependent on several factors, most importantly the need for additional federal funding to support state services, including our K-12 public school system,' Brown said in a statement Monday.  The next revenue forecast for Oregon is May 20 and the Democratic governor had previously said she was 'gravely concerned' about the state's ability to deliver basic services in the coming months.  Oregon's economy was booming before the arrival of COVID-19, with unemployment rates at record lows and a $1.5 billion tax surplus. The general fund budget for 2019-2021 is currently about $25 billion. ___ BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Gov. John Bel Edwards is loosening restrictions this upcoming weekend on restaurants, salons and gyms. The Democratic governor announced that he's moving the state away from a 'stay-at-home' position he enacted in late March. The new regulations take effect Friday and are largely in line with the first phase of reopening as envisioned under the White House guidelines provided to states. Businesses newly allowed to open will be limited to one-quarter of their previous capacity, and employees working around customers will have to wear masks. Restaurants will be able to reopen inside seating and table service, but at the 25% capacity level. Tattoo parlors, spas, amusement parks and children's museums will remain closed. The governor said he decided to lessen the constraints because Louisiana, one of the nation's early hot spots for the coronavirus, is seeing consistent declines in new virus cases and hospitalization rates for COVID-19 disease patients.  ___ ROME \u2014 Italy's government has agreed to allow its regional governors to decide what lockdown restrictions within their jurisdiction can be lifted and when.  For weeks, regions, including in the north where the coronavirus outbreak had been heaviest, have been pressing the central government to be allowed to decide what's best for their citizens and businesses.  Giovanni Toti, governor of Liguria, in northwest Italy, tweeted that Premier Giuseppe Conte during a videoconference on Monday had granted their request, so that starting on May 18, 'we can open up activities based on territorial needs.'  Toti said regions must monitor the epidemiological situation of coronavirus cases in deciding what can open or not. Conte has warned citizens that if the infection rate starts rising again, restrictions on businesses or movement can be swiftly re-imposed. Italy's economy was already stagnant before the country was hit by Europe's first outbreak in February. Governors say if some businesses, such as dine-in restaurants and hair salons, can't resume receiving clients again, many might never re-open their doors. ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is recommending that all nursing home residents and staff be tested for the new coronavirus in the next two weeks. Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the White House coronavirus task force, told governors on a video conference call Monday that it's the federal government's strong recommendation that such testing be done. Dr. Deborah Birx, the task force coordinator, told governors to focus over the next two weeks on testing all 1 million nursing home residents. She says the White House will help states that need it. Nursing homes and the elderly have been shown to be especially susceptible to the virus. The Associated Press obtained a recording of the meeting. ___ ROME \u2014 For a fifth straight day on Monday, Italy's daily number of new COVID-19 infections has declined. According to Italian Health Ministry data, there were 744 confirmed new cases registered since Sunday evening.  That number is lower than daily caseloads when contagion containment measures went into effect nationwide in early March.  The country where Europe's outbreak began now has 219,814 cases, a tally that experts say is surely significantly lower than actual infections, since many with mild or moderate coronavirus symptoms didn't get hospitalized or tested.  In recent days, the number of daily new deaths also has been significantly lower than in early weeks, with 179 registered on Monday.  Still, the known death toll is one of the world's highest \u201430,739. Health officials say it will be later this week at earliest before they can assess if a limited easing of lockdown restrictions on citizens' movements, including the opening of public parks last week, has triggered any uptick in infections.  Italy is moving cautiously and gradually in reopening economic sectors and in removing travel limits. ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 Washington DC health officials announced that 117 positive new COVID-19 infections had been identified, bringing the total up to 6,389 with five new deaths for a total of 328.  Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a state of emergency on March 11 and issued a stay-home order on March 30 for Washington's approximately 700,000 residents. Bowser has also announced plans to turn Washington's convention center into a 1,500-bed field hospital. ___ Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she will follow a 'modified quarantine' plan after meeting with Vice President Mike Pence at a time when one of his aides tested positive for coronavirus. Reynolds said that Pence's aide was at the White House when she visited last Wednesday to brief Pence and President Donald Trump on Iowa's response to the pandemic. Reynolds met again with Pence on Friday when he visited Iowa to meet with religious leaders and food executives. Although Pence had just learned of his aide's infection, he didn't wear a mask during his visit and neither did the governor or other Iowa politicians. Reynolds said that she had no contact with Pence's aide when in Washington but that 'out of an abundance of caution' she will take steps to isolate herself. Reynolds said that she tested negative Monday for coronavirus and is feeling healthy. Reynolds said that her temperature will be taken before she enters the State Emergency Operations Center in Johnston, where she's been working. She said that many of her aides will work from home. She said she'll have only 'minimal interactions' with others and will wear a mask and practice social distancing when she does. ___ HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 Gov. Tom Wolf blasted local elected officials who plan to reopen in defiance of his shutdown orders, threatening Monday to yank coronavirus aid and declaring they are 'choosing to desert in the face of the enemy.' The normally mild-mannered Democrat fired back after several counties declared themselves in open rebellion against his restrictions on businesses and movement, saying local officials who pronounce themselves open for business will pay a steep price. 'To those politicians who decide to cave into this coronavirus, they need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act,' said Wolf, threatening to withhold state and federal funding to counties 'that put us all at risk by operating illegally.' Wolf also warned businesses that choose to 'follow the whims of local politicians and ignore the law' by reopening in defiance of the shutdown that they risk businesses licenses, certificates of occupancy and other required governmental approvals to operate. ___ NEW YORK \u2014 Several regions of upstate New York that have shown progress in taming the coronavirus outbreak are ready to gradually restart economic activity by the end of the week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Cuomo shut down the entire state March 22 as the New York City area emerged as a global pandemic hot spot, but the outbreak has been less severe in the state's smaller cities and rural areas. He said three upstate regions have met all criteria for opening some business activity after May 15: the Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley and the Finger Lakes. Other upstate regions are making progress and could follow soon after.  The reopening regions still need to work out logistics, such as creating regional 'control rooms' to monitor the effects of the reopening.  ___ BERLIN \u2014 The German government is making available 750 million euros ($810 million) to speed up the production and development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus. Science minister Anja Karliczek said Monday that about 500 million euros will go into scientific studies and vaccine trials, while 250 million euros will go into expanding production capacities in Germany. Numerous universities and companies worldwide, including in Germany, are rushing to develop a vaccine for the pandemic-causing virus. Germany has recorded more than 170,000 cases and at least 7,484 deaths since the start of the outbreak. ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 The chief of the National Guard Bureau says he tested negative for COVID-19 on Monday, his second consecutive negative result after testing positive on Saturday during screening before a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting at the White House with President Donald Trump.  Gen. Joseph Lengyel said in a brief statement that he was tested Monday at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Washington.  He was one of two members of the Joint Chiefs who missed the Trump meeting because of coronavirus concerns.  The other was Adm. Mike Gilday, the chief of naval operations. Gilday went into quarantine after a family member tested positive for the coronavirus. Gilday tested negative. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.6\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.6</url> Stocks That Will Benefit From a Dovish Federal Reserve[1]The quaint correction that was labeled the 'tech wreck' of 2018 seems like a distant memory to investors. What also seems like a distant memory is any thought of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. At the end of 2018, the Federal Reserve had raised its benchmark federal funds rate. With the trade dispute with China dragging on, there was increasing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. When interest rates are lower, stocks will generally rise as investors have no other option for growth. In July 2019, the doves got their wish. But in a move that now seems to be a 'what did they know move', the Fed dropped rates again in October. The market soared to record highs in January and early February. Since mid-February however, the market has fallen dramatically, and the Fed juiced the market one more time by cutting rates down to levels not seen since the financial crisis. None of us know for sure when the U.S. economy will be opened up. And while stocks are still a good investment, not every stock is a smart investment at this time. But some stocks perform well when interest rates are falling and that's why we've prepared this presentation.

David Cicilline lodged the accusation at the tech company\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Wednesday during a congressional hearing also featuring testimony from the heads of Apple, Amazon and Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cicilline noted a series of popular conspiracy theories \u2014 including that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax \u2014 that have thrived on Facebook's platform during the deadly virus\u2019 grip across the globe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIt brings the most activity which, of course, produces great profit,\u201d Cicilline said to Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg offered assurances that the social network's users don\u2019t want to see misinformation in their feeds, so the company has taken big steps to scrub its site of inaccurate coronavirus claims. But that only invited more push back from Cicilline, noted out that just on Monday the company struggled to take down a video of pro-Trump doctors peddling misleading claims that Americans don\u2019t need to wear masks and an unproven anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a sure-fire way to treat the virus.</p><p>The video raked in more than 20 million views before Facebook started removing it, with dozens of other versions of it still cropping up. Earlier in the hourslong hearing, GOP congressmen had complained that Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took down that same video at all, describing it as censorship.</p><p>Nodding to that political tightrope he\u2019s walking on, Zuckerberg defended the company\u2019s misinformation policies, \u201cwe\u2019ve been quite aggressive in taking some of that down, as some of the questioning from the other side of the aisle has shown so far.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>5:20 p.m.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly ripped the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook while likening them to copycats, liars, bullies, drug dealers and traitors in an attempt to prove it\u2019s time to crack down on their technology powerhouses.</p><p>The barrage of unflattering comparisons and allegations of misconduct unfolded Wednesday during an extraordinary hearing that summoned Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before a congressional committee. The committee is looking into allegations that the companies have been abusing the popularity of their products and services to stifle competition and innovation.</p><p>All four CEOs appeared via video because of the pandemic.</p><p>Lawmakers were particularly harsh on Google, whose dominant search engine serves as the main gateway to the internet, and Facebook, whose social network with more than 2 billion people has has had trouble blocking efforts to spread bogus information in attempt to sway elections and sow social unrest. Both Pichai and Zuckerberg insisted their companies have worked hard to fix any problems on their services and strive to improve their mostly free services to keep their users happy to they can continue to sell the ads that bring in most of their revenue.</p><p>___</p><p>4:45 p.m.</p><p>A key House lawmaker investigating Big Tech\u2019s power is squarely targeting Amazon.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a hearing Wednesday that evidence shows that the e-commerce giant is only interested in dominating the market and is \u201cfundamentally anti-competitive.\u201d</p><p>Cicilline said \u201cCongress must take action.\u201d</p><p>As chair of a House Judiciary panel, Cicilline is looking toward possible new legislation to update century-old antitrust laws. But Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner rejects the idea that legislation is needed \u2014 showing it could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress.</p><p>The Bezos, along with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook and Google were answering lawmakers' questions about their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the technology industry.</p><p>___</p><p>3:50 p.m.</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he can't guarantee that the company isn't accessing seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives had previously denied.</p><p>His comments came Wednesday during a congressional hearing into the market dominance of four tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been scrutinizing Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d said Bezos, in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Amazon's home state of Washington. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d</p><p>A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted Amazon employees who said they did have access to seller data to make competing products, including a car trunk organizer that Amazon copied.</p><p>Bezos said he was aware of the article and is still looking into the allegations.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not satisfied that we\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of it,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>3:30 p.m.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again being put on the defensive in a congressional hearing over the social network\u2019s role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>And Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, has brought the issue current with concerns that right-wing groups are using Facebook to infiltrate the Black Lives Matter movement and to spread anti-Semitic propaganda.</p><p>Zuckerberg says Facebook uses sophisticated technology to intercept hate speech, often before it\u2019s seen on the platform. \u201cIt hurts our business,\u201d he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg's comments came at hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs are answering for their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.</p><p>___</p><p>2:45 p.m.</p><p>Facebook internal company documents are being deployed against CEO Mark Zuckerberg by lawmakers asserting that the company has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition.</p><p>Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday that documents obtained from the company \u201ctell a very disturbing story\u201d of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.</p><p>He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \u201cmeaningfully hurt\u201d Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \u201ccomplement\u201d to Facebook\u2019s services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsAPP messaging service.</p><p>The questioning came at a congressional hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>___</p><p>2:30 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the power of major technology companies accused Google of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline peppered Google CEO Sundar Pichai with the allegations of abusive behavior while grilling him Wednesday during a hearing that is also putting Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on virtual hot seats while answering questions posed through a video stream.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.</p><p>Pichai struggled to answer one question about whether Google threatened to dump Yelp from its search engine database after the restaurant review site told Google to stop scraping its site for content. Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been updated to correctly identify the CEO of Amazon in the item on unflattering comaparisons. He is Jeff Bezos.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

David Cicilline lodged the accusation at the tech company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Wednesday during a congressional hearing also featuring testimony from the heads of Apple, Amazon and Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cicilline noted a series of popular conspiracy theories - including that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax - that have thrived on Facebook's platform during the deadly virus' grip across the globe.</p><p>\"It brings the most activity which, of course, produces great profit,\" Cicilline said to Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg offered assurances that the social network's users don't want to see misinformation in their feeds, so the company has taken big steps to scrub its site of inaccurate coronavirus claims. But that only invited more push back from Cicilline, noted out that just on Monday the company struggled to take down a video of pro-Trump doctors peddling misleading claims that Americans don't need to wear masks and an unproven anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a sure-fire way to treat the virus.</p><p>The video raked in more than 20 million views before Facebook started removing it, with dozens of other versions of it still cropping up. Earlier in the hourslong hearing, GOP congressmen had complained that Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took down that same video at all, describing it as censorship.</p><p>Nodding to that political tightrope he's walking on, Zuckerberg defended the company's misinformation policies, \"we've been quite aggressive in taking some of that down, as some of the questioning from the other side of the aisle has shown so far.\"</p><p>___</p><p>5:20 p.m.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly ripped the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook while likening them to copycats, liars, bullies, drug dealers and traitors in an attempt to prove it's time to crack down on their technology powerhouses.</p><p>The barrage of unflattering comparisons and allegations of misconduct unfolded Wednesday during an extraordinary hearing that summoned Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before a congressional committee. The committee is looking into allegations that the companies have been abusing the popularity of their products and services to stifle competition and innovation.</p><p>All four CEOs appeared via video because of the pandemic.</p><p>Lawmakers were particularly harsh on Google, whose dominant search engine serves as the main gateway to the internet, and Facebook, whose social network with more than 2 billion people has has had trouble blocking efforts to spread bogus information in attempt to sway elections and sow social unrest. Both Pichai and Zuckerberg insisted their companies have worked hard to fix any problems on their services and strive to improve their mostly free services to keep their users happy to they can continue to sell the ads that bring in most of their revenue.</p><p>___</p><p>4:45 p.m.</p><p>A key House lawmaker investigating Big Tech's power is squarely targeting Amazon.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a hearing Wednesday that evidence shows that the e-commerce giant is only interested in dominating the market and is \"fundamentally anti-competitive.\"</p><p>Cicilline said \"Congress must take action.\"</p><p>As chair of a House Judiciary panel, Cicilline is looking toward possible new legislation to update century-old antitrust laws. But Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner rejects the idea that legislation is needed - showing it could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress.</p><p>The Bezos, along with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook and Google were answering lawmakers' questions about their companies' practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the technology industry.</p><p>___</p><p>3:50 p.m.</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he can't guarantee that the company isn't accessing seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives had previously denied.</p><p>His comments came Wednesday during a congressional hearing into the market dominance of four tech giants - Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been scrutinizing Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" said Bezos, in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Amazon's home state of Washington. \"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"</p><p>A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted Amazon employees who said they did have access to seller data to make competing products, including a car trunk organizer that Amazon copied.</p><p>Bezos said he was aware of the article and is still looking into the allegations.</p><p>\"I'm still not satisfied that we've gotten to the bottom of it,\" he said.</p><p>___</p><p>3:30 p.m.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again being put on the defensive in a congressional hearing over the social network's role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>And Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, has brought the issue current with concerns that right-wing groups are using Facebook to infiltrate the Black Lives Matter movement and to spread anti-Semitic propaganda.</p><p>Zuckerberg says Facebook uses sophisticated technology to intercept hate speech, often before it's seen on the platform. \"It hurts our business,\" he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg's comments came at hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs are answering for their companies' practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.</p><p>___</p><p>2:45 p.m.</p><p>Facebook internal company documents are being deployed against CEO Mark Zuckerberg by lawmakers asserting that the company has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition.</p><p>Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday that documents obtained from the company \"tell a very disturbing story\" of Facebook's acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.</p><p>He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \"meaningfully hurt\" Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \"complement\" to Facebook's services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsAPP messaging service.</p><p>The questioning came at a congressional hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>___</p><p>2:30 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the power of major technology companies accused Google of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline peppered Google CEO Sundar Pichai with the allegations of abusive behaviour while grilling him Wednesday during a hearing that is also putting Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on virtual hot seats while answering questions posed through a video stream.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>Pichai struggled to answer one question about whether Google threatened to dump Yelp from its search engine database after the restaurant review site told Google to stop scraping its site for content. Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been updated to correctly identify the CEO of Amazon in the item on unflattering comaparisons. He is Jeff Bezos.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

(Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP)WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on testimony before a congressional committee by the CEOs of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google (all times local): 6:30 p.m. Democratic chairman of a House antitrust panel says Facebook is making money off dangerous lies that could have deadly consequences. Rep. David Cicilline lodged the accusation at the tech company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Wednesday during a congressional hearing also featuring testimony from the heads of Apple, Amazon and Google. </p><p>Cicilline noted a series of popular conspiracy theories \u2014 including that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax \u2014 that have thrived on Facebook's platform during the deadly virus' grip across the globe.  'It brings the most activity which, of course, produces great profit,' Cicilline said to Zuckerberg.  Zuckerberg offered assurances that the social network's users don't want to see misinformation in their feeds, so the company has taken big steps to scrub its site of inaccurate coronavirus claims. But that only invited more push back from Cicilline, noted out that just on Monday the company struggled to take down a video of pro-Trump doctors peddling misleading claims that Americans don't need to wear masks and an unproven anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a sure-fire way to treat the virus.  The video raked in more than 20 million views before Facebook started removing it, with dozens of other versions of it still cropping up. Earlier in the hourslong hearing, GOP congressmen had complained that Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took down that same video at all, describing it as censorship. Nodding to that political tightrope he's walking on, Zuckerberg defended the company's misinformation policies, 'we've been quite aggressive in taking some of that down, as some of the questioning from the other side of the aisle has shown so far.' (Ad) The last time Bill O'Reilly tried to do something like this, the networks went crazy. But this new O'Reilly message is a lot differentIt's about a single strategy that's being called 'the smartest investment strategy of all-time.'___ 5:20 p.m. U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly ripped the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook while likening them to copycats, liars, bullies, drug dealers and traitors in an attempt to prove it's time to crack down on their technology powerhouses. The barrage of unflattering comparisons and allegations of misconduct unfolded Wednesday during an extraordinary hearing that summoned Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before a congressional committee. The committee is looking into allegations that the companies have been abusing the popularity of their products and services to stifle competition and innovation. All four CEOs appeared via video because of the pandemic. Lawmakers were particularly harsh on Google, whose dominant search engine serves as the main gateway to the internet, and Facebook, whose social network with more than 2 billion people has has had trouble blocking efforts to spread bogus information in attempt to sway elections and sow social unrest. Both Pichai and Zuckerberg insisted their companies have worked hard to fix any problems on their services and strive to improve their mostly free services to keep their users happy to they can continue to sell the ads that bring in most of their revenue. ___ 4:45 p.m. A key House lawmaker investigating Big Tech's power is squarely targeting Amazon.  Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a hearing Wednesday that evidence shows that the e-commerce giant is only interested in dominating the market and is 'fundamentally anti-competitive.'  Cicilline said 'Congress must take action.'  As chair of a House Judiciary panel, Cicilline is looking toward possible new legislation to update century-old antitrust laws. But Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner rejects the idea that legislation is needed \u2014 showing it could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress. The Bezos, along with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook and Google were answering lawmakers' questions about their companies' practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the technology industry. ___ 3:50 p.m. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he can't guarantee that the company isn't accessing seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives had previously denied.  His comments came Wednesday during a congressional hearing into the market dominance of four tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been scrutinizing Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.  'We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,' said Bezos, in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Amazon's home state of Washington. 'But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.' A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted Amazon employees who said they did have access to seller data to make competing products, including a car trunk organizer that Amazon copied.  Bezos said he was aware of the article and is still looking into the allegations. 'I'm still not satisfied that we've gotten to the bottom of it,' he said. ___ 3:30 p.m. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again being put on the defensive in a congressional hearing over the social network's role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  And Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, has brought the issue current with concerns that right-wing groups are using Facebook to infiltrate the Black Lives Matter movement and to spread anti-Semitic propaganda. Zuckerberg says Facebook uses sophisticated technology to intercept hate speech, often before it's seen on the platform. 'It hurts our business,' he said. Zuckerberg's comments came at hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs are answering for their companies' practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry. ___ 2:45 p.m. Facebook internal company documents are being deployed against CEO Mark Zuckerberg by lawmakers asserting that the company has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday that documents obtained from the company 'tell a very disturbing story' of Facebook's acquisition of the Instagram messaging service. He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could 'meaningfully hurt' Facebook. Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a 'complement' to Facebook's services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsAPP messaging service. The questioning came at a congressional hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. ___ 2:30 p.m. The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the power of major technology companies accused Google of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits. Rep. David Cicilline peppered Google CEO Sundar Pichai with the allegations of abusive behavior while grilling him Wednesday during a hearing that is also putting Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on virtual hot seats while answering questions posed through a video stream. Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing. Pichai struggled to answer one question about whether Google threatened to dump Yelp from its search engine database after the restaurant review site told Google to stop scraping its site for content. Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015. ___ This story has been updated to correctly identify the CEO of Amazon in the item on unflattering comaparisons. He is Jeff Bezos. Companies Mentioned in This Article 7 Stocks to Buy Before the Economy Reopens[1]Anyone who pretends they know when the economy will reopen is not telling you the truth. And more importantly, what reopening the economy is going to look like is anybody's guess. For certain we're not going to be seeing anything that resembles business as usual. And more likely than not, this will not be the 'V-shaped' recovery that some analysts are predicting. Restaurants may be open, but seating capacity is likely to be limited as social distancing will remain the custom. Live sports may return, but it's not unreasonable to expect that games will be played without fans, or at least with very few fans in attendance. And there are other considerations as well. Workers will be allowed to go back to work, but after discovering the time value of working from home will they want to. And maybe equally as important, will employers want them to come into the office? These are fascinating scenarios that will define the post-virus, pre-vaccine economy. But as an investor, you know that there are stocks you can buy right now that will be ready to flourish when the economy reopens. On this list, we're not looking at theme parks or airlines. They will come around, but slowly. Instead, we've picked seven stocks in different sectors that stand to benefit as the economy finds its new normal.

David Cicilline lodged the accusation at the tech company\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Wednesday during a congressional hearing also featuring testimony from the heads of Apple, Amazon and Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cicilline noted a series of popular conspiracy theories \u2014 including that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax \u2014 that have thrived on Facebook's platform during the deadly virus\u2019 grip across the globe.</p><p>\u201cIt brings the most activity which, of course, produces great profit,\u201d Cicilline said to Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg offered assurances that the social network's users don\u2019t want to see misinformation in their feeds, so the company has taken big steps to scrub its site of inaccurate coronavirus claims. But that only invited more push back from Cicilline, noted out that just on Monday the company struggled to take down a video of pro-Trump doctors peddling misleading claims that Americans don\u2019t need to wear masks and an unproven anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a sure-fire way to treat the virus.</p><p>The video raked in more than 20 million views before Facebook started removing it, with dozens of other versions of it still cropping up. Earlier in the hourslong hearing, GOP congressmen had complained that Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took down that same video at all, describing it as censorship.</p><p>Nodding to that political tightrope he\u2019s walking on, Zuckerberg defended the company\u2019s misinformation policies, \u201cwe\u2019ve been quite aggressive in taking some of that down, as some of the questioning from the other side of the aisle has shown so far.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>5:20 p.m.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly ripped the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook while likening them to copycats, liars, bullies, drug dealers and traitors in an attempt to prove it\u2019s time to crack down on their technology powerhouses.</p><p>The barrage of unflattering comparisons and allegations of misconduct unfolded Wednesday during an extraordinary hearing that summoned Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before a congressional committee. The committee is looking into allegations that the companies have been abusing the popularity of their products and services to stifle competition and innovation.</p><p>All four CEOs appeared via video because of the pandemic.</p><p>Lawmakers were particularly harsh on Google, whose dominant search engine serves as the main gateway to the internet, and Facebook, whose social network with more than 2 billion people has has had trouble blocking efforts to spread bogus information in attempt to sway elections and sow social unrest. Both Pichai and Zuckerberg insisted their companies have worked hard to fix any problems on their services and strive to improve their mostly free services to keep their users happy to they can continue to sell the ads that bring in most of their revenue.</p><p>___</p><p>4:45 p.m.</p><p>A key House lawmaker investigating Big Tech\u2019s power is squarely targeting Amazon.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a hearing Wednesday that evidence shows that the e-commerce giant is only interested in dominating the market and is \u201cfundamentally anti-competitive.\u201d</p><p>Cicilline said \u201cCongress must take action.\u201d</p><p>As chair of a House Judiciary panel, Cicilline is looking toward possible new legislation to update century-old antitrust laws. But Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner rejects the idea that legislation is needed \u2014 showing it could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress.</p><p>The Bezos, along with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook and Google were answering lawmakers' questions about their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the technology industry.</p><p>___</p><p>3:50 p.m.</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he can't guarantee that the company isn't accessing seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives had previously denied.</p><p>His comments came Wednesday during a congressional hearing into the market dominance of four tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been scrutinizing Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d said Bezos, in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Amazon's home state of Washington. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d</p><p>A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted Amazon employees who said they did have access to seller data to make competing products, including a car trunk organizer that Amazon copied.</p><p>Bezos said he was aware of the article and is still looking into the allegations.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not satisfied that we\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of it,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>3:30 p.m.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again being put on the defensive in a congressional hearing over the social network\u2019s role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>And Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, has brought the issue current with concerns that right-wing groups are using Facebook to infiltrate the Black Lives Matter movement and to spread anti-Semitic propaganda.</p><p>Zuckerberg says Facebook uses sophisticated technology to intercept hate speech, often before it\u2019s seen on the platform. \u201cIt hurts our business,\u201d he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg's comments came at hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs are answering for their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.</p><p>___</p><p>2:45 p.m.</p><p>Facebook internal company documents are being deployed against CEO Mark Zuckerberg by lawmakers asserting that the company has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition.</p><p>Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday that documents obtained from the company \u201ctell a very disturbing story\u201d of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.</p><p>He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \u201cmeaningfully hurt\u201d Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \u201ccomplement\u201d to Facebook\u2019s services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsAPP messaging service.</p><p>The questioning came at a congressional hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>___</p><p>2:30 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the power of major technology companies accused Google of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline peppered Google CEO Sundar Pichai with the allegations of abusive behavior while grilling him Wednesday during a hearing that is also putting Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on virtual hot seats while answering questions posed through a video stream.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.</p><p>Pichai struggled to answer one question about whether Google threatened to dump Yelp from its search engine database after the restaurant review site told Google to stop scraping its site for content. Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been updated to correctly identify the CEO of Amazon in the item on unflattering comaparisons. He is Jeff Bezos.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

David Cicilline lodged the accusation at the tech company\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Wednesday during a congressional hearing also featuring testimony from the heads of Apple, Amazon and Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cicilline noted a series of popular conspiracy theories \u2014 including that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax \u2014 that have thrived on Facebook's platform during the deadly virus\u2019 grip across the globe.</p><p>\u201cIt brings the most activity which, of course, produces great profit,\u201d Cicilline said to Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg offered assurances that the social network's users don\u2019t want to see misinformation in their feeds, so the company has taken big steps to scrub its site of inaccurate coronavirus claims. But that only invited more push back from Cicilline, noted out that just on Monday the company struggled to take down a video of pro-Trump doctors peddling misleading claims that Americans don\u2019t need to wear masks and an unproven anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a sure-fire way to treat the virus.</p><p>The video raked in more than 20 million views before Facebook started removing it, with dozens of other versions of it still cropping up. Earlier in the hourslong hearing, GOP congressmen had complained that Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took down that same video at all, describing it as censorship.</p><p>Nodding to that political tightrope he\u2019s walking on, Zuckerberg defended the company\u2019s misinformation policies, \u201cwe\u2019ve been quite aggressive in taking some of that down, as some of the questioning from the other side of the aisle has shown so far.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>5:20 p.m.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly ripped the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook while likening them to copycats, liars, bullies, drug dealers and traitors in an attempt to prove it\u2019s time to crack down on their technology powerhouses.</p><p>The barrage of unflattering comparisons and allegations of misconduct unfolded Wednesday during an extraordinary hearing that summoned Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before a congressional committee. The committee is looking into allegations that the companies have been abusing the popularity of their products and services to stifle competition and innovation.</p><p>All four CEOs appeared via video because of the pandemic.</p><p>Lawmakers were particularly harsh on Google, whose dominant search engine serves as the main gateway to the internet, and Facebook, whose social network with more than 2 billion people has has had trouble blocking efforts to spread bogus information in attempt to sway elections and sow social unrest. Both Pichai and Zuckerberg insisted their companies have worked hard to fix any problems on their services and strive to improve their mostly free services to keep their users happy to they can continue to sell the ads that bring in most of their revenue.</p><p>___</p><p>4:45 p.m.</p><p>A key House lawmaker investigating Big Tech\u2019s power is squarely targeting Amazon.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a hearing Wednesday that evidence shows that the e-commerce giant is only interested in dominating the market and is \u201cfundamentally anti-competitive.\u201d</p><p>Cicilline said \u201cCongress must take action.\u201d</p><p>As chair of a House Judiciary panel, Cicilline is looking toward possible new legislation to update century-old antitrust laws. But Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner rejects the idea that legislation is needed \u2014 showing it could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress.</p><p>The Bezos, along with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook and Google were answering lawmakers' questions about their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the technology industry.</p><p>___</p><p>3:50 p.m.</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he can't guarantee that the company isn't accessing seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives had previously denied.</p><p>His comments came Wednesday during a congressional hearing into the market dominance of four tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been scrutinizing Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d said Bezos, in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Amazon's home state of Washington. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d</p><p>A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted Amazon employees who said they did have access to seller data to make competing products, including a car trunk organizer that Amazon copied.</p><p>Bezos said he was aware of the article and is still looking into the allegations.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not satisfied that we\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of it,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>3:30 p.m.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again being put on the defensive in a congressional hearing over the social network\u2019s role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>And Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, has brought the issue current with concerns that right-wing groups are using Facebook to infiltrate the Black Lives Matter movement and to spread anti-Semitic propaganda.</p><p>Zuckerberg says Facebook uses sophisticated technology to intercept hate speech, often before it\u2019s seen on the platform. \u201cIt hurts our business,\u201d he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg's comments came at hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs are answering for their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.</p><p>___</p><p>2:45 p.m.</p><p>Facebook internal company documents are being deployed against CEO Mark Zuckerberg by lawmakers asserting that the company has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition.</p><p>Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday that documents obtained from the company \u201ctell a very disturbing story\u201d of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.</p><p>He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \u201cmeaningfully hurt\u201d Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \u201ccomplement\u201d to Facebook\u2019s services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsAPP messaging service.</p><p>The questioning came at a congressional hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>___</p><p>2:30 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the power of major technology companies accused Google of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline peppered Google CEO Sundar Pichai with the allegations of abusive behavior while grilling him Wednesday during a hearing that is also putting Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on virtual hot seats while answering questions posed through a video stream.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.</p><p>Pichai struggled to answer one question about whether Google threatened to dump Yelp from its search engine database after the restaurant review site told Google to stop scraping its site for content. Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been updated to correctly identify the CEO of Amazon in the item on unflattering comaparisons. He is Jeff Bezos.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

David Cicilline lodged the accusation at the tech company\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Wednesday during a congressional hearing also featuring testimony from the heads of Apple, Amazon and Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cicilline noted a series of popular conspiracy theories \u2014 including that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax \u2014 that have thrived on Facebook's platform during the deadly virus\u2019 grip across the globe.</p><p>\u201cIt brings the most activity which, of course, produces great profit,\u201d Cicilline said to Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg offered assurances that the social network's users don\u2019t want to see misinformation in their feeds, so the company has taken big steps to scrub its site of inaccurate coronavirus claims. But that only invited more push back from Cicilline, noted out that just on Monday the company struggled to take down a video of pro-Trump doctors peddling misleading claims that Americans don\u2019t need to wear masks and an unproven anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a sure-fire way to treat the virus.</p><p>The video raked in more than 20 million views before Facebook started removing it, with dozens of other versions of it still cropping up. Earlier in the hourslong hearing, GOP congressmen had complained that Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took down that same video at all, describing it as censorship.</p><p>Nodding to that political tightrope he\u2019s walking on, Zuckerberg defended the company\u2019s misinformation policies, \u201cwe\u2019ve been quite aggressive in taking some of that down, as some of the questioning from the other side of the aisle has shown so far.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>5:20 p.m.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly ripped the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook while likening them to copycats, liars, bullies, drug dealers and traitors in an attempt to prove it\u2019s time to crack down on their technology powerhouses.</p><p>The barrage of unflattering comparisons and allegations of misconduct unfolded Wednesday during an extraordinary hearing that summoned Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before a congressional committee. The committee is looking into allegations that the companies have been abusing the popularity of their products and services to stifle competition and innovation.</p><p>All four CEOs appeared via video because of the pandemic.</p><p>Lawmakers were particularly harsh on Google, whose dominant search engine serves as the main gateway to the internet, and Facebook, whose social network with more than 2 billion people has has had trouble blocking efforts to spread bogus information in attempt to sway elections and sow social unrest. Both Pichai and Zuckerberg insisted their companies have worked hard to fix any problems on their services and strive to improve their mostly free services to keep their users happy to they can continue to sell the ads that bring in most of their revenue.</p><p>___</p><p>4:45 p.m.</p><p>A key House lawmaker investigating Big Tech\u2019s power is squarely targeting Amazon.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a hearing Wednesday that evidence shows that the e-commerce giant is only interested in dominating the market and is \u201cfundamentally anti-competitive.\u201d</p><p>Cicilline said \u201cCongress must take action.\u201d</p><p>As chair of a House Judiciary panel, Cicilline is looking toward possible new legislation to update century-old antitrust laws. But Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner rejects the idea that legislation is needed \u2014 showing it could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress.</p><p>The Bezos, along with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook and Google were answering lawmakers' questions about their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the technology industry.</p><p>___</p><p>3:50 p.m.</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he can't guarantee that the company isn't accessing seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives had previously denied.</p><p>His comments came Wednesday during a congressional hearing into the market dominance of four tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been scrutinizing Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d said Bezos, in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Amazon's home state of Washington. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d</p><p>A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted Amazon employees who said they did have access to seller data to make competing products, including a car trunk organizer that Amazon copied.</p><p>Bezos said he was aware of the article and is still looking into the allegations.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not satisfied that we\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of it,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>3:30 p.m.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again being put on the defensive in a congressional hearing over the social network\u2019s role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>And Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, has brought the issue current with concerns that right-wing groups are using Facebook to infiltrate the Black Lives Matter movement and to spread anti-Semitic propaganda.</p><p>Zuckerberg says Facebook uses sophisticated technology to intercept hate speech, often before it\u2019s seen on the platform. \u201cIt hurts our business,\u201d he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg's comments came at hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs are answering for their companies\u2019 practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.</p><p>___</p><p>2:45 p.m.</p><p>Facebook internal company documents are being deployed against CEO Mark Zuckerberg by lawmakers asserting that the company has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition.</p><p>Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday that documents obtained from the company \u201ctell a very disturbing story\u201d of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.</p><p>He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \u201cmeaningfully hurt\u201d Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \u201ccomplement\u201d to Facebook\u2019s services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsAPP messaging service.</p><p>The questioning came at a congressional hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>___</p><p>2:30 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the power of major technology companies accused Google of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline peppered Google CEO Sundar Pichai with the allegations of abusive behavior while grilling him Wednesday during a hearing that is also putting Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on virtual hot seats while answering questions posed through a video stream.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.</p><p>Pichai struggled to answer one question about whether Google threatened to dump Yelp from its search engine database after the restaurant review site told Google to stop scraping its site for content. Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been updated to correctly identify the CEO of Amazon in the item on unflattering comaparisons. He is Jeff Bezos.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Over the course of the past few weeks, all the main political parties have had something to say about the high cost of cellphone prices in Canada and the prospect of implementing new taxes on tech companies. Laura Tribe, the Executive Director of OpenMedia[1], joined the podcast[2] to talk about election 2019 and digital policies in a conversation that focused on wireless services and Internet taxes as well as privacy, intermediary liability, trade, and copyright.

Justin Trudeau: Canadians shouldn't have to choose between having a cell phone and heating their homes. So we need to get to a place where the cost of cell service is more affordable. That's why a re-elected Liberal government will cut cell phone bills by 25 percent, saving the average Canadian family of four up to nine hundred seventy six dollars a year. Andrew Scheer: We believe in in ensuring that robust competition in Canada is that we believe that robust competition is the best way to make sure that Canadians have affordable services. Jagmeet Singh: This is one of the most frustrating things that Canadians go through. We pay the highest amount for our data, for our cell phone bills and for our broadband broadband in the world. This is incredibly frustrating when so many people rely on this. This is something that is necessary for work, for school. This is necessary for accessing services for so many people. So what we're gonna do is finally take on this very important role that conservative liberal government have essentially neglected. They haven't taken on making sure these rates are affordable. So our plan is going to make rates more affordable. It's going to make your cellphone bills more affordable. Elizabeth May: We're going to deal with the problem of e-commerce. These companies that first came to us that seemed virtual and cool, and how could they be damaging? Not only are these companies, whether they're Facebook or Google or Amazon or Airbnb or Netflix, they operate in this country, take billions of dollars of profits out of this country, pay virtually no tax. Michael Geist: Digital issues were expected to garner attention in the 2019 Canadian federal election campaign. As the clips that opened this episode suggest, all the main political parties have had something to say about some policies, notably the high cost of cell phone prices in Canada and the prospect of implementing new taxes on tech companies. With this episode scheduled to be released less than a week before voting day, I sat down with Laura Tribe, the executive director of OpenMedia, to talk about election 2019 and digital policies. The conversation focused on wireless services and Internet taxes, but we also found time to discuss privacy, intermediary liability, trade and copyright. Note that the episode was recorded in the afternoon on Thursday, October 10th. The Conservative Party had still not released its full platform, so to the extent possible, we relied instead on comments made throughout the campaign. Michael Geist: Laura, thanks so much for joining me on the podcast. Laura Tribe: Thanks for having me. Michael Geist: OK, that's great. So as you know, we both know digital issues were expected to play a significant role in the 2019 federal election. And as we record this on Thursday, October 10th, we're eleven days from voting day. I think it's fair to say that the reality is, has that been a bit more hit and miss. Students on our campus here at the University of Ottawa have been able to vote for several days already. Advance voting starts tomorrow for everyone else. In fact, we still don't even have a Conservative platform as we record this. So digital on its own may not have been a huge issue, but it does crop up in a few places. You can see it in the different platforms and even come up in a couple in a little bit in some of the debates, or at least the French language debate around things like affordability and wireless services, cultural policy and economic fairness. So I'm hoping that we can unpack some of those issues, recognizing that we've got platforms for everybody but the conservatives. But if you haven't put something forward 11 days before the election, we'll go with what we've got. Why don't we start with wireless Internet services, which is of all the issues, certainly is probably attracted the most amount of attention largely through the prism of affordability. What are the parties that are saying something saying about the cost of Internet and wireless services? Laura Tribe: Yeah, I would say this is definitely the issue that's gotten the most attention. For the longest portion of the election period to date, so far, we've heard things from the Liberals, the NDP and the Green Party who are all talking about affordability in their own right. The Green Party hasn't put forward any really specific policies. It's just that they want to address affordability and cell phone bills and increase competition. The two policies that have gotten the most attention are the Liberals and the NDP. The NDP who came out with their plan first is looking specifically at lowering cell phone rates for customers by an average of $10 per person. So they want to do that through rate regulation. That will actually require the providers to lower their prices and make sure that depending on the type of plan, it could come down $7 and $12. But across the board, it would be an average of $10 per person. And they're also looking at introducing mobile virtual network operators or mvno's, which are a different type of cell phone provider that will bring a bit more competition into the marketplace. The Liberals following suit promised 25 percent off cell phone rates, which, you know, depending on your plan is probably more than $10. But the way they're going to do it has really been the thing that they've been slammed for. And essentially what they've said is they're going to ask big telecom nicely to lower their rates by 25 percent. Laura Tribe: And I think that's really something that they've been slammed for and deservingly so. They've been in government for four years. We've been asking nicely at open media and elsewhere for them to lower their rates for a very long time. And we've clearly seen that that's just not going to happen. So that's sort of the first piece around how they will lower rates. They're sort of follow up threat if rates are not lowered is that they are going to also bring in mvno's to try and lower cell phone rates and bring in more competition. But they've introduced it in a bit of a phased approach. So what they're saying is they will bring them in to some extent if they meet certain criteria. Whatever those qualifications might be that the liberals have decided that include things like the infrastructure and the types of plans that they're offering and a few other pieces, sort of the values they represent, which I think is problematic in that it's hard for a company to necessarily match a political party's values in the same way. But that's sort of a really minimum entry. And they said that if in two years the cell phone prices have not come down by 25 percent, then they will look at fully mandating mvno's. And so those are sort of the two biggest platforms. We've heard nothing from the Conservative Party other than I think in one article when they were asked. They said they would consider tax rebates with no indication as to what that meant or looked like or how that would work. Laura Tribe: But I think that fundamentally when it comes to cell phone affordability. It's really good this is an issue and I will be the first to criticize the policies they're putting into place to try and do it, but it's something that people have been talking about for decades and it's really good to see that it's on the agenda. I think the problem is that the way the parties are trying to do it and in part it's just because it's an election cycle and they're trying to make sure they can get to voters is by promising the end piece, which is how it will impact your cell phone bill. And really forgetting why our cell phone bills are so high in the first place, which is fundamentally because we do not have enough competition in Canada. And so, you know, the NDP understands there will need to be some government intervention, which is good. They're talking about mvno's, which is good. But there is a proceeding in front of the CRTC right now that's reviewing all of our wireless services and trying to figure out if we do need mvno's. And I think it's in all cases really great to see that ? registered, but also raises some questions about if they actually understand why this is the case and how to fix it or if they just think it sounds like a nice promise. Michael Geist: Right. So, I mean, I agree with you. I think it is good that the issue clearly resonates. And I know that there's been a number of political commentators have said this is one of the issues of all these issues the parties have been raising that they can see it resonating in part because people can really relate to high cell phone bills. There's there there's very little debate anymore as to whether or not we pay very high rates relative to other countries. And so promises to do something about it would intuitively seem attractive. I guess the question becomes, is any of this going to work? So let me ask you a couple of specific questions on the. From the NDP perspective, the rate regulation side, have they talked at all about how that would work, how if they were if we were to have government come in and effectively set rates or set maximum rates or set with the mandated reduction in the rate happens to be? It's not clear. Have they specified how they would intend to go about doing that? Laura Tribe: There haven't been a lot of details into how they would do it. I know they've been trying to demonstrate other countries that have had mvno's mandated and trying to point to those as examples. Not so much in saying they would do it exactly the same way, but to try and say we know that intervention and regulation on mvno's can work. I think the question in the way that they are approaching mvno's and the way that they're approaching affordability in general is that they're coming at it from the end retail price. And fundamentally, mvno's are about competition. They're about bringing more providers in, hopefully lowering the rates themselves. And so I think, you know, getting really deep into the policy weeds of telecom, there's two layers to that. Mvno's need wholesale rates to be set, which are then indicative of what the retail rates can be set at. And so it sounds like the NDP is working in reverse. They're actually saying, here's it, we want the retail rates to be set at. And there's an assumption that is not from what the NDP has said, but just in understanding how telecom works, that they will then have to work backwards and say, if we're going to bring all the retail rates down by 10 percent, then any rates that are for roaming or wholesale will need to therefore be X percent lower to make sure that we can't increase competition. It's a pretty complicated approach to fix all those layers. It would definitely require the CRTC to be involved, although that hasn't sort of how that would work together hasn't explicitly come out from the NDP. A lot of it's trying to apply what I know and we know about how telecom policy actually works in Canada to the promises that are being put forward and trying to reverse engineer how it would actually play out. Michael Geist: Right. Okay. So the NDP promise focusing on prices faces some real implementation challenges. The Liberals have both this notion of we can cajole or talk or talk to her, convince the the incumbents to lower their prices. And I think you've made it pretty clear, as most would, that that historically hasn't didn't seem to work. And there's little reason to think that that it would work now. So it sounds like a lot of this talk is being placed in mvno's as the source of competition. But it sounds as well that with respect to the liberal plan, even that isn't an immediate solution. It's kind of like will dip our toe in the water. And if it works, great. And if not, we'll do more that kind of what they're saying. Laura Tribe: Yeah, I think that the Liberals have set the bar for something that is probably going to be achieved with or without them. So their election promises that they can check off when it comes to prices coming down by 25 percent. If you look at your cell bill right now and I think you're just going to get a 25 percent discount when the Liberals get voted in, I think you're wrong. But what we do know is that the data that we have right now is so far behind in Canada that there are some that believe and I do not have the evidence to prove this, but there are some that believe that the prices have already come down enough that the liberals will be able to say that they did it just by virtue of when the data is published next. So that's a, you know, bar they can say that they reached. And when it comes to mvno's with the CRTC already looking at MVNO is already having them on the table. Essentially what the liberals have promised is the minimum viable product out of that consultation. Which again, doesn't require them to do anything. It's just predicting the writing on the wall from the CRTC, whose own consultation and then saying in two years if nothing has happened on those two fronts. Then they will take action, which to me reads like they're not going to touch telecom for two years, which is why it's pretty frustrating as someone who's been working on this for so long to hear them say that we have to keep waiting. Michael Geist: And it's a bit surprising, I think, from a liberal perspective, because it's not as if they haven't done anything on telecom or at least tried to do something on telecom. When we think of the policy direction or the requirement that CRTC re-examine some of these issues, you're talking about MVNO's. The Liberals have tried to push for that. So one would have thought they might have been able to say we've been pushing and trying to move in this direction. Here's what we're gonna continue to do. They seem to have sort of almost ignored much of what they've done in the past in favour of, as you're suggesting, policy recommendations that they don't really have to do very much about. Laura Tribe: Yeah, I think the the policy direction that now requires the CRTC to take things like customers into consideration, which is not the case before, to make sure that affordability is a consideration that they're looking at for smaller providers like those are really big shifts that we haven't had a chance to see if and how they truly play out at the CRTC. So there is a really good chance that by virtue of that policy direction, the CRTC is on decision on wireless actually is much better for customers, for smaller providers by virtue of following the policy direction. And there are a lot of pieces that have been put into play, but fundamentally this government's approach to the CRTC has been like we will keep asking them and hope they get it right. So they have sent the decision on mvno's back to the CRTC and then when they didn't get a right kind of like, okay, next tactic and keep sending messages to this year ATC. And I think fundamentally what this platform shows me is that they are unwilling to just own it as a file, that they want to make sure that they are continuing to leave that to the CRTC to solve. And I think that it's going to take a while to see if the policy direction actually works and where those decisions come to you. But the CRTC is not a fast moving institution. Their decisions understandably take a really long time and we're not going to see change overnight no matter what the decision is that comes out of the CRTC is wireless proceeding. Michael Geist: Well, I mean, as you say, it's good that the issue is is now risen to the level being a true political issue, but I suppose a little discouraging in the sense of some of the solutions that are being proposed because it doesn't seem like they're advancing things all that much. One of the other issues that has also attracted some amount of attention, although I think with a fair in a fairly confusing way, is what's often described as a Netflix tax, which often is said to mean different things. In fact, just this week as we're recording it, there was, I think, more confusion, where the OECD, advanced the ball a little bit in terms of dealing with corporate tax. And I noted at least one article that said that had at least a couple of political parties saying, well, we want to go further than the OECD. But what they were talking about was not necessarily what the OECD was dealing with to begin with, which is part of the challenge where there's a catch all term and it's taken to mean any number of different things. So can you tell us a bit about what are the parties have had to say generally about either a Netflix tax or perhaps even more broadly? We can unpack it that way. Taxation, digital services and I guess Canadian content gets thrown in there as well. Laura Tribe: If we could put the definitions of a Netflix tax and Internet tax, sales tax, all of the taxes to rest once and for all, it would be beautiful. But I think the Netflix tax is a catch all phrase that came up in the last election with Stephen Harper, which is fundamentally a tax on over-the-top streaming services like Netflix that would have to pay and to fund Canadian content in the same way that cable providers do. Now, in the last election, it was very clear that was off the table over the entire course of the Liberals last four years. Everything we've heard out of Canadian heritage was that everything's on the table except a Netflix tax that was always the one thing that was off the table. And we're seeing it start to creep up again in this election. But over the past four years, taxing things like Netflix to make sure that they're paying into Canadian content has always been off the table. Other things that we have seen coming up since that all get looped into that Netflix tax bucket are things like an Internet tax or an ISP levy that would require all Internet service providers to pay into Canadian content the same way that cable providers do with the idea that people are cutting the cord and using the Internet. So therefore they must be using the internet to stream content and we must make them pay into Canadian content. That's something that fundamentally OpenMedia does not support. We already pay some of the highest prices in the world for Internet, which is why we're talking about cell phone prices, why we talk of Internet prices. And there is no question those fees would be passed on to customers. Laura Tribe: It also implies that the Internet only has one purpose, which is for streaming Netflix, which is not the case. It would require businesses who have servers to be paying into Canadian content by virtue of trying to host data for their own companies. There's a ton of examples as to why it doesn't work. We also have sales tax, which somehow never gets put into the conversation, even though it's the most obvious solution for a lot of these. And that's really around companies like Netflix, Amazon, International companies that operate in Canada with services that are not charging their customers GST or HST and therefore not remitting it to the government. That one is mostly not the case because it's just been hard for governments to figure out how to enforce it, but there's nothing fundamentally stopping them from doing it. And it does look like in this election the Liberals have put that back on the table. So it does look like sales tax will be in consideration. Laura Tribe: And then we also have the new tax that the Liberals declared around online advertising, which is a 3 percent tax on all of the major online advertisers. I don't remember what the billions of dollars they have to make ad revenues to qualify for, but that would be an additional 3 percent tax. And depending on how you read the comments from the Liberals and the NDP and the Green Party, there's a really good Q...ith them on big tech in the Toronto Star. Reading through their own platforms, they are all consistently vague and ambiguous on them, but it looks like the Netflix tax is very much back on the table to require everyone to pay into the Canadian content system, as well as requiring companies like Netflix, like YouTube in some cases, depending on how you read it, to actually produce the same amount of Canadian content that cable providers are as well. And so, you know, there's we can get into as deep as you want any one of them. But fundamentally, the policies that seem to be on the table right now have taken us back to an era before the 2015 election and actually seem to be taking us back into an era of cable TV where instead of being able to look at what the Internet looks like now and how we want the world to look, instead of having these sort of forward looking, innovative policies, we're just stuck and going back to how do we make it look more like the thing that we're used to on TV because we don't know what to do with us. So it's pretty discouraging. Michael Geist: Fair enough. So just to make sure because, you know. Outlining the various tax proposals that are out there, but I take it on the sales tax issue. So applying it to foreign services that don't have a presence here, of course, if when we're talking about sales taxes are not paying sales tax themselves or merely collecting or collecting and remitting on behalf of their customers. That sounds like that's on the table really for all the parties that have a platform at this point in time, they're all willing to say we need a level playing field with respect to sales tax. Yeah. Okay. So we've got that on the. Laura Tribe: Haven't heard anything from the Conservatives or. I haven't heard anything from the Conservatives. I know definitely from the Liberals and it's been implied from the other party. Michael Geist: Fair enough. I think actually Scheer may have, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer may have provided some indication that they're willing to look at this as well. But you're right, as we record this, we still don't have a platform, so we don't know what if that's the case or what it looks like. And in a sense, it's a good illustration of why it becomes a problem, because these issues become take on different mean different things to different people. It's really helpful to get a clearer articulation to extend to which we get a clearer articulation of where things stand. So say it sounds like digital sales taxes are on the way pretty much regardless least of the parties that have put that forward. Yeah, the corporate tax, it sounds like the various parties are also at least entertain the possibility of saying we want to find ways to ensure that large international technology companies who have the ability to move dollars around more easily perhaps than others, that they pay some amount of essentially corporate income tax in Canada. By way of some sort of levy or something like that, although back I guess could be worked on internationally first. Or maybe Canada just jumps in and says, this is what we want until there's an international solution. Laura Tribe: It sounds like all of the parties are on board for following the international solution and trying to figure out how to go further. But that's about the level of detail you've been given. And getting into more specifics, I'd be trying to guess. Michael Geist: Yeah, no, that's and then that's fair in this part of the problem. Is it. Yeah. You know, there's there's there's votes to be had at least the parties seem to think there is by saying that you're going to prepared to take on Big Tech so to speak. But the specifics sometimes are missing. It's that last one that becomes I think really relevant, this issue of whether or not there are mandated contributions, which was, I think the original thinking behind what a Netflix tax to Stephen Harper did that somewhat cheesy video about no Netflix taxes and how he was a fan of Breaking Bad. So it sounds like the parties have shift in that regard. So, for example, the current government, a Liberal government, Pablo Rodriguez previously and he's been his predecessor, Melanie Joly seemed to be hedge a little bit when it came to these issues. Take it, Mr. Rodriguez and the party itself have kind of jumped in more aggressively about the prospect of mandated payments. Laura Tribe: Yeah, it looks like the line of if you're benefiting, you have to pay, I think which you've dealt with previously and talk much about seems to be their underlying principle. And there's ways to pick that apart for a whole other podcasts. But it looks like there there are multiple layers of how they're trying to go about it. So they want financial contributions into the Canadian Media Fund to be coming from international over the top providers, which could include not just Netflix, but Amazon Prime, Disney plus if it comes to Canada and as it comes to Canada to paying into the system. But then there's a second layer, which is also to require them to provide the same amount of Canadian content that TV providers are actually required to have, which I think raises a lot of questions around what would a Disney plus rollout in Canada look like when Disney doesn't have a very large Cancon catalog? And what does Cancon mean? And I think that's the piece that has really been missing in the conversation when we're talking about Canadian content and then looking at something like YouTube, where there is a ton of content that's on there by people in Canada who are Canadian made in and about Canada. But because they don't meet sort of the industry's qualifications of Cancon wouldn't count. And so I think there's a lot of questions around not just what does it mean to have them hosted, but if you're Netflix and all of a sudden, you know, there's been a lot of criticism about Netflix deal with Melanie Joly and how they said they would invest more in Canada. And it was a four year deal and they've already done it in two and they're proud of how much they're investing in Canada. But does it count as Canadian content? And if you're Netflix and let's say that 10 percent of your catalog is Canadian, but you have to hit 30 percent. Are you gonna go make 20 percent new Canadian content or are you going to drop part of your catalog that's available to Canada? And so I think there's a lot of questions around what that actually does to our access to content in Canada by making those contributions and really fundamentally threatens the idea of what it means to have an open Internet. When you're mandating what people need to be providing and obligations of content being put online. Michael Geist: Right. So it really does get into that Internet regulation writ large when it's early if you start getting into what you're required to do. And I know that there's been talk certainly of requiring promoting of Canadian content, perhaps having a certain amount of Canadian content as well as, of course, funding that Canadian content. What is all of this say with respect to the government's broadcast and telecommunications legislative review panel? Because these are the kinds of issues that the government had, depending on your perspective, either punted or at least wanted to ensure got a fulsome review by an expert panel that struck this panel. We've now had at least an interim report from the panel. But it sure feels like at least when it comes to liberals and I suppose with all the parties that have at least put forward platforms, that they're in a sense not even looking to wait to hear what this panel has to say, they've already decided what they want to see done. Laura Tribe: Yeah, it's really frustrating. Minister Rodriguez comments in June when the butyl our panel put out their interim report was a real shot at the people who participated as an organization that funneled thousands of people's comments into this and, you know, as an act of good faith took the government at its word to say, we want to let the experts think about it and we want a fulsome review to have halfway through the minister, who is in charge of half of this project say that's great, we can't wait to do this thing. We've already decided. So looking forward to your final report. It felt like a slap in the face. I think. All of the parties that have comment on this obviously have a position on what they want to see come out of the report. If any changes are made, the ones who actually seem to have the strongest view are the liberals who actually implemented the overhaul and the review itself, which seems the most confusing because they're the ones who said we want to wait and see. And now they're the ones who seem to have a vision predetermined. But fundamentally, even when the report is done and it's due at the end of January, that will take into consideration recommendations for everything that needs be changed on broadcasting and telecommunications. That's just the start. That's just really the recommendations. And in the same way you got recommendations from committees back to government, it's really up to the government of the day to decide what to do with it. And so as frustrating as it is to have political parties trying to predetermine an outcome, it is an election. And it does mean that at least we know who we're voting on, who's going to be picking up this ball when when it comes to them. But it looks like regardless of where you stand, people have decided this is something they need to have a really strong position on. And I hope that I really, really hope that the report that comes out from the BTLR panel does take into consideration what they heard. It does take into consideration where we need to go and does not take into consideration the political context, because that's the second phase of the fight. Laura Tribe: And right now, this is really looking at a system that is the foundation of all of our communications in Canada. It's how we talk to each other. It's how we do business. It's everything about how we operate now. And it can't just be a political football that we're using to toss around. So it's it's been really discouraging to see it politicized, but it's also not that surprising. And hopefully over the course of this election, whoever forms the next government or takes into consideration that, you know, this was something that people went into in good faith. Michael Geist: Now, that's really well said. And I suppose we will have to wait a few months to see what the report says, and of course, less than that to see what the government happens to be. But it is, I think, for a lot of people and I participated as well, discouraging to see the the government, at least the government. But it really almost all the parties sort of take a stake on where they want to where they want to see things go in effect without really taking into account this entire process. What do we do four Quick Hits on other on other issues we really unpack. I think these were the really the two biggest that have captured attention, the next four less so. But let's just make sure we cover all of our bases. Privacy is an issue that people talk a lot about. Has there been much from any of the parties with respect to what they may do on privacy? Laura Tribe: Privacy is the one they've been the most quiet on. I would say when it comes to Internet issues, the Green Party has actually issued the most fulsome plans on privacy of any of the parties to date with a lot of ideas around strengthening the privacy commissioner and their powers, a lot of pieces around making sure that there are data protections in place. I think the one thing that is of concern in the Green Party platform is removing anonymity online for social media platforms. I think it's well intended to try and curb bullying and a lot of harassment online. But fundamentally, anonymity is something that is critical for people who who are the most marginalized in a lot of cases. And so I think that's something that, while well-intended, might not have come across correctly in the people they were trying to help. The conservatives have said that they will launch a new parliamentary committee around cybersecurity and data privacy with no details on what that looks like. The Liberals have talked a lot about privacy around innovation and data and what that looks like in it's part of their new digital charter. But it's really vague on what that actually means for me is as an individual and as a user, there's not a lot of clarity around how we can minimize the amount of data being collected. And fundamentally, the biggest criticism I have of all of the parties on privacy is that not a single one of them, with the exception of the Green Party, thinks that they should be held subject to any privacy laws. And in an election when they are collecting data on us, when they are, you know, using it to try and target us and manipulate us to get our votes. The fact that they're holding themselves to a lower standard than they hold anyone else is appalling. And someone who's trying to uphold democracy. So I think that's my biggest criticism across the board, with the exception that the Greens have said they would bring that. It wasn't that fast for your rapid fire. Michael Geist: No, that was great. And no, and I and I certainly agree with you, have been a recipient of clearly targeted stuff, which raises some questions, too. And I think a lot of Canadians have. There is a long history of political parties of all stripes being willing to impose certain obligations on the private sector, but unwilling to take them on themselves. I mean, that's that's been the case for years. When it comes to political parties closely related to this is that question of platform liability. You touched on it a little bit with respect to the Greens, anything else in terms of hate speech or other sorts of rules when it comes to what. Laura Tribe: We have seen, the liberals say that they will require platforms to take problematic content down within 24 hours and they give a specific definition of what that problematic content would be. It includes hateful content, terrorism content, terrorism related content, incitement to violence. A few others that I can't recall at the moment. But, you know, fundamentally trying to follow in the steps of some European models and following the German model of a 24 hour takedown notice. I think the questions that come up and it's actually a little surprising that content, moderation and some of these issues haven't been more central in the election. But I think the biggest question around that is whose job is it? Is it the governments or is it the companies? And I think that the government don't want it to be theirs. They're trying to incentivize the companies to do it, and the companies don't want it to be theirs. They're really trying to wait until the government makes them do it. And I think that's where we've gotten into a lot of the mess that we're in now. Michael Geist: That's that's perfect. That that fits well with the Quick Hits. Digital trade, digital trade policy, the USMCA. Obviously, there was a fair amount in that trade agreement we've had in some of the other trade agreements, a CPA TPP in the European deal as well. Are any of those digital provisions at risk, including copyright here? Of course, with copyright term extension. The party said much about what they would do with these trade deals. Laura Tribe: You'd probably know the answer to this better than I will. But fundamentally, what we've heard on the trade deals is if you're the liberals, you think it's a good deal. And if you're not the liberals, you think it's a bad deal. Not a lot of talk around the digital issues themselves. Not a lot of talk around the IP provisions. Most of it seems to focus on dairy and a lot of those issues, even though there's a lot more free trade agreement than just dairy. But it hasn't really come up in terms of what's wrong with the deal. We've seen the parties really stick to their talking points around good and bad and haven't seen a lot of detail on that. Michael Geist: No, I think that's why I haven't seen really anything either. It is rather remarkable for people who've been following Canadian politics for some years. I mean, we literally had full elections that were primarily about trade agreements. And here in those last mandate, we've had three trade agreements either closed or negotiated, which fundamentally transform our trading relationship pretty much with the entire world. And yet, as you suggest, there's been practically no talk about it other than it's good or bad without getting into any any level of detail. The one other issue that also is attracted at least some amount of attention over the course of the mandate, most recently with a year long review, was copyright law. The reviews themselves, the review itself coming from the industry committee and there was a supporting document that came from the Heritage Committee, came too late for the government to respond, or at least by the time it was released, the government wasn't required to respond. And so it won't. Has copyright come up at all? Laura Tribe: I haven't seen much talk about copyright, and for something that took well over a year to study that had, you know, cross party examination. It hasn't had much discussion this election. But I also think it was so thoroughly studied by the industry committee. That is a cross-party committee that actually put a report forward that had multiple parties saying we think this is a good plan, that it's not an area of division. In the same way that I think a lot of the other issues that are coming up in this election are. And so without a really clear way to try and distinguish yourself in the other parties, it makes it really hard for it to be an election issue. So we'll see what the next government does with the recommendations that came from the committee. But it it hasn't been as divisive as an issue as it has been in the past. Michael Geist: I think that's a great point, because you had that really extensive study. The committee representing all parties in the parties all came on board with those issues. And so perhaps that's. Why it's not. There's not enough of a wedge there to make much of a difference. Laura, thanks so much for joining me on the podcast. Laura Tribe: Thanks for having me. Michael Geist: The Conservative Party released its election platform on October 11th, one day after this podcast was recorded. The platform does not discuss wireless or Internet affordability, limiting its communications policy to rural broadband issues. The platform also doesn't discuss a digital sales tax or mandated Cancon contribution, often referred to as a Netflix tax. It does, however, envision a 3 percent tax on global technology companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. The conservative platform includes several new policy proposals, including rules that would hold parents liable for cyber bullying by their children and requirements for plain language privacy policies. There is no discussion on further Internet platform liability or copyright reform. Michael Geist: That's the Law Bytes podcast for this week.

Prompted by privacy invasions, the spread of misinformation, a crisis in news funding and potential interference in elections, regulators in several countries now propose a range of interventions to curb the power of digital platforms. A newly published UK inquiry is part of this building global momentum. Read more: Why are Australians still using Facebook? Shortly after Valentine's Day, a committee of the British House of Commons published its final report into disinformation and 'fake news'. It was explicitly directed at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and it was less a love letter than a challenge to a duel. </p><p>The report found: The committee was particularly vexed by Zuckerberg himself, concluding: By choosing not to appear before the Committee \u2026 Mark Zuckerberg has shown contempt. Its far-reaching recommendations included giving the UK's Information Commissioner greater capacity to be '\u2026 an effective 'sheriff in the Wild West of the Internet'.' The law is back in town In December 2018, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) handed down its preliminary report into the impact of digital platforms. It tabled a series of bold proposals . Read more: Digital platforms. Why the ACCC's proposals for Google and Facebook matter big time Then, on February 12, the Cairncross Review - an independent analysis led by UK economist and journalist Frances Cairncross - handed down its report, A Sustainable Future for Journalism . Referring to sustainability of the production and distribution of high-quality journalism, 'Public intervention may be the only remedy,' wrote Cairncross. 'The future of a healthy democracy depends on it.' And a week later, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons issued its challenge in its final report on disinformation and 'fake news': The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight \u2026 only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them. How do the responses of the three reports compare? ACCC inquiry broadest in scope First, it's important to note that the scope of these three inquiries varied significantly. The ongoing ACCC inquiry, billed as a world-first and set to hand down its final report in June, is seeking to assess the impact of digital platforms on media and advertising, with a focus on news. Read more: Attention economy: Facebook delivers traffic but no money for news media The Cairncross Review was narrower in intent, addressing 'the sustainability of the production and distribution of high quality journalism, and especially the future of the press, in this dramatically changing market.' And the House of Commons committee had a very direct brief to investigate fake news. It then chose to focus on Facebook. As such, the three inquiries overlap substantially, but the ACCC investigation is unequivocally the broadest in scope. Not just distribution platforms However, all three reports land in roughly the same place when it comes to characterising these businesses. They all see digital platforms as more than just conduits of other people's content - and this brings certain responsibilities. The ACCC says digital intermediaries are 'considerably more than mere distributors or pure intermediaries' when it comes to the supply of news and journalism. The Cairncross Review stresses there is a 'fundamental difference' between distributors and content creators. The House of Commons committee proposes 'a new category of tech company' as a legal mechanism for having digital platforms assume liability for harmful content. Need more oversight A related important point is that all three reviews recommend that digital platforms are brought more squarely into the legal and regulatory environment. By this, they don't just mean cross-industry laws that apply to all businesses. There is some of that - for example, adapting competition laws so certain conduct is regulated. Read more: Google and Facebook cosy up to media companies in response to the threat of regulation But these inquiries also raise the prospect of specific rules for platforms as part of communications regulation. How they go about this shows the point at which the inquiries diverge. News reliability The ACCC has flagged the need for further work on a platforms code of practice that would bring them into the orbit of the communications regulator, the ACMA. The platforms would be bound to the code, which would require them to badge content produced under established journalistic standards. It would be the content creators - publishers and broadcasters, not platforms - that would be subject to these standards. In the UK, Cairncross proposes a collaborative approach under which a new regulator would monitor and report on platforms' initiatives to improve reliability of news - perhaps, in time, moving to specific regulatory obligations. Algorithms regulator In Australia, the ACCC has proposed what others refer to as a new 'algorithms regulator'. This would look at how ads and news are ranked in search results or placed in news feeds, and whether vertically integrated digital platforms that arrange advertising favour their own services. The algorithms regulator would monitor, investigate and report on activity, but would rely on referral to other regulators rather than have its own enforcement powers. Unsurprisingly, the leading digital platforms in Australia oppose the new algorithms regulator . Equally unsurprisingly, media companies think the proposal doesn't go far enough . Read more: Facebook needs regulation - here's why it should be done by algorithms For its part, Cairncross does recommend new codes on aspects such as indexing and ranking of content and treatment of advertising. The codes would be overseen by a new regulator but they would be developed by platforms and a move to a statutory code would only occur if they were inadequate. In contrast to both these reviews, the House of Commons committee's Code of Ethics is concerned with 'online harms'. Right from the outset, it would be drawn up and enforced by a new regulator in a similar way to Ofcom, the UK communications regulator, enforcing its Broadcasting Code . It says this would create 'a regulatory system for online content that is as effective as that for offline content industries'. Its forcefulness on this is matched by its recommendation on algorithms: it says the new regulator should have access to 'tech companies' security mechanisms and algorithms, to ensure they are operating responsibly'. Both the ACCC and Cairncross pointedly avoid this level of intervention. However, the ACCC does raise the prospect of a new digital platforms ombudsman. Apart from delivering 11 preliminary recommendations, the ACCC also specified nine proposed areas for further analysis and assessment. Among these areas, the ACCC suggested the idea of such an ombudsman to deal with complaints about digital platforms from consumers, advertisers, media companies and businesses. Data privacy And then there is data privacy. This is where the ACCC and the House of Commons committee delivered some of their most significant recommendations. It's also where regulators in other jurisdictions have been turning their attention, often on the understanding that the market power of digital platforms is largely derived from their ability to access user data. Earlier this month, Germany's Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) found that Facebook could no longer merge a person's data from their Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp accounts, without their explicit consent. In Germany, the law has spoken. In Australia and the UK, it's still clearing its throat.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Facebook Social media ACCC Journalism News Digital media Mark Zuckerberg Fake news</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>MENAFN2502201901990000ID1098166094</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098166094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH6-2HF1-F04Y-T4S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1321\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A newly published UK inquiry is part of this building global momentum.  Read more:Why are Australians still using Facebook?  Shortly after Valentine's Day, a committee of the British House of Commons published its final report into disinformation and \"fake news\". It was explicitly directed at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and it was less a love letter than a challenge to a duel.  The report found:      Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like 'digital gangsters' in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law. </p><p> The committee was particularly vexed by Zuckerberg himself, concluding:      By choosing not to appear before the Committee ... Mark Zuckerberg has shown contempt.  Its far-reaching recommendations included giving the UK's Information Commissioner greater capacity to be \"... an effective 'sheriff in the Wild West of the Internet'.\" The law is back in town  In December 2018, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) handed down its preliminary report into the impact of digital platforms. It tabled a series of bold proposals.  Read more:Digital platforms. Why the ACCC's proposals for Google and Facebook matter big time  Then, on February 12, the Cairncross Review - an independent analysis led by UK economist and journalist Frances Cairncross - handed down its report, A Sustainable Future for Journalism.  Referring to sustainability of the production and distribution of high-quality journalism, \"Public intervention may be the only remedy,\" wrote Cairncross. \"The future of a healthy democracy depends on it.\"  And a week later, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons issued its challenge in its final report on disinformation and \"fake news\":      The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight ... only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them.  How do the responses of the three reports compare? ACCC inquiry broadest in scope  First, it's important to note that the scope of these three inquiries varied significantly.  The ongoing ACCC inquiry, billed as a world-first and set to hand down its final report in June, is seeking to assess the impact of digital platforms on media and advertising, with a focus on news.  Read more:Attention economy: Facebook delivers traffic but no money for news media  The Cairncross Review was narrower in intent, addressing \"the sustainability of the production and distribution of high quality journalism, and especially the future of the press, in this dramatically changing market.\"  And the House of Commons committee had a very direct brief to investigate fake news. It then chose to focus on Facebook.  As such, the three inquiries overlap substantially, but the ACCC investigation is unequivocally the broadest in scope. Not just distribution platforms  However, all three reports land in roughly the same place when it comes to characterising these businesses. They all see digital platforms as more than just conduits of other people's content - and this brings certain responsibilities.  The ACCC says digital intermediaries are \"considerably more than mere distributors or pure intermediaries\" when it comes to the supply of news and journalism.  The Cairncross Review stresses there is a \"fundamental difference\" between distributors and content creators.  The House of Commons committee proposes \"a new category of tech company\" as a legal mechanism for having digital platforms assume liability for harmful content. Need more oversight  A related important point is that all three reviews recommend that digital platforms are brought more squarely into the legal and regulatory environment.  By this, they don't just mean cross-industry laws that apply to all businesses. There is some of that - for example, adapting competition laws so certain conduct is regulated.  Read more:Google and Facebook cosy up to media companies in response to the threat of regulation  But these inquiries also raise the prospect of specific rules for platforms as part of communications regulation. How they go about this shows the point at which the inquiries diverge. News reliability  The ACCC has flagged the need for further work on a platforms code of practice that would bring them into the orbit of the communications regulator, the ACMA.  The platforms would be bound to the code, which would require them to badge content produced under established journalistic standards. It would be the content creators - publishers and broadcasters, not platforms - that would be subject to these standards.  In the UK, Cairncross proposes a collaborative approach under which a new regulator would monitor and report on platforms' initiatives to improve reliability of news - perhaps, in time, moving to specific regulatory obligations. Algorithms regulator  In Australia, the ACCC has proposed what others refer to as a new \"algorithms regulator\". This would look at how ads and news are ranked in search results or placed in news feeds, and whether vertically integrated digital platforms that arrange advertising favour their own services.  The algorithms regulator would monitor, investigate and report on activity, but would rely on referral to other regulators rather than have its own enforcement powers.  Unsurprisingly, the leading digital platforms in Australia oppose the new algorithms regulator. Equally unsurprisingly, media companies think the proposal doesn't go far enough.  Read more:Facebook needs regulation - here's why it should be done by algorithms  For its part, Cairncross does recommend new codes on aspects such as indexing and ranking of content and treatment of advertising. The codes would be overseen by a new regulator but they would be developed by platforms and a move to a statutory code would only occur if they were inadequate.  In contrast to both these reviews, the House of Commons committee's Code of Ethics is concerned with \"online harms\". Right from the outset, it would be drawn up and enforced by a new regulator in a similar way to Ofcom, the UK communications regulator, enforcing its Broadcasting Code.  It says this would create \"a regulatory system for online content that is as effective as that for offline content industries\". Its forcefulness on this is matched by its recommendation on algorithms: it says the new regulator should have access to \"tech companies' security mechanisms and algorithms, to ensure they are operating responsibly\".  Both the ACCC and Cairncross pointedly avoid this level of intervention.  However, the ACCC does raise the prospect of a new digital platforms ombudsman. Apart from delivering 11 preliminary recommendations, the ACCC also specified nine proposed areas for further analysis and assessment. Among these areas, the ACCC suggested the idea of such an ombudsman to deal with complaints about digital platforms from consumers, advertisers, media companies and businesses. Data privacy  And then there is data privacy.  This is where the ACCC and the House of Commons committee delivered some of their most significant recommendations. It's also where regulators in other jurisdictions have been turning their attention, often on the understanding that the market power of digital platforms is largely derived from their ability to access user data.  Earlier this month, Germany's Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) found that Facebook could no longer merge a person's data from their Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp accounts, without their explicit consent.  In Germany, the law has spoken. In Australia and the UK, it's still clearing its throat.  Sacha Molitorisz is a postdoctoral research fellow at The Centre for Media Transition at UTS.

It was explicitly directed at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and it was less a love letter than a challenge to a duel. </p><p>The report found: </p><p>Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like 'digital gangsters' in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law. </p><p>The committee was particularly vexed by Zuckerberg himself, concluding: </p><p>By choosing not to appear before the Committee ... Mark Zuckerberg has shown contempt.</p><p>Its far-reaching recommendations included giving the UK's Information Commissioner greater capacity to be \"... an effective 'sheriff in the Wild West of the Internet'.\"</p><h>The law is back in town</h><p>In December 2018, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/\">ACCC</url>) handed down       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries/digital-platforms-inquiry/preliminary-report\">its preliminary report</url> into the impact of digital platforms. It tabled       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/digital-platforms-why-the-acccs-proposals-for-google-and-facebook-matter-big-time-108501\">a series of bold proposals</url>. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Digital platforms. Why the ACCC's proposals for Google and Facebook matter big time</emphasis></p><p>Then, on February 12, the Cairncross Review - an independent analysis led by UK economist and journalist Frances Cairncross - handed down its report, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-cairncross-review-a-sustainable-future-for-journalism\">A Sustainable Future for Journalism</url>. </p><p>Referring to sustainability of the production and distribution of high-quality journalism, \"Public intervention may be the only remedy,\" wrote Cairncross. \"The future of a healthy democracy depends on it.\"  </p><p>And a week later, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons issued its challenge in its final report on disinformation and \"fake news\": </p><p>The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight ... only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them.</p><p>How do the responses of the three reports compare?  </p><h>ACCC inquiry broadest in scope</h><p>First, it's important to note that the scope of these three inquiries varied significantly. </p><p>The ongoing ACCC inquiry, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/competition-watchdog-suggests-new-ombudsman-to-handle-google-and-facebook-20181210-p50l80.html\">billed as a world-first</url> and set to hand down its final report in June, is seeking to assess the impact of digital platforms on media and advertising, with a focus on news.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Attention economy: Facebook delivers traffic but no money for news media</emphasis></p><p>The Cairncross Review was narrower in intent, addressing \"the sustainability of the production and distribution of high quality journalism, and especially the future of the press, in this dramatically changing market.\" </p><p>And the House of Commons committee had a very direct brief to investigate fake news. It then chose to focus on Facebook. </p><p>As such, the three inquiries overlap substantially, but the ACCC investigation is unequivocally the broadest in scope.</p><h>Not just distribution platforms</h><p>However, all three reports land in roughly the same place when it comes to characterising these businesses. They all see digital platforms as more than just conduits of other people's content - and this brings certain responsibilities. </p><p>The ACCC says digital intermediaries are \"considerably more than mere distributors or pure intermediaries\" when it comes to the supply of news and journalism. </p><p>The Cairncross Review stresses there is a \"fundamental difference\" between distributors and content creators. </p><p>The House of Commons committee proposes \"a new category of tech company\" as a legal mechanism for having digital platforms assume liability for harmful content.</p><h>Need more oversight</h><p>A related important point is that all three reviews recommend that digital platforms are brought more squarely into the legal and regulatory environment. </p><p>By this, they don't just mean cross-industry laws that apply to all businesses. There is some of that - for example, adapting competition laws so certain conduct is regulated. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Google and Facebook cosy up to media companies in response to the threat of regulation</emphasis></p><p>But these inquiries also raise the prospect of specific rules for platforms as part of communications regulation. How they go about this shows the point at which the inquiries diverge.</p><h>News reliability</h><p>The ACCC has flagged the need for further work on a platforms code of practice that would bring them into the orbit of the communications regulator, the ACMA. </p><p>The platforms would be bound to the code, which would require them to badge content produced under established journalistic standards. It would be the content creators - publishers and broadcasters, not platforms - that would be subject to these standards.</p><p>In the UK, Cairncross proposes a collaborative approach under which a new regulator would monitor and report on platforms' initiatives to improve reliability of news - perhaps, in time, moving to specific regulatory obligations.</p><h>Algorithms regulator</h><p>In Australia, the ACCC has proposed what others refer to as a new \"algorithms regulator\". This would look at how ads and news are ranked in search results or placed in news feeds, and whether vertically integrated digital platforms that arrange advertising favour their own services. </p><p>The algorithms regulator would monitor, investigate and report on activity, but would rely on referral to other regulators rather than have its own enforcement powers.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the leading digital platforms in Australia <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/facebook-fightback-accc-has-not-made-the-case-for-its-most-striking-plan-20190217-p50ych.html\">oppose the new algorithms regulator</url>. Equally unsurprisingly,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/tv-industry-calls-for-facebook-news-feed-transparency-and-journalism-tax-breaks\">media companies think the proposal doesn't go far enough</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Facebook needs regulation - here's why it should be done by algorithms</emphasis></p><p>For its part, Cairncross does recommend new codes on aspects such as indexing and ranking of content and treatment of advertising. The codes would be overseen by a new regulator but they would be developed by platforms and a move to a statutory code would only occur if they were inadequate.</p><p>In contrast to both these reviews, the House of Commons committee's Code of Ethics is concerned with \"online harms\". Right from the outset, it would be drawn up and enforced by a new regulator in a similar way to Ofcom, the UK communications regulator, enforcing its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv-radio-and-on-demand/broadcast-codes/broadcast-code\">Broadcasting Code</url>.</p><p>It says this would create \"a regulatory system for online content that is as effective as that for offline content industries\". Its forcefulness on this is matched by its recommendation on algorithms: it says the new regulator should have access to \"tech companies' security mechanisms and algorithms, to ensure they are operating responsibly\". </p><p>Both the ACCC and Cairncross pointedly avoid this level of intervention.</p><p>However, the ACCC does raise the prospect of a new digital platforms ombudsman. Apart from delivering 11 preliminary recommendations, the ACCC also specified nine proposed areas for further analysis and assessment. Among these areas, the ACCC suggested the idea of such an ombudsman to deal with complaints about digital platforms from consumers, advertisers, media companies and businesses.</p><h>Data privacy</h><p>And then there is data privacy. </p><p>This is where the ACCC and the House of Commons committee delivered some of their most significant recommendations. It's also where regulators in other jurisdictions have been turning their attention, often on the understanding that the market power of digital platforms is largely derived from their ability to access user data.</p><p>Earlier this month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/germany-facebook-antitrust-ruling/\">Germany's Federal Cartel Office</url> (Bundeskartellamt) found that Facebook could no longer merge a person's data from their Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp accounts, without their explicit consent.</p><p>In Germany, the law has spoken. In Australia and the UK, it's still clearing its throat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sacha Molitorisz is a postdoctoral research fellow at The Centre for Media Transition at UTS.

Early attempts to understand this phenomenon were often optimistic in tone. In our new information age, influential voices argued, we could live more freely and with less scarcity, leveraging the nonrivalry of information, innate human tendencies to create, (1) and the wisdom of crowds. (2) Digital networks were celebrated for empowering sharing and new forms of creative production, (3) and information technologies were commonly described as enabling--if not guaranteeing--a more empowering workplace and higher living standards for all. (4)</p><p>Today's mood about these technological developments is decidedly darker, filtered through a myriad of recent revelations. Facebook has experimented on us to influence our emotional states. (5) Cambridge Analytica sought to mobilize surreptitiously harvested Facebook data to influence elections. (6) Trolls and bots -some independent, others backed by governments--use social-media platforms deliberately to sow discord and spread misinformation. (7) Evidence has emerged that click-driven social media may have polarizing effects. (8) Employers are using digital technologies to watch and manipulate workers. (9) We have begun to worry that these new capabilities are changing who we are--that our relationships, sleep, concentration, and even our humanity are being unraveled by our compulsive relationships to computers, apps, and social networks.

SHOSHANA ZUBOFF, THE AGE OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM : THE FIGHT FORA HUMAN FUTURE AT THE NEW FRONTIER OF POWER (2019).</p><p>Smith, Max Weber, Karl Polanyi, Thomas Piketty, and Karl Marx. (12) It also has been dubbed the Silent Spring of the information age. (13) ZubofPs argument is structured as an urgent call to action: we have entered a new era of \"surveillance capitalism,\" she contends, that operates by \"unilaterally claim[ing] human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data,\" and processing that data to \"anticipate what you will do now, soon, and later.\" (14) Companies operating in this mode seek not just to predict but to \"shape our behavior at scale.\" (15) Companies like Google and Facebook possess, she declares, a new species of \"in-strumentarian power,\" the power to \"shape[] human behavior toward others' ends.\" (16) The result: an economic system that \"will thrive at the expense of human nature and will threaten to cost us our humanity.\" (17)</p><p>I describe the core of ZubofPs account in Part I-- and its virtues. The book is extraordinarily acute in its grasp of the business models and aspirations of the largest internet firms and describes in exquisite detail why they are deeply troubling. And while overwritten and overlong, the account is also strikingly accessible. In an age of information glut, where so much private power is accumulated in secret, it is no small thing to break through the noise to articulate complex problems and ideas. But by this same token, it is of real significance if the account is partial or misleading. And in important ways, it is.</p><p>Zuboff is right that our autonomy and individuality are today at risk in new ways. But she has little to say about the monopoly power of new platforms, or about their role in reshaping labor markets and intensifying forms of inequality. She ignores the fact that we are not all equally vulnerable to these new forms of power. Part of the problem, as I will describe, is her relentless focus on individual autonomy and her cheery attitude toward all forms of capitalism that are not organized around surveillance. Given the manifesto-like quality of the book, it is something of a shock when you realize that ZubofFs dream is a world dominated by firms like Apple, instead of firms like Google. (18) That view, once uncovered, has little appeal, nor does it help us think about many of the extraordinarily important modes of private power facilitated by information technologies today.</p><p>Zuboff also claims at several points that surveillance capitalism is built on \"lawlessness.\" (19) In her account, markets in data exist beyond law and operate by their own rules. It is not hard to see where she gets this view: dip into legal scholarship and you will quicldy learn that no one owns data. (20) But the view that the operations of Google and Facebook occur in a law-free zone--or even that those companies would so desire--is wrong. It conceals the degree to which these companies rely upon law for their power and the many legal decisions that could be altered to enhance public power. If we are to intervene to democratize the forms of private power Zuboff describes, we must understand how law helps to construct them.</p><p>Fortunately, Julie Cohen has written a book that gives us a better, broader framework through which to understand private power in the information age and that also does superb work to trace how law has shaped (and been shaped by) that power. In Between Truth and Power: The Legal Constructions of Informational Capitalism, Cohen argues that we live not in an age of \"surveillance\" capitalism--which trains our focus on dynamics of surveillance and behavioral control--but in an age of \"informational capitalism\"--which focuses our attention on informationalism as a broader mode of development in the contemporary political economy. (21) Her broader framework captures transformations across a much wider range of settings and calls attention not only to Zuboff's instrumen-tarian power but also to rising platform power, monopoly power, and the power that technology can give capital over workers and governments over the governed. She also shows how these changes are mediated at every moment by law: for example, law has enabled de facto property regimes in both data and algorithms, although neither are formally property. (22)</p><p>Cohen's account is complex and extremely dense: it demands patience of the reader and requires some elaboration, which I undertake in Part II. The reward is substantial: Cohen allows us sophisticated insight into the law and political economy of the reigning productive paradigm. (23) Building upon it in Part III, I aim to sketch what we might call the \"law of informational capitalism\" and add an account of the conceptual moves that have helped bring this law about.</p><p>How do allegedly assetless wonders like Uber and Airbnb mobilize capital and extract profits? They rely upon laws that have been transformed to enable the creation and accumulation of immaterial capital. These include changes across a wide range of fields such as trade secrecy, contract, intermediary immunities, privacy, and the First Amendment. Historians of capitalism and neoliberalism have emphasized how both systems have enacted not just laws that enable markets but also laws that protect them from democratic majorities that might remake them. Informational capitalism, I show, is no different. Three moves are critical here: the attempt to absorb trade secrets and data as forms of property protected from \"takings\" and from government disclosure; the attempt to insulate the activities of data brokers and software companies by claiming that they are purveyors of speech protected by the First Amendment; and the attempt to insulate markets from domestic control by internationalizing key components of the law of informational capitalism. All three could be mobilized to make the building of democratic power over informational capitalism difficult, and all three will be the terrain of significant struggle as such efforts unfold.</p><p>These three forms of encasement are evidence that informational capitalism brings a threat not merely to our individual subjectivities but to our ability to self-govern. Questions of data and democracy, not just data and dignity, must be at the core of our concern today. By mapping the law of data capitalism as a series of doctrines, statutes, and underlying logics, we can begin to see how law, legal thought, and technical systems have worked together to enable substantial new forms of private power. We can also explore the levers we have to tame them.</p><p>Legal scholarship has an important role to play here. Cohen's book shows that law and legal thought have played key facilitating roles in these developments. The wave of legal changes required to enable today's extreme concentrations of private power were ushered in by ideas and tropes distinctive to our neoliberal era. (24) The \"open access\" movement, and the publicly minded intellectual-property scholars who influenced its shape (of which I am one), as I will describe, did not escape the gravity exerted by this era. Though we did not wish it, our ideas have helped consolidate, or at least have not adequately contested, these vast new forms of private power. Today, we need a new departure for legal scholarship in this domain and a more serious engagement with the political economy of data, grounded in the recognition that data is a social relation--an artifact not only of human cognition but also of legal structures. (25)</p><p>I. THE POWER AND LIMITS OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM</p><p>A. The Rise of Surveillance Capitalism</p><p>Zuboff develops her definition of surveillance capitalism substantially through a close analysis of one trailblazing firm: Google. In the beginning, Google was just an ordinary capitalist firm working under a model that Zuboff calls \"advocacy-oriented capitalism.\" This was a virtuous form, exemplified by Apple and its iPod, that fused digitization and capitalism to better serve users and provide a more individuated, less \"mass\" consumer experience. (26) Google was born in this era, and originally followed its pattern: it used our online \"data exhaust\" to turn its \"search engine into a recursive learning system that constantly improved search results.\" (27) Our online traces were, it realized, a \"broad sensor of human behavior,\" which when combined and analyzed could yield extraordinary insights. (28) By feeding data about website links, click-through rates, and revealed interests into its Page Rank algorithm, Google could provide us with more accurate search results. (29) This lesson was soon applied to other \"product innovations such as spell check, translation, and voice recognition.\" (30)</p><p>To understand the story here, it helps to know a little about recent technological developments in data processing. Decades of developments in computer processing power and the connection of processors in digital networks have allowed information to be gathered and exchanged in new ways. Over time, advances in computer processing speed and storage, the development of pervasively distributed sensors, and advances in machine-learning techniques have ushered in what some call the \"second machine age,\" enabling quantitative shifts in how we know and act. (31) While early computers were very good at rule-following, they were poor at pattern recognition and adapting to changing environments. (32) Machine-learning techniques now allow machines to \"learn\" by extracting patterns from massive datasets. While this is decidedly less than real intelligence, it has enabled significant new forms of technological power. It allowed computers to master humankind's most difficult strategy game, Go, which has more possible moves than atoms in the observable universe. (33) It is what companies hope will soon allow computers to outstrip radiologists in interpreting mammograms. (34) It is also the technology behind self-driving cars, Google's Page Rank, and Google Translate.</p><p>It was in 2002, Zuboff argues, that everything changed. This was the year that Google discovered what she calls \"behavioral surplus\"--forms of data useful for something other than improving products and services. In Google's case, the purpose was to generate its first profitable business model: the sale of behaviorally targeted ads. (35) Google's profits today are almost exclusively from such advertising (36) and the market it has constructed to sell these ads is mind-boggling. In order to maximize the value of the ad space it sells, Google mobilizes its vast troves of data to profile each user with increasing granularity. In early versions, this meant evaluating previous websites we had visited, ads we had seen before, and feedback on how we reacted to them to try to predict whether we would be lured in by a particular product or ad. (37)</p><p>The truth is, we do not know exactly what inputs Google uses these days, any more than we can accurately describe its data holdings. But Zuboff pieces together an outline of the evolution through patents, press releases, statements by employees, and news coverage. As the advertising model became more embedded at Google, the company realized that better predictions led to better click-through rates, and this generated a demand for ever-more comprehensive data on Google users (which is effectively all of us, since Google captures about 92% of worldwide search engine traffic and 95% of searches on mobile phones). (38) It then matched its data holdings with a virtual auction house, enabling bidders to consider how likely the user is to click on the ad. Google now conducts trillions of these auctions simultaneously, every day. (39)</p><p>It is by generalizing from Google's trajectory that Zuboff derives her definitions of surveillance capitalism. In this new mode, people are not users whom companies seek to serve but \"objects from which raw materials are extracted and expropriated.\" (40) Our data is then fed into \"prediction factories\" to monetize a guess about our desires and what we will do--or can be subtly pressed to do -next. The need for ever-more data to increase the accuracy of these predictions has led data hunters from the online world to the offline world. As Zuboff puts it, \"If Google is a search company, why is it investing in smart-home devices, wearables, and self-driving cars? If Facebook is a social network, why is it developing drones and augmented reality?\" (41) In fact, she argues, they are driven \"to hunt and capture raw material,\" and the key move today is off the internet. (42) She quotes Google's former CEO, Eric Schmidt:</p><p>The internet will disappear. There will be so many IP addresses... so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with, that you won't even sense it. It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room and the room is dynamic.</p><p>First, companies tracked our searches. Then they correlated that tracking with data gathered from our browsers and phones. Companies learned that apps were powerful sensors too, gleaning information about our habits, our health, our friends. (44) Apps frequently access one another's information, and Google and Facebook can do the same. With GIS and mobile payment systems attached to our devices, integrating other datasets with the data on our phones generated still more value for advertisers. (45)</p><p>As Zuboff describes, there is now a wave of new products \"from smart vodka bottles to internet-enabled rectal thermometers, and quite literally everything in between\" that are designed to sense our activities and transmit this behavioral data for unknowable future uses. (46) Companies tout their \"interactive denim\" that can detect your \"contextual activity, health and emotional state.\" (47) The market in healthcare apps has exploded, providing a means to combine data that users provide with other information on their phones to generate profiles rich with highly sensitive information. (48) Internet-enabled Smart TVs--present in almost half of U.S. homes as of 2017--constantly track what users are watching and relay it back to enable targeted advertising. (49)</p><p>All of this, Zuboff argues, enables \"instrumentarianism,\" a new form of power that allows firms to control us in machinic ways. (50) She quotes a software engineer: \"The new power is action .... [S]ensors can also be actuators .... It's no longer simply about ubiquitous computing. Now the real aim is ubiquitous intervention, action, and control. The real power is that now you can modify realtime actions in the real world.\" (51)</p><p>One expression of this is what Zuboff calls the \"uncontract\"--the ability of firms, through software, to enforce contractual terms immediately and nonne-gotiably. (52) When combined with new surveillance power, this ability to act at a distance takes on some undeniably inhumane qualities. Your car can be disabled, perhaps at a stoplight or on your way to the hospital, if you fail to make a car payment. (53) Health-insurance companies can ask that you comply with exercise regimes and use sensors and digital networks to be sure you do. Smart machines inserted into our daily lives have ways of governing us--not by manipulating our minds but by defining our options in binary code. In a simple way, this was the point of Lawrence Lessig's influential 1999 book Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace. (54) Code could work like a land of law, Lessig wrote, because it could create the parameters of action. (55) And as Mireille Hildebrandt recently pointed out, technological regulation is different from legal regulation in several important ways: it is not democratically authored; it rules out disobedience in a technical, material sense; and it is often practically impossible to contest because its operations are largely invisible and beyond the reach of any court. (56)</p><p>This land of algorithmic control, though, is of secondary concern for Zuboff. It is psychic control that she most fears. Today, Zuboff argues, firms can \"herd,\" \"tune,\" and \"condition\" us via digital action. (57) She offers two signal examples. One is Pokemon Go, the game craze that led millions of people to reorganize how they moved through physical space (sometimes visiting stores that paid to serve as a destination) in an effort to catch virtual creatures. (58) The other is Face-book's study showing it could increase voter turnout by manipulating messages on the feeds of millions of users. (59) As this illustrates, and as Google's chief economist argued long ago, the ubiquity of computer interfaces has enabled new forms of corporate experimentation. (60) With continuous data flows, networks, and surveillance capacities, companies like Google and Facebook now can run millions of secret tests a day to optimize their profitability. This creates significant new potential for these firms to probe us and alter what we do. Zuboff s account is at its most chilling when she quotes executives themselves. Here, for example, is the CEO of an \"emotion scanning\" firm: \"[I]n the future, we'll assume that every device just knows how to read your emotions.\" (61) Once our devices know our emotions, they will be able, Zuboff assures us, to fine-tune their ability to profit from us and to keep us jacked into the networks like so many brains in a Matrix vat. At the core of Zuboffs concern is not surveillance or capitalism, but this new threat of a machine-driven \"collectivism.\" (62)</p><p>Zuboffs account is important. It offers an extraordinary and vivid account of the power that private actors, mobilizing vast and interactive troves of data, may soon have to influence our behavior, and it shows how the business models of some of the world's most dynamic and valuable firms are fundamentally misaligned with our interests in control over our lives. She lays bare dynamics that are deliberately obscured from most of us, and convincingly situates the rise of this power in incentives and business models, as well as the weak regulatory culture that has characterized the last two decades (particularly in the United States). But the book, ultimately, is not the guide to the problem of private power in the digital age that we need today.</p><p>B. The Limits of Zuboffs Account</p><p>Zuboff makes a convincing case that technologies of the present facilitate a new paradigm of private power--one that appropriates our data for profit, dominated by a few companies that create significant new threats to our autonomy. But is it really the case that surveillance, the sale of predictions about human behaviors, and engineering of behavioral responses will be the core value proposition in the global economy going forward? (63) As others have pointed out, Zuboff declares rather than defends the claim. (64)</p><p>The existing evidence suggests that until behavioral advertising becomes much more sophisticated, it will have at most a small impact on behavior. (65) In example after example, celebrated Al-driven projects also have fallen short of their billing. (66) There is good reason to treat with caution claims made by executives and engineers about the vast new powers that lie just around the bend. Still, it would be foolish to dismiss the concerns Zuboff raises, because studies of the impact of behavioral marketing are still few and limited, and because these powers will grow as analytics, digital profiles, and processing become more sophisticated.</p><p>The bigger problem with Zuboff's account is that her fixation on threats to our autonomy screens out broader and arguably more important problems of private power in the information age--for example, the ways in which network effects feed platform power, informationalism generates winner-take-all dynamics, and digital technology has impacted labor.</p><p>This is in part a product of ZubofPs underlying attitude toward capitalism. As Evgeny Morozov has pointed out in an insightful review, ZubofPs favored alternative to capitalism is not socialism, but \"advocacy-oriented\" capitalism, which deploys technologies to better improve services. (67) This is capitalism as populated by companies not like Google, but like Apple (which has eschewed the data-harvesting model and does more to protect privacy). Its embodiment in Zuboff's book is Apple's iPod, which she argues \"rescue[d]\" trapped assets -songs--and helped \"connect[] us to what we really want in exactly the ways that we choose.\" (68) Though it is hard to believe given the book's many citations to Marx, this move from mass to more individual consumerism is one that Zuboff views as profoundly freeing: she credits it with \"confirm[ing] ... our inner sense of dignity and worth, ratifying the feeling that we matter.\" (69) She notes only in passing that Apple has been criticized for \"missteps\" such as \"extractive pricing policies, offshoring jobs, exploiting its retail staff, abrogating responsibility for factory conditions, colluding to depress wages via illicit noncompete agreements in employee recruitment, institutionalized tax evasion, and a lack of environmental stewardship\"--but apparently sees these as having no deep relation to the advocacy-capitalist order she celebrates. (70)</p><p>Zuboff longs not for any fundamental reworking of our market order, but for a capitalism with the humanity of old. In one of the more astonishing passages in the book, Zuboff waxes lyrical about what it was like when the \"repo man\" was a human. She tells the story of Jim Ford, who came to repossess a car from an elderly couple and learned that they were being \"forced to choose between buying medicine and making their car payments.\" (71) Ford was so moved by their story that he paid their debt himself. Then a crowdfunding effort was launched, enabling the couple not only to pay off their car but also to buy a Thanksgiving turkey. (72) It is unclear how many readers will find this story as heartwarming as Zuboff does. It says quite a lot about her comfort with the basic assumption that our economic order will put people to devastating choices and that help, if it comes, will not be something anyone can count upon.</p><p>Problems of monopoly and inequality also make scant appearance in Zuboff's account. (73) What of the power Amazon has over its workers, or over local businesses, or over those who sell on its marketplace while Amazon watches and tries to outcompete them? This form of private power, too, is nearly absent in ZubofPs account. These are no small things. American industry has grown more concentrated in recent decades, (74) and recent studies suggest that concentration is hurting both wages (75) and investment. (76) Notably, concentration in the U.S. economy is especially high in the telecommunications and IT sectors. (77) In the United States today, for example, Google governs 89% of all internet searches. (78) Almost all young adults use a Facebook product. (79) Duopolies are also common: Google and Facebook received 63% of online ad spending in 2017. (80) Google and Apple command 99% of the mobile-phone market, and Apple and Microsoft dominate a similar share of the desktop-computing market. (81) There are in fact plausible reasons to think that information-intensive markets may incline toward concentration: information is often characterized by high average cost and low marginal costs, and digital networks exhibit network effects.</p><p>The corporate sector also exhibits its own \"one-percent\" problem today: among all American firms, the top five hundred account for nearly half of the profits. (82) Information technologies plausibly accelerate such winner-take-all dynamics. The informational sector is highly scalable, particularly as digital technologies reduce the cost of reproducing and disseminating information. This enables providers with small advantages to capture larger shares of the market. (83)</p><p>Income inequality is also on the rise, particularly in the United States, (84) and median wages for American workers have stagnated for the last four decades. (85) A robust economics literature associates technological change in recent decades with widespread wage stagnation and winner-take-all dynamics that provide extraordinary returns to those at the top. (86) As Yochai Benkler has shown, it would be wrong to see these effects as preordained by information technologies, because technological developments are endogenous, and both technology and markets are shaped by social forces and law. (87) Nonetheless, as he also describes, we can see technologies as embedding social forces in ways that can have their own influence and affordances, so it is coherent to ask about the way that information technologies in their current form are bound up in dynamics of increasing inequality, stagnation, and market concentration. (88)</p><p>Zuboff's relentlessly individualistic account of the problem of private power also obscures an important social reality: we will not all be impacted by the rise of big data and surveillance in the same way. (89) Capitalism evolves in history, in civilizations replete with many forms of hierarchy. (90) Modern tools of surveillance and prediction are being deployed against a background of material, embedded inequality; and some of the most devastating human implications will not be for suburban teenagers lost in an Instagram cloud but for the disabled cut off from support by automated programs and for the accused caught up in flawed bail algorithms. (91) Digital profiles will produce new stratifications of their own--for example, dividing people into \"high-value\" and \"high-risk\" categories, so that marketers can reach lucrative groups and exclude undesired groups from their offers. (92) Palantir sells its services to police, government agencies, and private companies that can pay for its costly predictive profiling tools and not to the defendants or community-based groups that cannot. (93) Algorithms that are trained on historical data can be expected to reproduce and even entrench forms of bias, whether because of bias in datasets, in algorithmic design, or simply in the embedded social structures that algorithms code as inputs. (94) These forms of bias will be difficult to address in courts that have been hostile to expansive disparate-impact claims and that think about discrimination in increasingly formalistic terms. (95) Just beyond this horizon looms a climate catastrophe, which will also be dramatically differentially distributed. Though not often noted, AI is extraordinarily energy intensive: training just one machine-learning model to process natural language requires as much energy as the production and use of one U.S. car over its lifetime. (96) Freeing some people up to find TV shows exquisitely mapped to their taste--all else equal, and without dramatic change--means putting other people up to their necks in water. Totalizing narratives of \"us\" and \"we\" will have trouble engaging the critical distributive stakes of our deeply stratified societies.</p><p>Finally, to understand and react to private power, we need a secure grasp of what sustains it. Here, too, Zuboff's account falls short. In her telling, markets in data exist beyond law and operate by their own rules. She describes Google as operating in a manner similar to British capitalists in far-flung colonies, where \"lawlessness\" reigned. (97) At several other points in the book, Zuboff similarly insists that surveillance capitalism demands, or is sustained by, lawlessness. (98) We might read this as a reference to the fact that data is unowned, and so free for the talcing--but as we will see in a moment, there are important ways in which data can be subject to property-like rights. As the legal realists showed, too, it is deeply misleading to describe modern markets as in any sense operating outside of law. One of the great challenges of understanding the new concentrations of corporate power in the informational age is mapping the laws that help sustain them, precisely because this is a domain that is commonly seen as operating beyond law. While Zuboff does in passing point to a few aspects of the legal regime that have helped surveillance capitalist firms consolidate their power, (99) her account does little to help us with this task. And because she has little interest in how law structures the social relations at the heart of surveillance capitalism (and indeed, all forms of capitalism), she cannot give us a map that can orient efforts at change. Instead, Zuboff leaves us with vague bromides--asking us, for example, to \"rekindle a sense of outrage and loss over what is being taken from us.\" (100) We need a different land of account to channel outrage into a platform for democratic change.</p><p>II. PRIVATE POWER IN AN ACE OF INFORMATIONAL CAPITALISM</p><p>Julie Cohen's new book gives us the beginnings of just such an account. It brings together a more convincing and capacious understanding of the \"informational\" mode of development of capitalism today and develops a dense and rich account of the shifts in law and political economy that have constituted it. To understand her broader framing of the dynamics of what she calls \"informational\" capitalism today and the role law has played in this process, it helps to begin with an articulation of the nature of capitalism itself and of its relationship to law.</p><p>A. Capitalism and Its Laws</p><p>As David Grewal describes, it was Karl Marx and his successors who first popularized the term \"capitalism,\" to denote \"modern societies in which the majority of the population meets its needs through specialized production in a complex division of labor determined through commercial exchange.\" (101) In a capitalist society, both workers and producers \"depend on the market\" for access to the means of production. (102) Appropriation of surplus depends critically on the mechanisms of the market--it occurs predominantly through the \"purely 'economic' mechanisms of the market,\" rather than \"on 'extra-economic' powers of appropriation by means of direct coercion--such as the military, political, and judicial powers that enable feudal lords to extract surplus labour from peasants.\" (103)</p><p>Capitalism has a history: it originated in Western Europe in the modern era, following the enclosure movement and the end of feudalism. (104) Part of that history, though, is a just-so story that treats it as \"the natural realization of ever-present tendencies.\" (105) Accounts prior to Marx described the evolution of capitalism as the emergence of \"commercial society,\" (106) ordered not by the state but by a land of natural or divine law. (107) The ordering of commercial society responded to a set of assumptions about human nature that are often associated with the work of Adam Smith. (108) Smith argued, famously, that man possessed a natural tendency to \"truck, barter, and exchange.\" (109) The mechanisms of modern commercial society that created an advanced division of labor allow each individual in pursuit of their own selfishness to produce a good society through the invisible hand of the marketplace, which encourages ever more productive uses of resources. (110)</p><p>This idea of market autonomy--indeed, the very idea of a separate realm called \"the economy\"--is rooted in a series of powerful conceptual distinctions that were encoded in legal systems as capitalism emerged. One is the distinction between \"private\" and \"public\" realms, the former denoting the realm of the \"economy\" and the latter of \"politics.\" (111) In legal orders, these distinctions are encoded in rules that construct distinct realms of private power (for example, through rules of property and contract) and a separate, insulated realm of state or public power. (112) As Grewal writes,</p><p>[C] apitalism is not (or not merely) a socioeconomic system. It is a juridical regime. It is a form of the modern \"rule of law.\" It is legitimated through constitutional ratification by an ultimate popular sovereign that then rules in theory, without in practice surrendering governmental administration to ongoing popular control. The effect of this regime is that emanation of commercial sociability we now call \"the economy.\" It is produced as the outworking of legal rights and duties that offer special protections to asset-holders legitimated through a constitutional order. (113)</p><p>Property and contract are among the foundational legal techniques that create a \"market\" that can operate to allocate factors of production. Another distinction that emerged at the origins of capitalism, between the sovereignty of the people and the government, enabled the emergence of legal orders that could claim a democratic warrant, while also ensuring that \"the entrenched legal rules underlying commercial society [could be] given effect through ongoing governmental operations.\" (114)</p><p>These distinctions, along with the hypostatization of a \"natural\" market order, found powerful expression at the turn of the twentieth century in the doctrine of laissez-faire. (115) Written into the U.S. Constitution in the Lochner decision, (116) the doctrine held that the state could not interfere with natural rights to contract and property, eventually provoking the great constitutional crisis of 1937. (117) Legal realism, formulated in response to laissez-faire, powerfully repudiated its description of the relationship between law and markets. There was a lie at the heart of laissez-faire: markets do not exist outside of law, so as to make state regulation an unjust incursion into a natural order. Rather, as Robert Hale and his contemporaries described, coercion is \"present in the private sphere as well,\" because in acts of market exchange each side \"coerce[s] the other to relinquish its property or services by a (legally sanctioned) threat to withhold its own property or services if the demanded terms [are] not obtained in exchange.\" (118) Coercion is thus ubiquitous in markets, and markets rely on law for their \"nature.\" (119)</p><p>The realist critique helped bring about an end to laissez-faire as a reigning constitutional ideology, but the division between politics and the economy has reappeared in new guises. This is not, in fact, surprising, given the centrality of the idea of a distinct \"economy\" that follows its own rules to capitalist order. As colleagues and I describe in a forthcoming Yale Law Journal Feature, the intellectual tradition of law and economics has helped to reconstruct the distinction on new normative terrain. (120) In laissez-faire, the mandate of noninterference was described as an expression of natural-law principles of liberty, rooted in conceptions of the divine. The realists showed that modern markets are shot through with the coercive power of the state and that the legitimate use of the state -whether through enforcement of market rules or others--required \"some normative theory of what forms of coercive constraints society wished to prohibit and what forms to allow.\" (121) Law and economics reconstructed the politics/economy distinction through precisely such a normative theory--the appeal to \"efficiency.\"</p><p>Efficiency here is described as a virtue because it provides a technical, neutral means to improve wealth in the economic sector, which (it is posited) can be later redistributed to address other normative goals, such as fairness. (122) Efficiency in this rubric is typically defined through the \"Kaldor-Hicks\" criteria, recommending any action that would increase overall consumer and producer surplus, so that in theory the winner could compensate the loser. If a city park has to be located, it should be located where it will be \"valued\" the most--with value typically measured in dollar-denominated demand. If a rich neighborhood values it more, because residents pay more for leisure services, the park should be sited there and any compensation undertaken in the political system. (123) Critics of Kaldor-Hicks efficiency, particularly when expressed as \"wealth maximization\" as I have described it, have decisively refuted its moral appeal, so much so that its leading proponents purported to abandon it. (124) Nevertheless, efficiency as a value has persisted, alongside a broader set of arguments emanating from Chicago School economics that suggested that we would all be better off (read: the world would be more efficient) if markets were maximally left alone and freed from intrusive regulation. (125)</p><p>As my coauthors and I have argued, this revised vision of the autonomous economy found expression not only in common law or \"private\" law domains, but also in \"public\" law domains, such as constitutional law. For example, increasingly conservative courts have revised free speech law to frustrate democratic regulation of both firms and money in politics and have retreated from any view of fundamental rights that recognized the interconnection between our economic and political orders. (126) The result is a new \"Twentieth-Century Synthesis\" that has revived and transmuted the spirit of laissez-faire, with similarly problematic results. One is a set of legal fields and concepts that create the appearance of an \"independent\" market that follows its own rules. Another is the curtailing of democratic authority over the economy, and over many supporting institutions (such as the carceral state) that undergird our capitalist order.</p><p>Emerging \"law and political economy\" approaches such as these seek to make sense of how we have arrived at a new apparent division between economy and politics and to develop critiques and visions of transformative legal reforms that can help bring about a deeper and more genuine democracy, including a democracy of the economy. Cohen's book is self-consciously engaged in this new approach. (127) It begins with a set of trenchant insights about how capitalism has been modified by the developmental mode of informationalism, facilitated by key conceptual and legal developments.</p><p>B. Informational Capitalism and the Rise of Platform Power</p><p>Cohen sets forth the core argument of her book in the first paragraph: as the political economy of our informational age changes, \"our legal institutions too are undergoing transformation, and the two sets of processes are inextricably related.\" (128) As Cohen describes, her aim is to problematize any simple optimism about new information technologies that presents them as inherently \"technologies of freedom\" and any simple pessimism that sees in them the end of \"more humane traditions of governance.\" (129) Whatever our fate--and Cohen resists the pressure to prognosticate--the premise from which both camps begin is wrong:</p><p>Information technologies are highly configurable, and their configurability offers multiple points of entry for interested and well-resourced parties to shape their development. To understand what technology signifies for the future of law, we must understand how the design of networked information technologies within business models reflects and reproduces economic and political power. (130)</p><p>At the core of Cohen's method, then, is a commitment to analyzing the reproduction of power. (131) Law, ideologies, and technical constraints work together to map and remap power. The book's opening undersells the real value of Cohen's project, though. It lies not in these basic methodological points, which have been made before, but in her analysis of how law, technology, and ideas have worked together to generate growing power for those in command of the informational economy.</p><p>Cohen's object of study is \"informational capitalism.\" (132) Capitalism, here, '\"is oriented toward profit-maximizing, that is, toward increasing the amount of surplus appropriated by capital on the basis of the private control over the means of production and circulation,' while informationalism 'is oriented .. . toward the accumulation of knowledge and towards higher levels of complexity in information processing.'\" (133) She advocates for this organizing concept over narrower formulations such as surveillance capitalism because it trains our focus on \"the underlying transformative importance of the sociotechnical shift to informationalism as a mode of development.\" (134) She owes the formulation to Manuel Castells and his influential book, The Rise of the Network Society. (135) How much surplus the capitalist mode of production produces, Castells argues, depends on productivity levels, which in turn respond to \"modes of development\"--meaning \"the technological arrangements through which labor works on matter.\" (136) In different eras, different modes of development have prevailed: in the agricultural era, most important was the use of land and labor. (137) In the industrial era, productivity gains were centrally keyed to the uses and distribution of new energy sources. (138) In our informational mode of development, \"the source of productivity lies in the technology of knowledge generation, information processing, and symbol communication.\" (139) It is thus \"the action of knowledge upon knowledge itself [that is] the main source of productivity.\" (140)</p><p>Today, a country's productivity and place in the global economy relate centrally to its ability to produce and process knowledge, information, and data. (141) Via a detailed empirical analysis of the rise and fall of different sectors in the global economy, Castells shows that in the world's core economies, the service sector has taken preeminence over manufacturing, and an increasing percentage of jobs can be defined as involving \"information processing.\" (142) Examples include software programming, advertising, healthcare, and finance. (143) Even manufacturing has become more information-intensive, as techniques such as just-in-time production and branding become key determinants of profitability among leading firms. (144)</p><p>Cohen's account builds on Castells's, beginning with three overarching structural shifts that she argues enabled the transition to an informational economy: the enclosure of intangible resources, the \"datafication of the basic factors of industrial production,\" and the embedding of patterns of exchange within \"information platforms.\" (145) As law evolved to create more property or propertylike protection for information, information became an increasingly viable and valuable form of capital. Finance was \"datafied\" or \"dematerialized\" as technologies and law coevolved to enable instantaneous transactions in global markets, exotic forms of securitization, and demonetization (or the increasing reliance on cashless payment systems and now cryptocurrencies). (146) Labor, another key factor of production, also became \"datafied\" via platforms like TaskRabbit and Uber that fragment the workplace, and by the use of digital networks to infor-mationalize, deterritorialize, and fissure production. (147) Even the value and workings of land as a resource were altered by informational dynamics. New information technologies have enabled the emergence of complex instruments such as credit-default swaps and derivatives that are increasingly important to the functioning of land as capital. (148) Such changes turned not just on technology but on law. Complex derivatives, for example, would not have been possible without developments in the 1800s that made it possible to \"own\" debt as an asset (149) and in the late 1900s that loosened recording requirements to make rapid transactions of mortgage liabilities possible. (150)</p><p>Cohen argues that the datafication and reintermediation enabled by information technologies has also fundamentally altered the organizational terrain of informational capitalism, as the locus of barter, exchange, and appropriation is increasingly shifted to \"platforms.\" (151) Platforms are intermediaries organized through the logic of networks that provide \"would-be counterparties with access to one another and techniques for rendering users legible to those seeking to market goods and services to them.\" (152) The Sears Roebuck catalog and Shoprite are old platforms; Google, Amazon, and Uber are new platforms. Digital networks enable a greater role for platforms and for bigger and more centrally organized platforms. Amazon can replace the local bookstore--and then the clothing store, the toy store, and soon, perhaps, the local grocery store. As Cohen points out, platforms can be understood simply as points of \"friction\" in networks--points through which parties must pass and where control can therefore be exerted. Platforms need not be profitable, but they can be. As early platforms like Google took hold, venture capitalists demanded revenues, in turn \"driv[ing] platform design\" toward strategies like data harvesting and behavioral advertising. (153)</p><p>This is the same story told by Zuboff but with a much broader frame of reference. As a result, Cohen's account connects informationalism with the rise of many forms of private power beyond simple \"instrumentarianism.\" Cohen's structural focus on platforms, for example, allows her to trace how these networks (not just Google but also Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb, which receive little attention in Zuboff's account) are reshaping economic exchange. Networks generate network effects: the value of networks increases as more users are added. This creates tendencies toward monopoly that can be exploited because both buyers and sellers become increasingly dependent upon the marketplace of the platform. (154) Platforms are \"two-sided\" markets that serve buyers and sellers both, creating other opportunities for abuse--and making it difficult for traditional tests of market power, such as price-effect inquiries, to get much purchase on these new forms of power. (155)</p><p>As Google's chief economist noted many years ago, in the digital age, if you own the servers through which transactions are occurring (monetized or not), you have enormous power to collect data, craft and extract value from personalization, experiment on users, and enforce new modalities of contracts. (156) We now can see Zuboff's concerns in broader perspective: private control of platforms enables not merely behavioral surplus capture and behavioral modification but a host of other new forms of power subject to abuse. Monopoly power is one, and in our informational age, it has expanded not only in the internet realm but also in ordinary commercial markets. (157) There are also distributive issues: platforms follow \"winner-take-all\" dynamics and enable vast new powers to price discriminate using tailored offers and contract terms. (158) If Amazon can determine who among us is willing to pay more for a new album or audiobook, it can charge us more and extract consumer surplus. There is good reason to think that a significant reason firms are so hungry for data is not to modify behavior but instead to extract as much profit from each consumer as they can. (159)</p><p>C. Neoliberalism and the Construction of Private Power</p><p>Cohen's argument is not simply that law and technology coevolve: it is that both coevolve in interaction with our reigning ideological framework for governance. (160) This framework is \"neoliberalism,\" or the view that \"human well-being can best be advanced by the maximization of entrepreneurial freedoms within an institutional framework characterized by private property rights, individual liberty, unencumbered markets, and free trade.\" (161) Associated with the work of market-fundamentalist economists like F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman, neoliberal thought demands not only that markets be given free rein to govern the economic sphere but also that other domains, including government, be increasingly ordered like a market, \"incorporating and responding to marketized feedback about efficacy and value.\" (162) This reflected an attempt to resolve a contradiction in neoliberal governance foreshadowed by the realists: there was no market that did not rely on government. To protect efficiency, then, law and regulation themselves had to be \"infus[ed] ... with a competitive and capitalist ethos.\" (163)</p><p>Neoliberalism became the idiom of governance in the 1980s and 1990s in Europe, the United States, and beyond, underlying the antiregulatory, antilabor, anti-welfare-state, and market-mimicking policy approaches of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and the \"Washington Consensus.\" (164) It also deeply shaped the approaches offered by \"third-way\" liberals like Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, evidenced in commitments to welfare state retrenchment and a corporate-oriented model of trade liberalization. (165)</p><p>Cohen is particularly attuned to how this mode of thought affected the regulatory state: it ushered in regulatory approaches that are \"procedurally informal,\" standards-based, \"mediated by expert professional and technical networks,\" and \"increasingly financialized.\" (166) Intended to introduce flexibility and speed into the regulatory process, these changes also made processes more opaque and proliferated \"new points of entry for economic power.\" (167) They tended to assume markets were characterized by healthy competition and that the value of regulation could be measured through market-denominated cost-benefit analysis. (168) The increasing information intensity in industry and commerce today creates vast and undeniable challenges for regulators. How do you detect discrimination, manipulative marketing, or regulatory evasion when so much is buried in intricate decisions made by data-gatherers, software, and hardware? (169) The \"paranoid style\" in regulatory reform (170) has not helped matters: it has downplayed concerns about private power and focused obsessively on state coercion--failing to recognize the threats that private power can create and the central role that regulators have played in the emergence of robust modern informational industries. (171)</p><p>Also key to the rise of informational power in the economy, Cohen argues, were two other logics that have quintessentially neoliberal features: one that celebrates and naturalizes \"innovation\" and the other that analogizes between information and \"speech.\" (172) Both work to immunize platforms and other information-intensive firms from regulation.</p><p>Why insulate the information economy and its most advanced and powerful firms from the reach of regulators? It does not do today to argue that market freedom is ordained by God or nature. Instead, new justifications for market insulation have emerged. One is the valorization of \"innovation\" as an \"autonomous and inevitably beneficial process that is the natural result of human liberty\" and that is incompatible with regulation. (173) As Cohen describes, industry, along with right-wing think tanks and blogs, furthered this narrative, which has had a powerful impact on legal discourse. (174) As many in the field of science studies and the history of science have shown, technological development is not autonomous. (175) Innovation is also not risk-free or inevitably beneficial. (176) But the fetish for innovation in contemporary policy and legal thought has had enormous power, and it has helped forestall regulatory adaptations to address systemic threats associated with informational infrastructures. (177) It has also propelled stronger exclusionary rules. If innovation is prioritized in itself, then perfectly coherent statements from the perspective of welfare economics or fairness that might support weaker intellectual property can be ignored. Take, for example, the argument that strong, exclusive intellectual property rights do harm because the gains associated with the incentivized innovations are less than the losses imposed by price increases on goods that would have been created anyway. (178) Antiregulatory claims were also advanced via an analogy between data and \"speech\" that courts have embraced. (179) As Cohen notes, industry and think tanks have promoted these ideas, and they have been successfully mobilized to serve forms of intermediary immunity. (180)</p><p>Cohen also gestures, subtly, to another critical fact: arguments coming from \"copyleft\" scholars and other progressives skeptical of strong intellectual-property law and who celebrated \"peer-to-peer\" production helped further some of these same ideas, though with no intention to bolster the corporate power that has benefitted from them (in fact quite the opposite). Some of the most influential voices valorizing and naturalizing innovation were left-libertarian tech Utopians. Eben Moglen, a law professor at Columbia and an important theorist of free software, famously insisted that human creativity, like electrons, simply flowed anytime people were connected in networks. (181) It reflected a broader move at the time by many like Moglen: they hailed the creative potential unleashed by innovation and pivoted to a demand for simple openness, because at the time the most important obstacle to creativity and flourishing to many appeared to be overly restrictive intellectual-property law.</p><p>As Yochai Benkler described it recently, the most ambitious version of this argument suggested that \"winning political battles over free software or open source hardware could make people better able to live independent lives than winning political battles over labor or employment law.\" (182) The dream that open software could free us all and that one could \"hack\" the broader sociopolitical system by demanding openness at a certain technological layer, now seems painfully, obviously wrong. (183) Today, for example, open-source software is fully integrated into Google's Android phones. (184) The volunteer labor of thousands thus helps power Google's surveillance-capitalist machine. As Cohen has pointed out, freedom at one layer in the stack often ends up meaning that control is simply exerted elsewhere, with \"free\" inputs subsumed into a broader apparatus of control. (185)</p><p>One important task for legal scholars of information today, then, is to unpack how demands for \"openness,\" \"sharing,\" and \"freedom\" in the internet age helped enable--or at least did not stand in the way of-- the development of troubling forms of private power. As Cohen describes, the argument for \"commons-based production\" on digital networks proved perfectly compatible with the emergence of platforms, including those like Google that offer much for free. (186) Many of the most powerful advocates for immunizing internet platforms, arguing against any land of property right in data and equating software with speech, were academic theorists hailing the importance of the public domain and cultures of sharing. (187) Nonprofit groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) also argued vigorously for a free internet and free coding in the same spirit--translating these into demands for First Amendment protection for software and the rejection of regulation of internet intermediaries, that over time proved to be remarkably consistent with what Google also wanted. (188)</p><p>Simple arguments for \"freedom\" made possible by an unregulated internet seem naive today, given the manipulation, extremism, and harassment that have flourished there. (189) I say this not to assign blame, for I, like Cohen, traveled in these same circles and at times trafficked in the same language. (190) Even at the time, though, some of us worried about its entailments. Almost ten years ago, I described a series of questions that I believed we, as advocates of open access, the commons, and the public domain, had to answer. Was the freedom we demanded in simple opposition to control, or were control and freedom \"instead intimately interconnected and interdependent in the age of digital networks?\" (191) Could we call the internet \"free\" if it lacked formal constraints on participation, or did we need a more affirmative vision of participation and access that addressed the deep, prevailing subordinations of our time? (192) What was our relationship to markets--did we want spaces free from markets or free for markets, and could the same domain be both? (193) Could advocates for access and openness \"build a theory of freedom... based upon the radical political possibilities of the immaterial while also accounting for the crucial moment when the informational intersects with the material in the places that we create and communicate, that we live and die?\" (194)</p><p>These questions still resonate today. As Cohen hints, some of what was claimed in the name of a more democratic internet likely helped facilitate the ferocious new form of private power that dominates it today. How exactly did this work, and could it have been otherwise? Perhaps this is just a refrain of an old story: powerful actors can appropriate liberatory language for their own aims because legal doctrines and abstract arguments are malleable. (195) I suspect that there is more at stake in the example, however, particularly for those interested in building a more democratic political economy--lessons, perhaps, about the limits of \"hacks\" to the property system in the absence of more transformative changes to our market society; about the need to more deeply theorize the relationships we envision among freedom, markets, the state, and society; and about the importance of incorporating not only an analytic of power but of market society and capitalism, that is sensitive to how spaces that in one register appear free and neutral nonetheless can be primed to reproduce the hierarchies of old. (196)</p><p>III. THE LAW OF INFORMATIONAL CAPITALISM</p><p>How do firms engaged in modes of informational extraction of surplus use the law to fortify their control? Cohen's account helps point us to some of the key elements but requires some clarification and development, particularly to illuminate the ways that law has helped not just to create private power but to insulate it from popular control. But the end result is a profoundly important correction to legal scholarship to date, which has made it hard to see the legal substrates of private power in this domain--for example, because data is not property. (197) Cohen is not operating alone, of course. Many others are also mapping how law helps to construct private power in the political economy: scholars like Frank Pasquale, (198) Yochai Benkler, (199) Lina Khan, (200) K. Sabeel Rahman, (201) Anupam Chander, (202) Veena Dubai, (203) Brishen Rogers, (204) and Elizabeth Joh. (205) Cohen's account, though, is the most panoptic that we have, and the most useful tool so far to construct an accurate picture of the role of law in the creation and extension of new forms of private power in the digital age. Below, I aim to do this, pulling from Cohen and others a set of insights about how law constructs informational capitalism and later showing how law works to insulate the market order it has constructed from democratic reorganization.</p><p>A. How Law Empowers Informational Capitalists</p><p>What role does law itself play in constituting the \"capital\" of informational capitalism? Data alone, after all, is not capital. A deeper point is at stake here. You cannot wade far into the literature on our data-intensive age without encountering the pervasive metaphor of data as \"the new oil.\" But as Jathan Sodowski recently pointed out, \"Data is not out there waiting to be discovered . .. like crude oil and raw ore. Data is a recorded abstraction of the world created and valorised by people using technology\" (206) To exist as data, an input must be put into a schema, sensed or processed in some fashion. Much like the proverbial fallen tree in the forest, neither a drop of water nor a wish can be \"data\" until it is perceived and processed. Data is a social product, one that can be transformed into a commodity but that does not exist in the world without us, waiting for collection and exchange. Control over data and its production is socially and also legally determined.</p><p>The tendency instead to see data as a thing that springs from a person and that enters the world as a transcendent object misapprehends what data is and obscures how it came to serve as a critical form of capital in the current age. (207) This view of data--rather like the view of commodities of which Marx once wrote--imbues it with a land of religious aura, treating \"productions of the human brain\" as if they are \"autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own, which enter into relations both with each other and with the human race.\" (208) If we are to intervene to democratize private power today, we must instead understand data (and by extension, information and knowledge) as the product of social relations and so properly the object of social interest. And we must understand how law helps to construct data, and data as capital, by shaping these social relations.</p><p>Where do information capitalists get their power? One source, as Cohen notes, is immaterial property rights. The \"grandest\" among these, patent and copyright, emerged over the last few centuries but were notably strengthened and expanded in recent decades. (209) In a superbly subtle account, Cohen draws attention to the myriad changes--beyond simple expansion of scope or term -that helped facilitate the industrial organization of scientific and artistic production.</p><p>For example, U.S. law shifted to allow corporations to own patents and copyrights, to control their employees' creations, and to claim follow-on or derivative creations and innovations as new forms of property. (210) The purported aim of these laws also shifted over time from the advancement of learning and the arts, which gave significant priority to the diffusion of knowledge, to an emphasis on innovation incentives, which prioritized the perspective of producers. (211)</p><p>Trademark law creates key assets for the informational economy as well, anchoring processes of branding and advertising. This area of law also expanded in the 1990s, moving beyond the protection of consumers from confusion to create a more robust and property-like entitlement to the goodwill associated with a brand, especially for famous marks. (212) The Chicago School made its mark here too, theorizing that trademarks did not just protect from confusion but minimized \"search costs,\" a rationale that enabled companies to claim far more capacious rights in marks. (213) Other economic theories redescribed corporate marketing and branding activities not as unsavory or wasteful attempts at mind control but as signals of \"quality,\" reasoning that only well-capitalized firms could afford to invest in their brands. (214) Law changed to relax restrictions on \"naked licensing\" of trademarks, enabling forms of franchising that permitted corporations like McDonald's to formally disavow employee relationships with hundreds of thousands of people whose work they intricately controlled. (215) This enabled the creation of the informational service sector, where franchisors could both exert networked control over franchisees and avoid the strictures of labor law. (216)</p><p>Many of the most intensely informational industries rely heavily on these forms of intellectual property. The pharmaceutical industry and Hollywood are perhaps the leading examples. But traditional forms of intellectual property are only a small part of the story for powerhouse platforms like Google, Facebook, Uber, and Airbnb. (217) Trademark law is omnipresent in commercial settings, and internet companies do take out patents: Google secured one on PageRank and Amazon famously on \"one-click\" shopping. (218) But the most critical technological inputs and outputs of the data-driven algorithmic age are unowned, if ownership means exclusive rights that carry a \"good-against-the-world\" quality.</p><p>Algorithms and machine learning are hard to protect with patent law, for example. Algorithms per se are excluded subject matter, (219) and machine-learning techniques are arguably discovering patterns in nature that cannot be propertized. (220) Nor are these techniques readily protectable via copyright. They may be protectable by trade-secret law, but trade secrecy is a right that arguably more resembles tort or contract than exclusive property. (221)</p><p>Data is the other central resource in the age of algorithms and machine learning, and it is famously unowned in intellectual-property terms. Copyright law does not cover facts, and databases can only be protected in very narrow circumstances. (222) Intellectual-property scholars have, for the most part, argued vociferously against any form of property protection in personal data for a variety of reasons, including concerns about transaction costs and innovation. (223)</p><p>What are the primary sources of economic power for Google, Facebook, the algorithmic financial sector, and the projected new data overlords that will revolutionize medical care, the criminal-justice system, education, and more? Two key sources are trade-secret rights and contract law. (224) Trade-secrecy law has long been a backwater in intellectual-property scholarship. It is still largely governed by state law, and few scholars focus on it. Contract law has often been discounted as a source of power over information because it generally does not bind third parties. (225) Both, however, are key modalities of the protection of data and informational techniques. As Cohen describes, \" [r]ealizing the profit potential of commercial surveillance activity requires practices that mark data flows with indicia of ownership. \" (226) That phrase--the \"indicia of ownership\"--is well chosen: what matters to the construction of power is not the legal category but its practical effect. Contracts, for example, can create property-like rights if the group of relevant parties is small enough to contract with. (227)</p><p>As Cohen notes, \" [p] articipants in data-intensive industries, including both platforms and data brokers, routinely deploy trade-secrecy law and contract to achieve a measure of exclusive control over the data that they collect.\" (228) How do they deploy these weaker legal forms to exact control? They begin with a technical advantage: the operations of the big information intermediaries and the new disrupters of the service economy are rarely visible to outsiders who are not granted permission. The techniques that give them competitive advantages, whether in ranking web pages, serving ads, or identifying tumors, are unlikely to be as well-documented as, say, the chemical formulation of a new medicine, or the \"formula\" for a Hollywood blockbuster. Being an Uber driver or a rider gives you few insights into the precise ways in which Uber's algorithms operate. Reverse engineering these insights--and even understanding their basis--is difficult and costly, where it is not impossible.</p><p>Contractual and trade-secrecy claims work in conjunction with firms' technical control over the network. (229) Platforms can deploy contracts with their vendors, customers, and collaborators that require data and algorithms to be kept secret or not shared because they inhabit privileged technical positions at the nodes of networks that millions of people want to access. (230) These contracts deny users control over their data or any access to the companies' valuable secrets. They are \"boilerplates\" that cannot in practice be amended by users, making them a \"powerful tool both for private ordering of behavior and for private reordering of even the most bedrock legal rights and obligations.\" (231) Some firms use terms-of-use agreements that also forbid users from undertaking research that might disclose aspects of their platform's functioning. (232) The impact of these contracts is dramatically amplified by overbroad laws like the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which render certain violations of such terms-of-use agreements criminal. (233)</p><p>Although Cohen does not discuss it, changes in contract and trade-secrecy law were essential to platforms' ability to anchor this new power. Without changes in the law of contracts that blessed digital \"click-wrap\" agreements, platform power could not have evolved as it has. (234) The subject matter of trade-secret law has also expanded dramatically over the decades, from a narrow tort-based right to prevent competitors from stealing formulas and employees to an expansive property-like right to any valuable and secret commercial information. No one has yet written a full history of these developments that situates them in the rise of incentive-based accounts of IP and corporate efforts to expand their protection over data. But evidence of key inflection points can be found in the expansions in the types of information protectable as trade secrets: from the early 1939 Restatement (First) of Torts definition of trade secrets, to the notably broader definitions in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act of 1979 and the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition of 1995, (235) and then to the federalization of trade-secrets law in the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. (236)</p><p>Through the interaction of these various background entitlements, platforms today enjoy rights to seize data flows. Google and Facebook--but also apps, smart appliances, medical intermediaries, and so forth--occupy particularly powerful nodes in networks that permit them to harvest data in a manner that others cannot. Does that mean that this is a \"lawless\" domain? Hardly. Since at least the time of Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, it has been understood that a regime that permits first-comers to seize an asset is also a regime of law. (237) The coding of data as free for the gathering is just as much a rule of law as a property regime in data would be. Cohen likens this regime to the legal construction of the public domain--a place defined by the \"absence of prior claims to the resource in question.\" (238) She also notes that the public-domain treatment of data works alongside other legal rules that protect platforms (contract law, intermediary immunity, and the like), making the conventional refrain of intellectual-property scholars that there is no property in data formally true but practically false. (239)</p><p>With this in mind, we can return to cases like Moore v. Regents of California, typically only discussed in property or health-law contexts, and reread them as canonical cases shaping the information economy. (240) John Moore was a patient under treatment for hairy-cell leukemia at the UCLA Medical Center whose cells were harvested--unbeknownst to him--as part of a surgery to which he consented. (241) The cells were turned into a cell line, which was then patented as a means to produce certain proteins potentially worth billions of dollars as treatments. (242) Moore argued that the cells were his property and had been taken from him in violation of the tort of conversion. (243) The tort, which as the court wryly noted, evolved to \"determine whether the loser or finder of a horse had the better title,\" might have covered Moore's cells, had he been understood to have \"possessory or ownership\" interests in them. (244) And what could be more one's own than one's cells? People in California have a property-like right to the far less tangible interest in their own likenesses, under the \"publicity\" tort, Moore argued. (245) Why give him the right to control his likeness but not his body? Noting that Moore did have the right to refuse or accept treatment and to be appropriately informed by interests that might have impacted the doctor's medical judgment, the court dismissed any autonomy interests he might have had and treated the central question of the case as one about the viability of industrial biotechnology. (246) Scientific research might be impeded if researchers or companies had uncertain title over cells and the patents that derived from them. (247) Moore's argument, the court concluded, \"threatens to destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical research.\" (248) It was a logic of \"productive appropriation\" that decided the question, as Cohen points out. (249)</p><p>Cohen gestures toward something that the scholarly literature has failed to reckon with: Moore was not an \"anti-commodification opinion\" as sometimes described. (250) Rather, it favored corporate extraction and accumulation over an individual entitlement to transact for ones' valuable cells and data. Were the arguments in favor of research indeed sufficiently compelling to override any claim Moore might have had? As a dissenting justice noted, the conversion tort is flexible, and it might have been interpreted to exclude actions against unknowing third-party researchers (or anyone not aware of the value of cells who extracted them for that reason without notice, as Moore's doctors allegedly were) . (251) Damages awards also could have been adjusted to address the equities of each parties' contributions. (252) What decided the matter for the majority was less the necessary implications for health research than the power of the innovation narrative and an incomprehension of the distributive claim at the heart of Moore's case. (253)</p><p>Though Cohen does not discuss it, Moore should be read alongside cases where individuals were denied the recourse of tort law when seeking to exert control over how their personal data was used. Consider Nader v. General Motors Corp., an influential case holding that the privacy tort of intrusion upon seclusion is not implicated by the gathering of public data about an individual. (254) Cases like these, too, are key building blocks of the public domain of personal data. They \"legitimate [] a pattern of appropriation by some, with economic and political consequences for others. \" (255)</p><p>We can cull from Cohen's account a raft of other laws and policy choices that also helped to shape the freedom of platform and informational appropriation. The Federal Trade Commission enabled personal-data capture by deciding to apply only a thin conception of \"unfair trade practices\" that authorized data harvesting wherever notice and contractual consent could be shown. (256) The fact that a privacy statement ran into the thousands of pages made no difference. (257) Consent, though, is an impossible rubric through which to justify these practices. As Cohen notes, in the age of the sensing net and the internet of things, we have no idea really what data is being collected, what it might mean to those who deploy it, nor what will be done with it. (258)</p><p>Changes in antitrust law in the 1980s and 1990s were important because they narrowed the field's focus to price effects, making the power of platforms hard to see and challenge. (259) The power of platforms was also enhanced by internet intermediary law and the lack of meaningful consequences for data or other security breaches that threaten users. (260) These forms of immunity have broad consequences, but it is worth noting that there are other, more specific immunities that are critical to the emergence of data extraction and processing models in each industry. For example, there is now a vast market in the sale and processing of electronic health records. (261) Healthcare is an area unusually well protected by privacy laws. But the reigning federal statute, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), (262) imposes no restrictions on the disclosure or exchange of so-called \"de-identified\" data, which does not provide a \"reasonable basis\" for identifying an individual. (263) As long as identifying information is redacted, holders of these valuable records can exchange them as they wish--unbeknownst to the individuals whose data comprises the records, or to the health professionals whose labor creates the records.</p><p>B. The Encasement of Informational Capitalism</p><p>By extracting and building on Cohen's account, we can begin to see how law constructs private economic power in the informational age. But the picture is incomplete: legal ordering is being used not simply to help generate and sustain private power but to insulate it from democratic control. A key feature of the juridical construct of capitalism, as described above, is the insulation of the market from political control. In the early modern era, this meant creating and then con-stitutionalizing private property rights. In the neoliberal era, the \"encasement\" of markets from democratic control has taken on new forms, as Quinn Slobodian's excellent recent book describes. (264) The Geneva School neoliberals, in particular, sought not markets freed from the state but markets protected by the state from popular interference. The World Trade Organization (WTO) and other trade pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were shaped to deliver precisely this land of containment of democratic control: they place the rights of parties such as intellectual property holders or foreign investors beyond the reach of local democratic control, in order to reward foreign investment and protect market access. (265)</p><p>Three legal moves are critical to understanding how private economic power over informational regimes is insulated from democratic control today, and none receives much attention in Cohen's account. (266) First, in a case called Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., the Supreme Court held that trade secrets constituted property that could be protected by the Takings Clause, (267) and that compensation could be required if there was also interference with \"investment-backed expectations.\" (268) Precisely what would constitute such interference was left unclear--the Court merely concluded that where data was covered by state trade-secret law and made public after the government expressly promised to keep it secret, compensation was due. (269) Lower courts, however, have read the decision more broadly. One shows the radical implications that could follow if trade secrets are treated broadly as property subject to the Fifth Amendment: in Philip Morris, Inc. v. Reilly, the First Circuit struck down a Massachusetts law that required disclosure of all cigarette ingredients to state regulators, who were then empowered, if they found that public health could benefit, to make them public. (270) The court dismissed the idea that the state's public-health interest in disclosure justified the move without compensation, holding that \"the fact that the public interest can sometimes override private property interests does not establish that the tobacco companies have no cognizable property interest when a state decides that publication of their trade secrets will further public health.\" (271) Rather, the public-health benefits were but one consideration in the takings analysis and were here deemed insufficiently weighty to overcome tobacco companies' investment-backed expectations in secrecy. (272)</p><p>On this theory, trade-secrets law stands as a profound impediment to democracy. Trade secrecy's subject matter is vast: it can encompass any land of information or data held by a private actor as long as it has \"independent economic value\" derived from its secrecy, is not \"readily ascertainable by proper means,\" and is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. (273) In the wake of these takings decisions, companies have begun to argue that a wide range of laws that seek to disclose corporate information would violate takings law. They have argued against proposals to disclose the chemicals being injected into groundwater in hydraulic fracking, the workings of voting machines, and the prices of medicines, for example. (274) Companies like Google, Facebook, and Palantir will surely argue that their data, algorithms, and processing techniques used by companies qualify as trade secrets, meaning that any attempt to render them public, or to give access to competitors, will likely face a constitutional challenge.</p><p>Recent Supreme Court cases have also reshaped the First Amendment, giving firms a powerful new tool to strike down legislation that seeks to govern how they buy and sell data, fund candidates for office, and commercialize their products. (275) A series of software cases show the stakes for regulation in an age of informational capitalism, as courts have been persuaded that software is \"speech\" for the purposes of the First Amendment. In one, a website sued Google for tortious interference, alleging that Google had maliciously demoted it in search rankings. (276) The court sided with Google, judging its rankings to be corporate \"opinions\" entitled to First Amendment protection. (277) Google has invested heavily in the argument that the results of its searches are Google's own speech, funding academics to write papers on the topic and making the point regularly in court. (278) When the FBI ordered Apple to assist it in breaking into a suspect's iPhone after a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Apple mounted a First Amendment defense, arguing that requiring it to write code and \"sign\" it \"cryptographically... using its own proprietary encryption methods . .. amounts to compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment.\" (279) Courts have concluded that software itself is \"speech\" subject to First Amendment protection, (280) and have applied intermediate scrutiny to laws that regulate computer code. (281)</p><p>Absurd results follow if we treat all code as speech protected by the Constitution. Volkswagen would have a constitutional argument if it were asked to write a patch to fix the diesel models it designed surreptitiously to exceed emissions limits. Medical-device companies would be able to argue that the state had to overcome First Amendment scrutiny before requiring security measures to prevent hacking of implanted digital devices. The risk is not hypothetical. When the State Department recently sought to restrict the distribution of CAD files for 3D-printed machine-gun parts, the company (Defense Distributed) argued in court that its free speech rights were being violated. (282) Though the case was mooted before it was resolved, the court seemed to countenance the argument. (283) The First Amendment has, remarkably, become a powerful constitutional weapon against the regulation of software and data.</p><p>The basic move is on shaky constitutional ground. It has never been the case that everything that qualifies as \"speech\" in the colloquial sense has been entitled to the protection of the First Amendment. (284) We do not treat the rules of evidence, or doctors' advice to patients, or lawyers' advice to clients as constitutionally protected speech. (285) Whether something is speech turns on whether it furthers the core purpose of the First Amendment: to enable us to be, and experience ourselves as, authors of our own government. (286) The notion that software as such should be protected by the First Amendment has little to recommend it, once we understand this. A program that operates antilock brakes has nothing to do with the formation of public opinion. Google's search rankings are a closer case, but search engines are fundamentally about delivering users what they are looking for. (287) This makes implausible the claim that Google is the speaker that needs protecting. As a modality to encase the power of informational capitalists from democratic authority, however, the doctrine works very well.</p><p>International law provides another means of encasement. At its inception, the WTO bound its members--today almost all countries in the world--to adopt strong intellectual property rights. (288) Member countries were required, for example, to provide a minimum of twenty years of protection for patents, (289) and to allow patents on technologies like medicines and food, which many countries did not do at the time. (290) They were required to permit copyrights on software, and to protect \"compilations of data\" where these were \"intellectual creations.\" (291) These commitments were thrust into the trading regime by the concerted efforts of a relatively small group of informational industries based in the United States and Europe--drug companies, Hollywood, publishers, and the like. (292) They are written in a manner that gives states no general discretion to adapt their laws to meet democratic demands for public health or security. (293) And while the agreement has \"flexibilities,\" they are difficult to use in practice. (294) In the early 1990s, when the WTO's intellectual property agreement was drafted, the first web browser had just been created, and Google and Facebook were still years in the future. As informational capital and data have grown in value, multinational firms have pressed for and received stronger rights in new international agreements. (295) Google has lobbied vigorously for new commitments in international law, for example for establishing a \"presumption that governments may not restrict online information flows\" and forbidding countries from adopting data-localization rules. (296) Recent trade agreements have included new commitments of this sort, constricting the options that national governments have to regulate. (297) These provisions have significant implications for the adjudication of public interests. For example, many countries, including Canada, have required that companies store certain sensitive data (such as health information) on local servers, so that local law can more readily be applied-- but such provisions are forbidden in the revised NAFTA text. (298) Investor protections included in many trade agreements have also been used by information-intensive firms to contest local interpretations of intellectual property law, as in a 2017 NAFTA case in Canada where the drug company Eli Lilly sought to overturn the Canadian Supreme Court's interpretation of its patent law because it undermined the company's profit expectations. (299) Data flows have not yet been the subject of claims under such treaty provisions but, as Cohen points out, cases making such claims are likely only a matter of time. (300)</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>We live today in a rapidly changing age of platforms, algorithmic power, and informational capitalism. Zuboff's book forcefully and convincingly shows one result: a new land of business enterprise, oriented to extract massive amounts of data, with the ability to analyze and experiment upon us at such a grand scale that it makes dramatic new modalities of behavioral control thinkable. The existing evidence casts doubt on Zuboff's claim that surveillance capitalist firms in fact can program us for profit. More problematically, her account screens from view some of the most important stakes of the new forms of power being enabled by contemporary data gathering and processing techniques.</p><p>Cohen's book provides a better view of the dynamics of the \"informational\" mode of development that underlies new or intensifying forms of private and public power. As Cohen shows, it is the law and political economy of the informational age that we must study if we are to understand and shape this new form of power. Private power in the informational economy has not been produced by \"lawlessness.\" Instead, under the influence of a historical paradigm of thought that has centered efficiency as a goal and treated market supremacy and innovation as unquestionable goods, a wave has rippled through our law. The law of intellectual property and trade secrets, of internet immunity and free speech, and of trade and contracts morphed to enable the capture of information and data as corporate capital, and to allow their deployment to extract surplus in new ways. Our legal order, intertwined with the architecture of digital networks, has enabled the creation of vast new firms that wield new forms of surveillance and algorithmic power, but it also has delivered us a form of neoliberal capitalism that is inclined toward monopoly, concentrated power, and inequality. Most troubling are the developments in takings law, free speech law, and free trade law that are working to insulate growing private economic and surveillance power from democratic control.</p><p>Can public power sufficient to govern this private power be built? With what laws, ideas, and technologies? Questions of data and democracy, not just data and dignity, must be at the core of our concern today and are among the most important questions of our time, for reasons both books amply show. Cohen's account suggests, importantly, that there will be no magic bullet. Just as there is no single law that constructs private power in the digital age, there will be no single law to democratize it. Data is not oil but a product of social and legal creation. As Cohen and Zuboff show, it is a product of ours that is also remaking us. It is time now that we return the favor.</p><p>AUTHOR. Professor of Law, Yale Law School.

See BENKLERETAL., supra note 8, at 276-79. The most significant study purporting to show a positive effect of behavioral advertising showed that the effect size on behavior (in that study, for instance, purchasing after clicking through an ad) was very small. Id. at 277 (reporting results of S.C. Matz et al., Psychological Targeting as an Effective Approach to Digital Mass Persuasion, 114 PROC. NAT'L ACAD. SCI. U.S.A. 12714, 12715-16 (2017)). For example, for about every 7,700 people targeted, only one additional purchase was achieved. Id. In an election, even if every voter could be targeted, effects of this size would impact \"a few hundred voters across an entire state.\" BENKLERET AL., supra note 8, at 278. Recent assessments suggest that even these small effect sizes may be overestimates, given certain methodological complexities. See, e.g., Dean Eckles, Brett R. Gordon &amp; Garrett A. Johnson, Field Studies of Psychologically Targeted Ads Face Threats to Internal Validity, 115 PROC. NAT'L ACAD. SCI. U.SA. E5254, E5254 (2018) (highlighting limitations of the experimental methodology used, including that it did not randomize subjects to different ads and so may have been picking up confounders, such as differences in age or gender correlated with the personality types they were keyed to); Byron Sharp, Nick Danenberg &amp; Steven Bellman, Psychological Targeting, 115 PROC. NAT'L ACAD. SCI. U.S.A. E7890, E7890 (2018) (noting that the Matz study showed positive results in only two of the five experiments, and did not control for the differing creative quality of advertisements, and suggesting that the impact of the psychologically targeted advertisement was the result of \"the creative quality of these ads... not their targeting\"). Companies spend substantial sums on online marketing, of course, and this might count as evidence that it has an impact.

The Restatement (First) of Torts defined a \"trade secret\" as any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one's business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. It may be a formula for a chemical compound, a process of manufacturing, treating or preserving materials, a pattern for a machine or other device, or a list of customers.</p><p>RESTATEMENT (FIRST) OF TORTS [section] 757 cmt. b (AM. LAW INST. 1939). It also specified that a \"trade secret is a process or device for continuous use in the operation of the business.\" Id. The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) adopted a notably broader definition of scope:</p><p>\"Trade secret\" means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process that: (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.</p><p>UNIF. TRADE SECRETS ACT [section] 1(4) (1985). For example, it deliberately broadened the definition of trade secrets by removing a \"continuous use\" requirement in the Restatement, protecting even \"single-event\" information and protecting \"negative information that has commercial value,\" such as the results of lengthy and expensive research which prove that a certain process will not work. See MELVIN F. JAGER, TRADE SECRETS LAW [section] 3:34 (2019). The Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition sought to integrate the UTSA and notes that</p><p>[a] trade secret can consist of a formula, pattern, compilation of data, computer program, device, method, technique, process, or other form or embodiment of economically valuable information. A trade secret can relate to technical matters such as the composition or design of a product, a method of manufacture, or the know-how necessary to perform a particular operation or service. A trade secret can also relate to other aspects of business operations such as pricing and marketing techniques or the identity and requirements of customers ....</p><p>RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION [section] 39 cmt. d (AM. LAW INST. 1995). Trade secrets were deleted from the Restatement (Second) of Torts because the ALI no longer considered trade secrets a branch of tort law. See Ramon A. Klitzke, The Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 64 MARQ. L. REV. 277, 283 (1980). The topic was instead included by the ALI in the Third Restatement of Unfair Competition.

However, markets arise out of and operate through law--not just through public regulation but also through private law regimes (in property, contract, and tort) that create entitlements, enforce market exchanges, and limit expropriation. Appreciating the significance of law as the infrastructure of markets reveals that no particular market structure is inevitable. Instead, every market order is the result of a complex set of legal and political choices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This Issue of Law and Contemporary Problems investigates the legal foundations of market orders. In this Foreword, we rely upon the Articles that follow to offer an intellectual roadmap for a legally-informed study of the market. These rich and thought-provoking Articles underscore the fundamental role of law in the constitution of markets, as well as the options, limits, dangers, and responsibilities that the legal construction of markets entails.</p><p>One lesson that we take from these writings is that the market can be thought of as a thick ethical concept that can be understood only by combing facts and norms, which cannot be prised apart without doing damage to both. This means that different forms of the market in fact instantiate differing normative visions of the market. To flesh out and generalize these evaluative aspects, we conclude in Part VI with a sketch of three competing visions: efficient markets, democratic markets, and liberal markets. We acknowledge that real markets are imperfect instantiations, and at times hybrids, of these ideal-types. In addition, the types may be further divided, oftentimes with crucial distinctions among their rival variants. But for purposes of this Foreword, our goal is modest: we have no ambition to offer a complete taxonomy of market orders or to resolve the debate over the market's normative foundations. We hope only to bring home our conclusion that any adequate inquiry into the market must take this normative debate into account.</p><p>II MARKETS AND LAW</p><p>The markets that saturate modern life come in various forms: in goods and in services, domestic and transnational, off-line and on-line. Their pervasive presence produces two understandable but unfortunate effects on discourse, both public and academic. First, at times the discourse sounds as if markets are simply part of our natural environment, a brute given of the human condition, like our need for air to breathe. Second, even where no such naturalization takes hold, another form of reification often arises: a presupposition that \"the market\" necessarily follows one form that, at its core, possesses a given set of necessary and sufficient features. Both champions and critics tend to celebrate or criticize the market, implying that we all know what this means and that it necessarily means that one thing.</p><p>The notion of \"intervention in the market\" vividly manifests both tendencies. Intervention may have both negative and positive connotations. So-called market fundamentalists typically emphasize the negative: they tend to perceive any rule or regulation intended to affect the existing operations of a given market as a priori suspect, either because it artificially meddles with the market's operations or because it might distort the market's natural, and by extension beneficial, tendencies. Market skeptics, on the other hand, apply an almost mirror-image presumption against markets, treating the market as a wild force against which we should guard.</p><p>Because markets are powerful institutions that significantly impact individuals, affect relationships, and shape societies, their design should be carefully scrutinized. And because markets are the creation of human societies, and the shape of any market depends heavily on the legal rules that guide nearly every step in market actors' behavior, this scrutiny must be particularized. Lawyers and legal scholars ought to be especially attentive to particulars in framing and evaluating these legal rules. A proposed new rule for the law of the market may be troublesome or it may be desirable, but the idea that any new rule intervenes (for better or for worse) in the market makes no sense. Instead, markets necessarily depend on well-designed and well-enforced rules of the game: they rely on, and are constituted by, a legal infrastructure.</p><p>Markets, in other words, are at least in part legal constructs. And the law influences their construction. Evaluating the merits of any proposed legal reform in this space necessarily relies on particular normative conceptions of the good that markets, or the particular market in question, might supply. But the fact that a given rule or doctrine is (or is not, or is not yet) part of the law of the market does not make it more (or less) interventionist, because the existing rules of a given market do not epitomize the necessary configuration of the market. The status quo, being itself a legal construct, cannot serve as a baseline against which to measure legal intervention.</p><p>Markets are varied, and talking of the market counterproductively essentializes or reifies the status quo. But this should not be taken to suggest that analysis of markets' principal features is a pointless exercise. While variations are crucial, markets typically revolve around certain basic features worth emphasizing. Markets are complicated \"social and institutional arrangements through which goods [and services] are regularly produced for, distributed by and subject to contractual forms of exchange in which money and property rights over goods [or rights to services] are transferred between agents.\" (1) Markets are robust infrastructures that enable systemic, repeatable acts of exchange, and especially exchange among strangers. Smoothly functioning markets rely on defined and respected property rights and rest on the idea that contracts should be honored and, if necessary, enforced. Moreover, while some types of trade--ranging from primitive forms of barter to intricately developed gift exchange--are possible without markets, trading systems that become sufficiently widespread such that they reasonably establish market societies must rely on a common, acceptable, liquid currency--namely, money--to facilitate trade.</p><p>Contract is the key mechanism for exchanging entitlements, and this makes contract central to markets, however conceived. Accordingly, many of the Articles in this Issue consider how the law of various contract types--involving, for example, commercial dealings, consumer goods, or employment relationships--plays a crucial role in the construction of commercial, consumer, and labor markets, respectively. (2) Similarly, law can variously prescribe the scope and content of the property rights of owners over the means of production, which dramatically affects the contours of our labor markets. (3)</p><p>Often, even cursory attention to law suffices to realize its indispensable work in the construction of the market (or, more precisely, of a given market, since different markets are differently designed). But at times law's constructive role is more opaque, for two distinct reasons. First, the role of law may be such an entrenched aspect of background understandings that its arrangements seem axiomatic, or even conceptually necessary. Second, law's work may be indirect. Its effect may be an offshoot, or an unintended consequence of a legal doctrine whose raison d'etre actually lies elsewhere. Two of the Articles in this Issue offer telling examples.</p><p>Christine Desan's The Key to Value: The Debate over Commensurability in Neoclassical and Credit Approaches to Money (4) highlights this first aspect of law's opacity by exposing law's often obscured role at the most elemental level of constructing markets: creating the money that generates commensurable value that in turn facilitates ordered and preference-maximizing trade. On Desan's account, market economies cannot get off the ground without money that makes otherwise random desires into ordered and comparable values. Money is thus the condition of possibility for the emergence of widespread markets. But money is not a project conducted in pure abstraction. Instead, the concrete legal arrangements that form money's design inevitably push and pull people towards specific activities. A money system based on commercial banking privileges profit-making activity with relatively short time horizons. A system based solely on government-issued money would (and historically did) push towards different goals. Markets based on differently designed moneys do not simply facilitate preexisting preferences; they participate mightily in the very formation of values that people will pursue and through which they will understand themselves as individuals and as societies.</p><p>Kathleen Thelen's Employer Organization and the Law: American Exceptionalism in Comparative Perspective (5) highlights the second aspect of law's opacity in our understanding of markets: how law's indirect effects can become central for resulting market frameworks. Her comparison of Germany and the United States traces the collaborative relationship between labor unions and employers' associations of small entrepreneurs. In both settings, small- and medium-sized manufacturers saw organized labor as a potential partner in protecting themselves against cutthroat competition from marginal producers. In Germany, trade associations succeeded in coordinating strategy and negotiating with unions. In the United States, however, the loosely coordinated legal activism of small proprietary capitalists undermined burgeoning coalitions between employer organizations and unions. That legal activism took the form of antiunion litigation based on antitrust law, and it was successful enough to weed out the kinds of sectoral employer and trade organizations that survived in the European legal context. American antitrust law was born out of concerns about large concentrations of capital, but it was instead successfully directed against the unions. This shift in orientation pulled the rug out from under the cooperative frameworks developing between unions and employers.</p><p>III ARCHITECTURE</p><p>The notion of a legal construct does not imply that law's architects can design the market in whatever shape they choose, as if writing on a blank slate. To be both legitimate and effective, law must face (respectively) justificatory and instrumental constraints. Consider first the instrumental constraints, which the architects of the law must recognize if they are to rise to the challenges of constructing successful markets. Both the constraints and the challenges derive from the same truism: law's prescriptions are not self-executing. They are mediated by legal institutions, and their effects depend on the responses both of their addressees and of third parties who may be interested in the subject matter at hand. Appreciating the significance of these two dimensions is key to understanding the constraints and the challenges faced by the law of the market.</p><p>The institutional dimension is particularly acute in the common law tradition, which strongly associates private law with adjudication. Court proceedings are sometimes perceived as an obvious home for the law of the market, since adjudication is designed to assess the parties' behavior vis-a-vis their interpersonal rights and obligations as well as to refine the rules that delineate these rights and obligations to begin with. But in a complex and interconnected society, it is increasingly difficult to expect courts to be solely responsible for the provision of the infrastructure needed for a secure marketplace. This is a mission that often requires general legislation, and at times a full-blown administrative apparatus, to supplement or even supplant courts. The law of the market is therefore a product of a joint venture among legislatures, administrative agencies, and a host of quasi-public and even fully private organizations, all working alongside courts. (6)</p><p>There is widespread agreement that regulation should attempt to address systemic market failures. (7) When monopolies, externalities, or informational inadequacies are rampant, an \"uncontrolled marketplace\" will likely \"fail to produce behavior or results in accordance with the public interest.\" (8) But often regulation is also useful--and sometimes indispensable--for another purpose: the articulation, development, and vindication of market actors' interpersonal rights. It may be necessary for ensuring the generality of legal prescription, allowing people to adjust their behavior to conform to the rule of law, maintaining the required technological expertise for legal decision making, and establishing effective tools for proactive (as opposed to reactive) ex ante guarantees of people's interpersonal rights. (9)</p><p>Institutional considerations figure importantly in effective regulation. Those who design the law of the market should attend to the virtues, limitations, and possible pitfalls of the expected performances of the various institutions involved in regulating market life. Moreover, law--especially the law of the market--must also anticipate and consider the expected responses of the pertinent private actors. Well-informed and sophisticated parties are especially likely to take law's prescriptions as incentives rather than norms. In other words, legally-informed actors--both law's potential addressees and interested third parties--may act in ways that circumvent the law's intended effects and thus possibly undermine its normative underpinnings. If the architects of the law of the market are interested in law's expected consequences, they must take seriously its incentive effects and be particularly attentive to the concern of counterproductive legal prescriptions. (10)</p><p>Consequently, designing the law of the market is a complex task. The designers must examine the likely responses and counter-responses of market actors in order to foresee the ultimate outcomes of the competing legal regimes. These complications are further exacerbated in a globalized environment, which is increasingly typified by international regulatory competition. (11) At times, these complications might frustratingly suggest that certain objectives or normative commitments are elusive. More often, they imply that achieving a normative goal is not as straightforward as it may seem; that choices must be made among competing imperfect alternatives, each of which must be carefully designed and institutionalized.</p><p>Kim Oosterlinck, Joseph Blocher, and Mitu Gulati's Article, Why Did Belgium Pay Leopold's Bonds?, (12) draws on Belgian King Leopold II's reign over the Congo Free State (CFS) to study the interactions among market forces and legal doctrines that might police illicit conduct. King Leopold II, effectively the private owner of the CFS, relied heavily on issuing bond obligations to establish, run, and brutally exploit his private colony. Sovereign borrowing markets could have reacted to his horrific abuse of his Congolese subjects in at least two ways. First, the markets could have raised the costs of the loans issued by Leopold II on behalf of the CFS. Second, Belgium, the successor government to this despot, could have repudiated King Leopold II's debt by invoking the doctrine of odious debts. The two reactions are intimately related as the former might follow from the possible occurrence of the latter. Hence, the legal doctrine of odious debts may put economic, not merely moral, pressure on the market standing of a malevolent despot.</p><p>However, the authors find no evidence of any market penalty on the debt that funded Leopold's wicked rule. Nor did Belgium invoke the odious debts doctrine upon purchasing the CFS from Leopold; instead, it accepted responsibility for his debts and paid them. What makes these outcomes possible is the legal design of the securities markets on which the debt traded. In particular, presenting the doctrine of odious debts as an option held by the successor government opens the way for lenders to base their borrowing decisions on financial, rather than moral, reasons. As a result, the otherwise important distinction between sinful and virtuous bonds becomes optional as well.</p><p>Robert Scott's Article, The Paradox of Contracting in Markets, (13) in turn, demonstrates both the challenge of setting up the rules of the law of the market so that they properly serve a desired normative goal (in Scott's case, efficiency) and the institutional dimension that must accompany such inquiries. Efficiency, he claims, implies two quite different objectives: improving contractual incentives that motivate parties to invest and trade; and economizing on the production costs of contracts by facilitating the parties' abilities to realize the scale advantages of standardization. The difficulty is that these two objectives conflict. Standardization and economies of scale, which are key to the efficient production of contracts, tend to undermine the efficiency of contractual incentives. And bespoke efforts to motivate efficient investment and trade generate a loss of scale and thus inefficient production of contracts.</p><p>Drawing on the way contracting parties in thick, multilateral markets optimize between these two conflicting effects, Scott claims that the key to efficiency lies in creating a functioning network of effective coordination, which can overcome the collective action problem that entrenches inefficiencies and is endemic to the process of producing contracts in thick markets. This solution, however, is unavailable in multilateral consumer markets. But it can be, and to some extent has been, substituted with a regulatory structure that can coordinate efforts to produce more efficient consumer contracts, thus avoiding the existing pricing errors that end up as rents that producers currently capture.</p><p>IV DANGERS</p><p>Some observers believe that central planning does not present a viable alternative for organizing large-scale economies, which means that the market economy is the only game in town. (14) Others, of course, disagree. (15) But even if, or maybe especially if, the former view is correct, it is important to identify the immanent risks that market modes of organization typically raise. (16)</p><p>Market essentialists view this inquiry as the battlefield over whether market ordering is acceptable at all (either generally, or in one specific realm of activity). In certain contexts, this may be the right question to ask. But most cases do not raise the dramatic binary choice of either market or no market. Instead, appreciating a risk that a market structure might bring about in a certain setting may help to refine the law that governs that setting. Or, there may be a way to at least ameliorate the risk by deploying countervailing legal devices. Even risks that cannot be eradicated without sacrificing the advantages of market structures can generally be managed. While such managing measures should not make market designers complacent, the possibility of addressing the pertinent pitfalls invites a more refined analysis, which may yield better results than a binary decision.</p><p>In this Foreword, we inevitably draw an abstract and imprecise picture. Nonetheless, it seems safe to state that the two main hazards that the market is said to produce are maldistribution and the commodification of human affairs. Both concerns are significant, and neither can be fully eliminated. And yet--at least in certain settings--recognizing them as potential pathologies may indeed help to identify acceptable legal responses.</p><p>Consider first the distributive injustices that markets produce. The market's currency of willingness to pay depends not only upon people's preferences, but also upon their ability to pay. In certain contexts, this truism is largely inconsequential, since the pertinent parties' ability to pay is roughly equal (or equal enough). But in other contexts, markets \"systematically tend to distribute legal entitlements to the rich, exacerbating inequality.\" (17) For reasons of political economy, a subset of these unfortunate distributional consequences are likely to be rather sticky. (18) Regressive consequences threaten to defy any plausible normative foundation of the law of the market. Therefore, friends of the market must not perceive these regressive consequences as part of the market's appeal, but rather as unfortunate pathological effects that ought to be mitigated where possible. (19)</p><p>Addressing distributive distortions through the law of the market is a tricky challenge, especially given the expected responses of legally-informed actors, noted above in Part III. This means that oftentimes properly confronting this challenge requires a broader toolkit, including a background public regime of tax and redistribution. (20) The recursive nature of the game between lawmakers and the addressees of their prescriptions, as well as the political economy of tax and welfare legislation, imply, however, that this route is no panacea.</p><p>A similar analysis applies to the concern of commodification of people and their interpersonal relationships. This concern arises most forcefully when market mechanisms are introduced into a realm of life previously outside the sphere of commodities. Commodifying personal relations, such as friendship or romance, or practices with independent logics of value, such as art, sports, or politics, into the thin monetary terms that typify the market is troublesome, on this view. Commodification threatens to undermine these independent norms and to flatten or even efface worthy aspects of a world characterized by plural normative systems. (21) The gravity of this risk of commodification and its scope of application are disputed. (22) For our purposes it is enough to observe that, as with the concern that markets can be regressive, the risk of devastating commodification need not imply wholesale rejection of market mechanisms. The law of the market can employ techniques of incomplete commodification, which aim at ensuring that, while entitlements are exchanged, interactions retain their personal aspect or their non-commodity logic of relations. (23)</p><p>These risks of market formations are more or less familiar. Two of the Articles in this Issue raise another risk, one that may be conceptually different, in the sense that it might not be similarly ameliorated. In their Articles, both Katharina Pistor and Przemyslaw Palka focus on some of the implications of the recent rise of online markets, highlighting the danger that these developments might cause the market to undermine itself. What might seem at first glance to be a perfection of market logic, they warn us, might end up as a market facade that is in essence a new form of social planning.</p><p>Katharina Pistor's Article, Rule by Data: The End of Markets?, (24) considers the possible implications of technology--the rise of big data and artificial intelligence, in particular--for the competition between two forms of economic ordering: market versus hierarchical orderings. Traditionally, this competition is explained by reference to transaction costs. (25) At some point on the transaction cost scale, it is more efficient to organize economic activities hierarchically (for example, by creating a firm) than by way of free and open exchange on the market. Pistor argues that technological transformations might make hierarchical orderings more efficient than market orderings even when transaction costs are rather trivial. Instead of engaging in a bargained-for exchange of goods, consumers would be provided with the goods that best satisfy their bargain-independent preferences. Pistor further worries that economies of scale might make it more beneficial for mega internet firms (or Big Tech) to control the information necessary to run this hierarchy-based economic order. This end-of-markets script is regrettable, Pistor argues, because it undermines the egalitarian foundations of market exchange and subjects people to domination by powerful, private entities. Her solution considers two possible legal avenues. The first builds on property law. Pistor believes that data should have been made res communis in the first place. But since lawmakers have failed to do so, she identifies an alternative avenue--business organization law--as a source of recognizing consumers as holders of collective rights in data. This remedy may not bring back market orderings, but it could provide a substantial antidote to consumer domination by Big Tech's data.</p><p>Przemyslaw Palka's Algorithmic Central Planning: Between Efficiency and Freedom (26) also wonders whether big data and algorithmic processing might lead market mechanisms to undermine the practices of individual choice on which conventional market logics depend. By making individual preferences computable, these technological innovations promise--or threaten--to build an effectively-planned economy through the incremental empowering of private central planners rather than through the revolutionary creation of a centrally planning state. Palka proposes that soon, if not already today, companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon will know more about individual people's preferences than will the individuals themselves, and these firms' algorithms will be able to satisfy people's preferences more accurately, and at lower transaction costs, than the people's own choices. This produces a powerful pressure to displace the individual market transactions that presently organize production and consumption with decision-by-algorithm, which is just central planning by another name. Palka worries both about the processes that will yield this transformation, and about the eventual outcome. Will we choose, with collective or even individual deliberation, to cede our market choices to algorithmic planning? And even if algorithms actually do better satisfy our preferences than our own market choices could, is an algorithmically-planned economy desirable? Or, alternatively, is the act of choosing valuable apart from its results, so that choice is not a transaction cost but rather, as one might say, a transaction benefit?</p><p>V RESPONSIBILITY</p><p>Some discussions of the market obscure another important proposition. Market forces--the actions of buyers and sellers that affect the availability and price of goods and services--are sometimes presented as or assumed to be either prior to law or beyond law's responsibility. This presupposition is the flipside of the conventional use of government intervention noted above. (27) In this view, law can, for better or for worse, only respond to--control, influence, affect--market forces. But it cannot be held responsible for these powers in and of themselves.</p><p>If what we have said thus far is correct, the conventional view is partial and misleading. The market is an artifact shaped by humans and can be variously designed. Describing the conventional view as artificial is not a condemnation. After all, most of the important aspects of our social life are human-made. Just like the study of other valuable human-made institutions, a clear-headed understanding and analysis of markets should be careful not to essentialize the current instantiation of the market, as if it were completely beyond human control.</p><p>Richard Brooks's Article, Black Markets and the Exchange Structure, (28) challenges the central role that we give law in constructing markets while aspiring to avoid the naturalism and essentialism about markets that we reject. Brooks proposes that every society has an \"exchange structure\"--a set of norms and practices that governs transactions among the society's members with an eye to preserving respect for its own rules. The exchange structure, for Brooks, precedes the state and its laws, and law enters the scene to stabilize and validate this structure. Critically, Brooks insists, the problems of legitimacy and stability never get a conclusive resolution--the need to preserve the exchange structure against decay never subsides. Moreover, Brooks observes, a zero-tolerance policy towards deviants rarely, if ever, best promotes stability. Instead, exchange structures must find ways to de-fang violations of their rules--to cabin deviations--in a manner that supports the survival of the very rules and systems that the deviants challenge. They must, Brooks says, evolve \"various strategies allowing transgression while limiting [transgression's] follow-on consequences\" in order to maintain the structure's durability. (29) Black markets, for Brooks, serve precisely this role. And a study of their normative structure--their mix of express prohibitions and implicit permissions--reveals something deep about the role of the law in sustaining, and giving a normative frame to, markets generally.</p><p>The power of the law is not limitless. As we've seen, the law of the market faces constraints. To begin with, for markets to exist as realms of voluntary transactions, there must be limits on legal coercion in and around market activities. That said, because it is law that sets up the rules of the game--the contours of people's Hohfeldian powers as owners and promisees, as well as their access to money--law necessarily engages in market-making. Therefore, even where its workings should be somewhat constrained, the law cannot be completely detached from responsibility for the transactions it both authorizes and enforces, and from the societal results of that transactional world. (30)</p><p>Avihay Dorfman's Article, The Limited Case for Discrimination's Legality, (31) considers non-contingent constraints on the legal enforcement of antidiscrimination duties. He asks what principled concerns might justify relieving market actors of the proscriptions of antidiscrimination law. Although there may be any number of epistemic and instrumental hurdles to calling the moral duty against discrimination into law, Dorfman argues for a substantive concern, namely, free agency. On this concern, a liberal law of the market must treat private persons, including those who act from discriminatory motivation, as free and equal agents. Doing so requires recognizing that such persons are entitled to change their minds by revising their discriminatory motivations and acting in conformity with the demands of right reason (narrowly defined to exclude clear instances of bigotry). Dorfman distinguishes between an outward act of refusing to deal with another and its underlying illicit motivation. He then argues that holding a bigot legally responsible for acquiring morally unacceptable motives while executing a perfectly legitimate act undermines the bigot's free agency. The explanation is that the law denies him or her the opportunity to act, including by repeating the refusal to deal with another, on the basis of morally sound motives by revising the current one.</p><p>More generally, the law of the market, both when it coerces and when it authorizes, has profound implications for people's lives. Therefore, for the law of the market to be legitimate, let alone just, it should be designed in a way that is both attentive to the dangers and the limitations we've discussed and normatively acceptable. (32)</p><p>Recognizing the role of law in shaping markets drives a better understanding of their plasticity and thus helps clarify thinking about how markets might be designed. That has been our primary task, but clarity engenders an additional task. When we recognize the law's role in designing markets and appreciate the range of choices open to the architects of the law of the market, we must then ask about the normative underpinnings of markets. These architects should evaluate existing market formations and either reject, reform, or perhaps embrace them--but the evaluations must not, and cannot possibly, rest on a merely technical account of what makes a market. Instead, they should realize that different market designs have different normative implications. Indeed, recognizing the crucial role of law in the construction of markets and appreciating that markets are complex phenomena with heterogeneous manifestations does not, and should not, dissipate controversies. Quite the contrary: it highlights the significance of the competing normative ideals for which the market can stand.</p><p>VI NORMATIVE FOUNDATIONS</p><p>The Articles in this Issue highlight the options, limits, dangers, and responsibilities that the legal construction of markets entails. These are all necessary aspects of a legally-informed study of the market. But they are still not sufficient. The market, as noted, is a thick ethical concept, which means that such a study necessarily implicates an analysis of the various normative ideals markets can serve. We thus conclude with a brief outline of three normative market ideals: efficient markets, democratic markets, and liberal markets.</p><p>Efficient markets are designed so as to maximize economic output. An approach to markets that emphasizes efficiency thus takes an essentially allocative view of markets. It evaluates market orderings neither in light of the relations that they underwrite among traders nor in terms of the relations that they produce between traders and the state, but rather according to the ways in which markets distribute goods in service of investment, production, and, ultimately, consumption.</p><p>Efficiency-based approaches therefore treat markets instrumentally, as technologies for producing outcomes that are assessed as desirable (or not) without making any essential reference to their having been produced by means of market exchanges. Typically, these approaches assess market outcomes using the technical language of efficiency developed by economists. This includes, for example, the Kaldor-Hicks conception that dominates both the law and economics of contract, property, and torts and the cost-benefit analysis deployed in administrative law and the study of regulation. This is why we use the term \"efficient markets.\" But the basic structure of these approaches does not require that they evaluate outcomes using precisely this metric. All that is essential is that they view markets as a means to an end. That end might be utilitarian (the greatest good for the greatest number) or even egalitarian (on any one of many conceptions of equality). The core of the view lies in the maximizing, not the maximand.</p><p>Democratic markets have a very different ideal in mind. Markets are sites for exchanging entitlements over resources. Often, an idealized image of the market presents that exchange as if it could completely circumvent disagreements and disputes about the underlying reasons people have for valuing certain resources or activities above others. The shorthand for that idealization is that the market is a place where the buyer votes with her dollars, and nobody questions why she values one product over another. This shorthand describes some markets quite well. Its underlying normative vision--according to which depersonalized and apolitical markets allow for cooperative behavior among people otherwise potentially disposed to conflict--certainly has its attractions. But it may sell short the potential markets hold for advancing active participation in the value conflicts that govern our lives.</p><p>Control over resources implies authority over others, so if markets are the locus of transacting for entitlements to control, then they are intertwined inevitably with authority relations. The design of markets thus necessarily raises questions as to how authority should be allocated, what kinds of authority relationships are acceptable, and what society should demand of authority relations, particularly among strangers. Given the plasticity of markets outlined above, it seems plausible that the law could contribute to market formations with a range of authority relations vis-a-vis various resources. We could imagine authority heavily concentrated, or widely dispersed. We could imagine it protected by substantive and procedural barriers, or porous and open to contestation. Perhaps most concretely, we can imagine authority as established in a sense that closes off disagreement about underlying value, or alternatively as open to challenge precisely on that ground.</p><p>Contestation over underlying values need not obviate the market; in certain cases, it might give participation in a market its full meaning. When market participants articulate the contestation over values, they highlight the activity as a social arrangement, as a set of relationships among people, rather than mere exchange of inert objects. If conditions are right (for example, if the law of the market makes it possible), market participants can call into question the givenness of relations that currently govern work and property ownership, breaking down reification. In the best-case scenario, market participants use their market voice to animate their moral and political lives, to assert self-government in contexts crucial for their well-being and flourishing.</p><p>Four of the Articles in this Issue put questions of democratic participation in markets into focus. Desan's Key to Value: The Debate over Commensurability in Neoclassical and Credit Approaches to Money (33) reminds us that the model of money creation dominated by an independent central bank in cooperation with commercial banks is geared toward a limitation of democratic input. Pistor's Rule by DataM shows how tech giants have succeeded (so far) in limiting active participation by end users regarding authority over the data mined from their online activity. Palka's Algorithmic Central Planning (35) worries that individual acts (33) could cumulate to produce a planned economy without any collective decision. And Thelen's Employer Organization and the Law: American Exceptionalism in Comparative Perspective (36) shows how well-targeted legal activism managed to thwart organizational attempts in one legal context, while similar ventures succeeded in another. Each of these Articles might be generalized thus: one of the features at stake in the design of markets is the allocation of authority. There are ways to allocate that authority that encourage continued participation in the contestation over underlying values, and ways to limit such participation.</p><p>We denote the third market ideal-type a liberal market since it grounds markets in the moral quality of individual traders rather than in collective benefits. Once again, a range of views all embrace this liberal frame, even as they fill in its details very differently. Three views in particular bear mentioning here.</p><p>First, and on the right side of the liberal spectrum, libertarian views emphasize the role that markets play in securing individual freedom. Some (in our minds less plausible) varieties of libertarianism about markets flirt with a naturalized account of property entitlements and even the basic rules of contract. These views propose that markets respect liberty against this naturalized backdrop, by protecting people against involuntary expropriation or enforced exchange. Other varieties of libertarianism (perhaps most profoundly, Hayek's) emphasize both the informational and the normative problems that confront alternatives to market-based ways of organizing economic life. (37) Planning, in particular, requires enormous quantities of information concerning both preferences and capabilities. And even if the purely fact-based informational problems confronting planning can be solved (perhaps through developments in algorithmic data processing), planners still face daunting evaluative and normative challenges. People value different things for different reasons, and planners cannot do their jobs without deciding which values are true and authoritative. But when planners make such evaluative judgments, they wrongfully usurp the proper independence and offend against the dignity of the people whose lives they plan. This is a subtle defense of markets, and far from the market fundamentalism that the other sort of libertarianism invites. In particular, the wrong of planning is tied to the central, authoritative declaration of what is valuable. Therefore, not every state intervention in economic life commits this wrong. That is why Hayek, who abhorred planning, did not object to regulation, especially where regulation serves to promote widespread participation in market life or to prevent private forms of domination from arising. (38)</p><p>The problem of disagreement about value that exercises some libertarians also underwrites the second, left-leaning, egalitarian variant of liberal approaches to markets. When people value different things for different reasons, economic and social coordination depend on establishing a shared language of value that people can deploy for purposes of their commercial lives. Market prices establish this language of value. The price of a good (at least in an idealized pure exchange economy) equals what everyone else must give up for its owner to possess it, as measured by a formally equal amalgam of all of their preferences. This thought leads some left-liberals (perhaps most notably, Ronald Dworkin) to insist that, far from being forces against equality, markets are essential for economic equality to be intelligible at all. (39) Without prices and the commensuration of value that they make possible, it is impossible to know who has how much. It is therefore also impossible to say who has more, and who has less, than justice requires. One of us has gone even farther, to argue that the normative structure of market exchange, and in particular the authority relations produced by the contracts through which market exchange occurs, establishes a form of valuable market solidarity that stands beside the political solidarity produced by democratic politics in the liberal states in which markets typically thrive. (40) Of course, this approach faces challenges just like any other, perhaps most notably the challenge that fiat money's connection to politics and the state (not least through modern central banking) deprives prices of the egalitarian quality and commensurate power on which equality of resources or market solidarity depend. (41) Here, a great deal will turn on whether some version of Hayek's distinction between regulation and planning may be introduced into left-liberal theory, to renovate prices in the face of the challenge posed by money's political nature.</p><p>Finally, the third variation of liberal markets relies on individual autonomy, rather than independence. It thus begins with the proposition that for people to lead the fully human life they are entitled to, law must be committed to enhancing their self-determination (or self-authorship). (42) Markets are potentially conducive to people's self-determination because they allow individuals the mobility necessary for self-determination, and since they expand the options available to individuals to function as the authors of their own lives.</p><p>Markets, more specifically, enable the liquidation of existing holdings and thus facilitate people's right to exit: to withdraw or refuse to further engage, to dissociate, to cut themselves out of a relationship with other persons. Exit, in turn, is crucial to autonomy because open boundaries enable geographical, social, familial, professional, and political mobility, which are prerequisites for a self-directed life. Markets further extend this autonomy-enhancing function by broadening the scope of choices between differing projects and ways of life. By facilitating people's ability to legitimately enlist one another in the pursuit of private goals and purposes and creating a structure that multiplies the alternatives people can choose from, markets enable the individual to act--on her own or with the cooperation of others--upon her own goals, values, objectives, and her plan of life, without subordination to any other individual or subjection to any collective decision making procedure.</p><p>Markets with the primary goal of autonomy enhancement will have several characteristics. Autonomy-enhancing markets must allow universal participation since exclusion and discrimination would undermine their raison d'etre. They should also set limits on the power to alienate whenever it erodes our ability to rewrite our life stories and start anew. Such markets should proactively ensure meaningful choices in each major sphere of human action and interaction. However, this injunction of intra-sphere multiplicity must be curtailed where cognitive, behavioral, structural, and political economy reasons imply that more choice may actually reduce autonomy. (43) Moreover, when markets are structured to serve autonomy, market relationships are governed by rules that require reciprocal respect for self-determination, meaning that party interactions in the market are governed by the maxim of relational justice. (44) Furthermore, since utility is understood to be instrumental to the markets' ultimate value--autonomy--the law of the market must avoid the commodification of people and interpersonal relationships. It should thus employ, in some subsets of the settings it governs, the techniques of incomplete commodification, noted earlier, which ensure that these market interactions retain a personal aspect. (45)</p><p>Finally, an autonomy-based law of the market must be particularly careful not to marginalize the broader picture, in which the justice of the market is partially dependent upon a background regime that guarantees the conditions of individual self-determination. Rather than striving to exclusivity, the law of the market, in this view, is attuned to its distinct autonomy-enhancing tasks of enabling mobility and expanding choice, while acknowledging the indispensable role of other social institutions in enabling these vital functions.</p><p>VII CONCLUSION</p><p>Every market order is the result of a complex set of legal and political choices. This Foreword has offered an intellectual roadmap for a legally informed study of the market. Drawing on the insight that markets are plural and open to variable design, it reflects on both the options and constraints faced by law's architects. It discusses certain familiar and less familiar risks in market design. In order to understand the risks and rewards of market orderings and to take on the responsibility of market design, this Foreword identifies three ideal-typical visions of markets--efficient, democratic, and liberal--and summarizes the values that these ideal-types deploy to address these challenges.</p><p>Hanoch Dagan, Stewart and Judy Colton Professor of Legal Theory and Innovation &amp; Director of the Edmond J.

At least with regard to some accounts of the ideal market, a similar analysis should apply to luck, which for Frank Knight is the most important feature of the market. See Frank H. Knight, The Ethics of Competition, 37 Q.J. Econ. 579, 609 (1923) (\"The luck element moreover is so large--far larger than fairly successful participants in the game will ever admit--that capacity and effort may count for nothing.\").</p><p>(20.)

One need not develop a deep commitment to plural normative systems to appreciate the simple point we advance here. Even in activities organized by high stakes markets, like professional sports, it would strike any fan as scandalous if an MVP award was simply handed to the player with the highest salary (because of the salary itself, as a sole indication of what it meant to be \"the most valuable player\"). The example might seem frivolous, but it serves to highlight the fact that market and non-market logic are likely to live side-by-side within many of our everyday practices. The \"danger\" is usually a question of a contest between logics and the moments of line-crossing.

The idea of responsibility we use here may strike the reader as a bit unorthodox (it is certainly quite far from the idea of responsibility in say, torts or criminal law). What we have in mind is that designing the law of the market should take into account the expected results of the adopted design. The fact that system design does not ensure particular results with known individuals as winners and losers does not absolve the designer from the task of considering overall effects (just as the designers of highways must take into account actual driving without knowing who in particular will need to use the road-shoulder). We do not intend by this to collapse into one another different levels of responsibility, for instance those of particular actors and those of system designers.</p><p>(31.) 83 Law &amp; Contemp.

Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon are being investigated for potential antitrust violations. That means lawmakers are trying to figure out whether the companies have used anti-competitive business practices designed to stifle smaller competitors and to maintain a monopoly of the markets. Antitrust laws have a century-old history in the US for keeping such mega-corporations across various sectors \u2014 oil, railroad, finance \u2014 from getting too big and powerful. </p><p>But these laws aren't yet well-suited to apply to tech firms at the forefront of 21st-century innovation. How long has this been going on? This hearing is just one pit stop in an antitrust investigation that Congress has been conducting for over a year. Smaller competitors on the rise[2] have testified in front of the House Judiciary subcommittee since June alleging the big four's use of anti-competitive business practices. Why is this important? This hearing is the first time the four CEOs will testify at the same Congressional hearing. And it's the first time Bezos, the richest person in the world with a net worth of $171.6 billion[3], will testify before Congress. But most notably, this is one of the first steps toward laying the groundwork for antitrust regulation in the tech world. The hearing also comes as the industry continues to reel from the \"Techlash,\" or widespread backlash against tech that especially picked up steam in 2018. Issues such as user data privacy, abuse of power, and the role these firms can play in influencing political outcomes have contributed to a growing animosity and weariness of big tech. Who exactly will be testifying, or giving their testimonials? The CEOs of the American technology industry's most powerful companies. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Apple's Tim Cook will all be in attendance, likely virtually.[4] Lawmakers have also called upon Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey[5] to attend the hearing in light of the widespread hack that took over the site on July 15. The hack exposed Twitter's vulnerability to security breaches. It's still unclear whether or not Dorsey will attend. And what are they being investigated for specifically? They're appearing together in the same hearing, but each company isn't necessarily being probed for the exact same thing.Lawmakers will likely question Google[6] in regard to its iron grip on the ad and search market. Apple is being investigated over claims that it gives its own apps special treatment over third parties in its App Store. Facebook is in the spotlight for the acquisitions it has made in recent years of would-be competitors, namely WhatsApp, Instagram, and Giphy. And Amazon will be probed for potentially promoting its own brands ahead of third-party sellers. If each company is being accused of different antitrust violations, why are they doing a joint hearing? The House representatives involved in the antitrust investigation chose to question the four CEOs together. But as Protocol[7] notes, doing so may not be as effective as if they testified separately, which would have allowed lawmakers to tailor their questions more specifically to each company instead of doing a blanket inquiry. What's going to happen during the hearing? The lawmakers will take turns grilling the CEOs with their questions, many of which may overlap. The questions will probe the executives into laying out aspects of their business practices, and the CEOs in turn will attempt to make the case for why they aren't infringing on the competition.It's unclear which order the CEOs will be questioned in or whether they'll be questioned one at a time or alternately. This type of hearing can sometimes go on for hours. Is this the first time this has happened? The four CEOs appearing together in an antitrust hearing, yes. But this isn't the first time an antitrust investigation has taken over the tech world. In the late 1990s, Microsoft was hit with an antitrust lawsuit[8] as the Seattle firm began gaining dominance in the internet market. A federal judge ruled that the company was indeed in violation, and Microsoft reached a settlement with the government in 2001, but the case has gone down in history as one of the more high-profile examples of the effect that antitrust laws can have on tech. What will happen afterward? Will they be found guilty of something? The hearing isn't a trial with a verdict. Instead, it's for lawmakers to question the tech execs and gather evidence through their testimonies that can inform the subcommittee's ongoing investigation. But the broader investigation could eventually result in legislation designed to keep tech companies from growing too large and powerful. Can I watch the hearing? Yes[9]. The hearing is scheduled to take place at Washington, DC's Rayburn House Office Building at the Capitol, but it'll be live-streamed on the House Judiciary Committee's YouTube channel. Click here to watch it.[10]Per the hearing notice[11], lawmakers and witnesses are allowed to attend virtually. Sources told Reuters[12] that the four CEOs will do exactly that, so you may not see them in a courtroom. Instead, they'll likely be tuning in via video. When is this happening? It's now slated for Wednesday, July 29[13] at noon ET, or 9 a.m. PT, according to the House Judiciary website. It was originally scheduled for Monday but postponed due to a memorial service for Rep. John Lewis, who will lie in state at the US Capitol this week.

These leaders, representing Apple, Google (Youtube), Amazon and Facebook (WhatsApp), were well prepared to lie to a committee that itself had divided goals. It could be, and has been, said that all of the House Committee presented themselves as critical of the Big Tech leaders, but not for the same reasons. The Democrats were concerned with issues like antitrust - the companies being 'too big' or 'monopolies' in their industries. </p><p>However, in so doing they sidestepped - and disagreed with - the GOP representatives, who are deeply concerned about the well known fact that these companies are engaging in editorial review of news and information posted on their social networks, and in doing so are stepping far out of line from the de-facto roles as communications utility companies. Right now this issue is not resolved because an old FCC regulation has not been been adequately defined[2] to determine that these censorship practices are in fact, unlawful. As a matter of fact, this issue firmly sits in the realm of ethics, and since all of these leaders are Democrate to even radical Democrats, they see no problem in tailoring their platforms to 'lose' or 'disallow' information from conservative writers. In recent times, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Breitbart News, and many others have been knocked completely off the major platforms of Facebook and Google and YouTube. Rush Limbaugh's podcasts tend to last only a few hours before the platform removes them. I have currently this beauty posted to one my my news pieces about Holy Communion being banned in Toronto[3], where Facebook employed AFP (Agence France-Presse) to 'fact check' my piece and claim that it was untrue. (However, it actually IS true and the fact checker reportedly used the very news piece that says it IS true to say it wasn't, apparently picking at the word 'suspended', not realizing that that means 'not allowed', a.k.a. 'banned.')Agence France-Presse claiming that my newspiece 'Toronto bans Holy Communion in Churches' was false, when in fact, it was true. The city ordinance said 'suspended' were communion services. What else is 'suspended' supposed to mean?I further experience censorship by being disallowed to post news articles fromThe Duran or other conservative outlets on Facebook. I am presently crippled by not being able to distribute many news pieces across many groups who are interested in them. TheBreitbartnewspiece addresses what happened:The most powerful tech CEOs in the country, representing Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel to discuss their market dominance and censorship yesterday. Here are some of the most misleading answers the CEOs gave Congress. Yesterday, the CEO's of major American tech firms Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook appeared before the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel to discuss the market dominance of their firms and issues relating to censorship on their platforms. During the hearing, the CEOs made a number of claims relating to their platforms and the competition they face. Each of the CEOs made extremely misleading statements, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai regularly misrepresenting how Google operates or the competition the tech giant faces. Here are six instances where the Masters of the Universe stretched the truth: We will not give all the details here, and we encourage our readers to go to Breitbard to capture all of this piece, but we do want to give the main points. We continue, with some emphases added: 1: Google's Sundar Pichai Claims it 'Faces New Competition Every Day' Google accounts for 90 percent of online searches according to GlobalStats[4], while competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo may attempt to compete with Google, the company faces no real threat or competition. Google's search dominance is one of the reasons that the company was able to suppress[5] the search results of Breitbart News and other conservative news websites,essentially 'purging Breitbart content from search results since the 2016 election,' according to Breitbart News' reporter Allum Bokhari. 2: Google CEO Sundar Pichai: 'We Don't Approach Work With Any Political Viewpoint' Pichai claimed[6] during yesterday's hearing that the tech giant does not approach its work with any particular political viewpoint, a concept disproved[7] by Breitbart News' extensive reporting on the company's political bias. During yesterday's hearing, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) addressed Pichai, stating: [I]t also seems noteworthy that whistleblowers at your own company have spoken out. You said that one of the reasons you maintain this manual tool is to stop election interference, I believe it is in fact your company that is engaging in elction interference.You're using your market dominance in search to accomplish that election interference. Recently Breitbart News reported[8] that Breitbart's ranking in Google's search engine had diminished significantly following our publication of a story in 2016 thatat an internal meeting leaked to Breitbart News, top Google executives, including Sundar Pichai, Sergey Brin, and Kent Walker, expressed their anger over President Trump's election and compared Trump voters to 'extremists.' During the meeting, the executives discussed their desire tomake Trump's election and the populist movement a 'blip' in history.[9] Breitbart News reporter Allum Bokhari writes: Search visibility is a key industry measure of how findable a publisher's content is in Google search. New data shows that Google has suppressed Breitbart's search visibility by 99.7 percent since 2016. On April 4, 2016, Breitbart ranked in the top ten search positions (i.e., on the first page of Google search results) for 355 key search terms; but now, as of July 20, 2020, Breitbart ranks in the top ten search positions for only one search term. And, on April 4, 2016, Breitbart ranked in the top 100 search positions for 16,820 key search terms; but now, as of July 20, 2020, Breitbart ranks in the top 100 search positions for only 55 search terms. Moreover, organic Google search traffic to Breitbart (measured by unique visitors) is down 63 percent when comparing the first half of 2016 with the first half of 2020. Breitbart News has repeatedly revealed Google's political bias, yet the company's CEO still attempts to claim that the tech giant does not approach its work 'with any political viewpoint.' 3: Sundar Pichai Claims Google Has 'Limited Presence in China' While it is true that due to China's restrictive 'Great Firewall' many U.S. companies such as Facebook and Google are unable to operate directly within the country, that hasn't stopped Google from making multiple deals with the Chinese government and attempting to launch a censored search engine for government officials. The search app, codenamed 'Project Dragonfly,' would have featured a list of unsearchable terms based on topics that are blocked by the government of China Sources told the Intercept that Gomes informed employees in July 2019 that the company planned to release the censored Chinese search engine as soon as possible and employees were to prepare the engine to be 'brought off the shelf and quickly deployed' once they received approval from Beijing. 4: Apple CEO Tim Cook Claims All App Developers Treated Equally Google's Sundar Pichai was not the only tech CEO to misrepresent how his company operates, Apple's Tim Cook also made[10] the bold claim that all iOS developers that attempt to have their app listed on Apple's App Store are treated equally However, Breitbart News has reported thatApple has a long history of removing apps from its store for a number of reasons and often with little cause. Breitbart Newsreported in 2016[11]that the app of the upstart social media network Gab was removed from the App Store by Apple over content posted by users on the platform, not content generated by the app itself. Gab CEO Andrew Torba commented at the time: 'The double standards of Silicon Valley are on full display with this app store rejection from Apple. Apps like Tumblr, Reddit, and Twitter are flooded with pornographic content and allowed to remain on the App store.' 'Gab empowers users to filter out this type of content, mute users who share it, and also features a reporting system to flag illegal content,' he continued. 'Apple went out of their way to seek out this content and find any reason to reject our app. We will continue to appeal this decision and defend free speech for everyone. In the meantime, Gab can be accessed from any mobile browser as always.' The Gab app is still unavailable in Apple's app store. 5: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Alleges Company Makes Up Less Than 1 Percent of Global Retail \u2014 Fails to Note U.S. Online Retail Market Dominance Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world and CEO of e-commerce giant Amazon, noted in his opening remarks claiming that Amazon was not a monopoly that: 'Amazon accounts for less than 1 percent of the [$]25 trillion in the global retail market and less than 4 percent of U.S. retail.' Bezos is correct about those figures, but conveniently leaves out an extremely important one: Amazon accounts for38 percent of all U.S. online shopping. Research firm eMarketer reports[12] that Amazon accounts for approximately 38 percent of U.S. e-commerce sales, generating around$260.86 billion in revenue. The reserach firm writes[13]: We forecast that Amazon's 2020 US retail ecommerce sales will rise 17.2% to $260.86 billion\u20144 percentage points higher than the expected overall growth rate for US retail ecommerce sales. As a result, Amazon's market share will increase from 37.3% in 2019 to 38.7% this year while expanding its lead over the No. 2 player from 31.7 points to 33.4 points. We expect this momentum to continue into 2021 when it will reach 39.7% market share. Andrew Lipsman, eMarketer principal analyst and report author, noted:'What's surprising is that despite accounting for nearly four in 10 e-commerce dollars, the company continues to gain market share and extend its lead.' So while Bezos is correct that in terms of global retail Amazon does not have a monopoly, it does have a stranglehold on e-commerce in the United States and a large chunk globally. 6: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Exaggerates Company's Competition Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a similar claim to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, that the tech giant regularly faces competition from other tech firms. Zuckerberg did this by suggesting that Facebook was competing with every single tech product that connects people, this would include video calling services such as Zoom or even niche social networks such as Pinterest. 'The space of people connecting with other people is a very large space,' Zuckerberg told Congress. This is technically true but what the CEO failed to mention is that69 percent of Americans are using Facebook,according to the Pew Research Center[14]. The next most popular social media network is the Facebook-owned photo and video-sharing app Instagram, which is used by 37 percent of U.S. adults. Zuckerberg may be able to argue that in the broad definition of tech that connects users together Facebook does not dominate the market, but in terms of actual social media network dominance, Facebook's power is unparalleled. Breitbart News[15]offers further news and opinion about this hearing at the linked text shown here. The CEO's indeed came prepared, rhetorically, but as one can see, they were pretty sure of themselves that they were not about to change their practices. These men have tremendous power because they basically control a huge amount of communication and commerce. For me, personally, the fact that they control such a large part of the market moneywise is not very important. As an Amazon consumer, for example, I appreciate the high quality of products and services Jeff Bezos' company brings. I also appreciate his efforts to develop commercialized space travel and tourism. I own and operate my own business with Apple products and I am very happy with my range of equipment that they make. For me, the vast fortunes these entrepreneurs have is well-earned and I think they ought to be able to continue making great products and services. But when anybody starts to interfere with that most precious right in America - the free exchange of ideas and opinions about anything andeverythingunder the sun, this is symptomatic of these very powerful men presuming to know what is good for everybody else, and that is elitism. It is one hundred percent clear that they are censoring conservative speech - they censor mine and others I know, over and over. For us, this is not a debate about 'if it exists', it is a question of 'how to deal with this; how to work the system to get through the firewalls or around them.' Ultimately new networks will gain a solid foothold and this may have already begun with Parler having gained an unbelievable number of users, mostly conservatives, in the last few weeks since the Big Tech censorship really increased. In time, this may create a competitive force against networks like Facebook, but it is also likely that because of Facebook's enormous penetration into many aspects of life for so many people, their censoring practices will create narratives that Facebook approves of, narratives capable of warping personal and group thinking, and creating a perilous situation for every user on their network, though the users may not realize it. 'Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.' - George Orwell, 1984. These guys control the present. We included the hearing in full length for anyone wishing to put themselves through such a feat. [embedded content] Article Rating Liked it?

The programs we choose to watch, the stores we care to shop at, and the products we bring into our homes are all within the control of our individual preference. Nobody wants Bernie Sanders picking their wardrobe in the morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Economic freedom is at the heart of our nation\u2019s envious prosperity. Unfortunately, the left sees freedom of choice through an entirely different lens, with their preferences beyond reproach, but everyone else\u2019s is subject to ideological approval. The left has made a cottage industry out of organizing boycotts against those who are not simpatico with their political agenda, from Chick-Fil-A, to Home Depot, to Fox News, but it is their willingness to use the power of the federal government to wage warfare against lawful businesses that is most chilling.</p><p>A prime example of this ideological bullying now centers on the U.S. banking industry, which has come under fire from liberal politicians for serving clients that the Left has tried but failed to regulate or legislate out of business. On Capitol Hill, bank executives are repeatedly being grilled by the likes of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Carolyn Maloney, and Sens. Brian Schatz and Elizabeth Warren, for extending credit and banking services to energy companies, gun makers, payday lenders, private detention companies, and others. </p><p>Knowing the power these lawmakers have over their institutions, bankers are heeding their words.</p><p>As a consequence, there is now a tug-of-war over the Community Reinvestment Act, which sets forth requirements that banks employ non-discriminatory practices in their lending in order to serve community needs. The comptroller of the currency recently issued new guidelines that seek to improve lending practices and increase bank activity in low- and moderate-income communities -- a move that seemingly keeps banks from favoring one type of customer over another based on political pressure. However, by limiting the criteria assessment for how banks serve their communities, the guidelines leave a large gap for bad practices.</p><p>A group of senators recognized this troubling pattern where banks are skirting their obligations in order to alleviate left-wing pressure. They called for review and revision of the CRA. Specifically, they asserted, \u201cthere is a clear body of evidence that the banks are withholding services explicitly to effectuate social change,\u201d rather than focusing on the pillars of profitability and safety and financial soundness. The Left is, of course, up in arms over these assertions and will oppose any effort to eradicate these lending practices. Political pressure from the Left has already led many banks (as well as airlines and insurance companies) to end promotions and discounts for NRA members, and that's just a foretaste of what\u2019s in store if the entire banking industry is held under the thumb of the Left\u2019s anti-capitalist agenda.</p><p>A secret Obama administration project, unleashed in 2013 and dubbed \u201cOperation Chokepoint,\u201d was the progenitor of the current campaign to de-bank ideologically incorrect businesses. Few Americans, including most in Congress, understood that the previous administration was running a covert program through the Department of Justice, FDIC, and CFPB, forcing banks to cut ties with lawful businesses that were ideologically unacceptable. Thankfully, the Trump administration ended this program, but the blueprint for Operation Chokepoint unfortunately lives on.</p><p>The concern regarding the politicization of our banking system is obvious, primarily because banking discrimination is prohibited by law. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notes that federal agencies \u201cwill not tolerate lending discrimination in any form.\u201d And that includes singling out customers whose business may offend a particular grievance group. No American is secure when our economic system, anchored in complex and comprehensive banking regulations, is held hostage to a political agenda.</p><p>Today it will be gun makers, private detentions, or fossil fuel companies finding themselves locked out of banks. Tomorrow it will be contractors building the border wall, or the defense industry, or Big Tech, or companies that dare serve religious institutions. What would happen if banks started targeting companies the Left favored, such as renewable energy companies or abortion clinics? Leftists would certainly sing a different tune then.</p><p>The poisoning of our banking system with ideological litmus tests will lead to a toxic and adversarial relationship with industries, which will hurt workers, small businesses, entrepreneurs, local communities, and America\u2019s economic competitiveness in general.</p><p>Discrimination in any form has no place in our economy, especially in banking system. Federal laws such as the CRA and the financial institutions it oversees can only serve consumers and our economy by operating with fairness and transparency. Our economy should not be held hostage based on what political party holds power in Washington.</p><p>Gerard Scimeca is co-founder and Vice President of CASE, Consumer Action for a Strong Economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2345484200</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2W-KJB1-JBHT-D48T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Apparently, Aghdam  believed that YouTube's content policies have somehow sabotaged her efforts  to become a digital video star.  Enraged, she drove to the company's  headquarters and opened fire.  That's what we know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now, let's pause for a moment and pretend this is not the 8 p.m.  show on  Fox News.  Let's pretend it's somewhere else on the dial.  Maybe \"CNN\" or  \"MSNBC\" or actually any other cable channel or newspaper in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> If that were true, by definition, we'd have to draw hard-and-fast  conclusions from this tragedy using the limited facts that are available.   We don't really know much at this stage, but sweeping dumb generalizations  are what the media do.  We would do that.  And, of course, we'd need a very  specific script in order to make those generalizations.</p><p> So, what do we conclude from what happened yesterday?  Well, first off, the  shooter was a woman.  She was female.  So, clearly, America has a problem  with toxic feminity.  And we need to address that crisis right away,  starting with more university panel shaming an entire gender.  Somebody  alert the HR department to this.</p><p> And then, there is the gun.  We focus relentlessly on the gun because  nothing is more pivotal in a shooting than the weapon that was used.  It's  always the gun's fault.  Always.</p><p> The shooter in this case used a Smith &amp; Wesson 9 mm handgun.  Those guns  need to be banned tomorrow, along with all other assault pistols.  Now, if  you disagree with that, you're evil.</p><p> Next, the shooter was a vegan and a supporter of PETA.  Therefore, PETA is  now a terrorist organization.  Anyone who supports PETA, even though  supporters who disapprove of mass shootings, is a monster and has blood on  his hands.</p><p> Let's hope that \"CNN\" hosts a town hall meeting where YouTube employees can  scream at PETA spokesman.  They deserved to be screaned at.  They caused  the shooting.</p><p> But, wait, media outlets aren't reaching any of those conclusions.  Why  not?  Well, because there's no obvious way to use this shooting to advance  the objectives of the Democratic Party.  So, the media will stop talking  about it soon.  That's how corrupt they are.</p><p> They're also incredibly stupid, especially on the subject of firearms.  The  people yelling at you about guns on television aren't sure what end the  bullet comes out.  They're kids.  They're children with all the ignorance  and moral certainty of fifth graders.</p><p> We can show you a million examples of that because they are everywhere, but  here's the most amusing one we've seen recently.  It happened yesterday.</p><p> This is MSNBC's resident genius Nicolle Wallace mistaking the opening of a  soda can for gunfire.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NICOLLE WALLACE, \"MSNBC\" HOST, \"DEADLINE:  WHITE HOUSE\":  Steve Smith, I  always go back to the horror of 9/11 and the complete reliance - we're in  our tribes.  We're in our corners most of our lives.  I think we just heard  some gunshots.  Should we listen to that for a second, control room?   That's not a gun shot.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Not gunshots?  No, Nicolle, not gunshots.  Pretty funny.  But be  certain to listen very carefully if she lectures about the Second Amendment  because she knows a lot about it.</p><p> Pete Hegseth is \"Fox &amp; friends\" weekend host.  He is a former member of the  US military, a decorated one, and he joins us tonight.</p><p> So, Pete, it's a pretty simple question.  We kind of know the script.  We  know the way these things unfold, how they're analyzed in the press.  We  draw sweeping conclusions from a pretty limited set of facts.  You're not  hearing that tonight.  You're not hearing other channels say toxic  femininity as a threat to America.  Why is that?</p><p> PETE HEGSETH, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" WEEKEND HOST:  Well, of course, you're not  wrong bad guy, Tucker.  Wrong bad guy.</p><p> Female of Iranian descent.  She's a fitness buff.  She's a vegan.  She's a  PETA member.  Not an NRA member.  Not a Trump supporter.  Not a member of  the NRA.  And as a result, doesn't fit the very convenient narrative.  And  as a result, it's silenced, Tucker.</p><p> I mean, it is \"NBC\", \"CBS\" negligent coverage.  \"ABC\" glancing blow.  \"NBC\"  said she's apparently an animal rights activist.  They are moving away from  this as quickly as they can with almost - imagine if it was an NRA member  that did this.  Is he apparently an NRA member or is he actually an NRA  member?</p><p> In this case, apparently an animal rights activists, but no judgment or  blood on the hands of a PETA member.  Always blood on the hands of an NRA  member because it would be absurd to me to define an entire population as  violent because they believe in animal rights, just like it's absurd to  believe an entire population of Second Amendment supporters that believes  in violence because they support our rights.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, I'm a little confused here.  So, what you're suggesting - and  my producer just said in my ear.  He's watching the other channels.  None  of them are covering this right now - that the coverage of gun crimes  really isn't an effort to reduce the number of gun crimes.  It's an effort  to make a series of partisan points.  Is that what you're saying?</p><p> HEGSETH:  It's an effort to impugn the Second Amendment and those who  support it, Tucker.  Ultimately, it all depends on the labels that apply.   You know this.  Identity politics are one-sided.  </p><p> If you're a white Christian male who voted for Donald Trump and believe in  the Second Amendment who owns an AR-15, then you must be - have a  proclivity to violence.</p><p> But you are a female of any other shade who owns a handgun and supports  animals and you commit violence, nothing to see here, turn this channel.   \"Good morning America\", as they did this morning, will not even cover this  deal, this shooting and won't draw a larger narrative as a result.</p><p> Again, apparently an animal rights activist.  This is what the modern media  has turned into, cheerleading for a cause, which is taking away our guns,  which is exactly what we know they want to do as opposed to reporting the  news and then moving on if it's not relevant.</p><p> CARLSON:  It doesn't sound like journalism.  It does seem to me that it  crosses a line when it moves from attacking the president personally - they  don't like Trump.  I get it.  He doesn't like them, by the way.   </p><p> HEGSETH:  Sure.</p><p> CARLSON:  But from that - which you could sort of understand it.  You know  you probably shouldn't do it, but I get it - to moving over to advocating  for specific policies that affect 320 million Americans as if there's only  one side of the debate.</p><p> It moves from childish annoyance to full-on propaganda.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Of course.  I've heard journalists on other networks say it is  our obligation to continue to talk about the Parkland shooting because we  owe it to the American people to keep the conversation alive.</p><p> If we don't talk about it, the conversation doesn't continue and policies  don't change in Washington DC.  If that doesn't sound like activism, I  don't know what is.  </p><p> I mean, it's your job to report the news that is relevant and the shooting  - a mass shooting is, of course, relevant.  You cover it and then you move  on as necessary.  They're deciding what to coverage and dwell on to try to  change -</p><p> CARLSON:  That's right.  But what's so striking is, if you're going to pick  a topic that the media would lobby on, maybe camera angles or lighting,  they sort of makeup - I mean, they're experts on that stuff.  But is there  any group in America that knows less about firearms?  Nicolle Wallace  mistook a soda opening for a gunshot.</p><p> HEGSETH:  I opened my Diet Mountain Dew, which I happen to like, and no one  around here jumped and thought it was an AR-15, let alone a 9 mm.  I mean,  I need Diet Mountain Dew because I'm up at six in the morning like you used  to be.  It keeps us awake.  But I've never mistaken nor would anyone I know  would mistake that as gun fire.</p><p> They they know nothing, Tucker.  How many members of this media are members  of the NRA?  How many of them have ever fired an AR-15, let alone an M4,  which I carry, let alone a 249 squad automatic weapon.</p><p> They don't know a squad automatic weapon from a BB gun, yet they're going  to tell me what I what I can or cannot carry.  Of course, it's political  activism to help their Democratic buddies.</p><p> There is a tank.  It's not convenient.  They're not going to cover it.</p><p> CARLSON:  Who put all the dumb people on TV?  I always ask myself that.   Pete, it's great to see you.  You're not one of them.  And I appreciate  your coming on.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Thank you.</p><p> Well, several tech CEOs responded to the YouTube shooting by demanding that  regular people be deprived off their right to carry firearms.  </p><p> That would include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who tweeted this, \"We can't keep  being reactive to this and thinking and praying it won't happen again in  our schools, jobs, our community spots.  It is beyond time to evolve our  policies.\" He didn't specify which ones, but you know what he was talking  about.  He cares much more than you do.</p><p> Dorsey then endorsed demands issued by the March for our Lives.  Those  would include, again not specific, banning high-capacity magazines,  confiscating all weapons designated as assault weapons.</p><p> Now, what's interesting about all this is that, in 2015, Twitter, the  company he runs, spent more than $68,000 providing, yes, personal security  to Jack Dorsey.  </p><p> Were those guards unarmed?  Right.  No, they weren't.</p><p> Joel Payne is former director of African-American advertising for Hillary  Clinton's 2016 campaigns and he joins us tonight.  </p><p> Great to see you, Joel.  I appreciate your coming on.  So, it's hard to  read this as anything else but an effort by the people in charge to bring  more power to themselves, which is what people in charge do kind of  instinctively.  We get the guns.  you don't.  Shut up and obey.  Why is  that not what's happening right now.</p><p> JOEL PAYNE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Tucker, I don't think really think  that's the right way to look at this issue.  And I really enjoyed listening  to your conversation with your colleague a little bit earlier.</p><p> I am interested to here that you guy think that it's funny that someone on  TV in this environment thought that a soda can opening was a gunshot.  You  thought that was funny.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I think it's idiotic.  Just to clarify, I want to say that I  think it's idiotic.  But that studio didn't have gunshots.  It had a soda  opening.</p><p> And my point is that, if you're going to advocate for positions, you have a  moral obligation to learn something about the topic.  And most people who  are doing that haven't bothered to learn.  And that's the problem.</p><p> I'm not in any way denigrating the fear people feel in the face of gunfire.   I'm making fun of people mistaking a Mountain Dew can for gunfire.</p><p> Look, the point is ordinary people are afraid.  You're absolutely right.   We agree on that.  So, why would the people in charge who are protected by  armed security demand that no one else be allowed to protect themselves, if  you see what I mean?</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, I have some frustration towards what I heard from the Twitter  CEO today, but for a different reason.  I don't like this trend that we  have of waiting for gun violence to come to your backyard before you get  worke about it.  I mean, just because it happened at a tech company  yesterday, as you got this letter with all these tech CEOs who decided to  sign on.</p><p> Listen, I was touched recently by gun violence.  I had a very close friend  that was impacted by what happened at the veteran home in California.  But,  guess what, I felt strongly about gun violence and about all of the  concerns around that before that.  It didn't take that issue to pique my  interest.</p><p> By the way, it's interesting, Tucker.  A lot of the people who watch this  show and a lot of people who watch this network feel the same way I do.</p><p> If you look at the polls - </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I feel the same way you do.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CARLSON:  No, no, but hold on.  Let's be honest.  One of the sort of pieces  of political rhetoric that drives me the craziest is the idea that only a  select few care about gun violence.</p><p> I think most people, most normal people are horrified by shootings.  I know  I am.  So, the question is not do you feel deeply about or are you upset.   Of course, you're upset.  The question is what's the most effective  response?  What's the wise thing to do?  That's where the debate is.  It's  not over who cares and who doesn't.  Everybody cares.  I mean, come on now.</p><p> PAYNE:  So, yes, I would turn that question back to you and say, what  should we do?</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I'll give you a perfect example.  So, with the Parkland  shooting, we have a well-documented string of failures by people whose job  it was to protect the kids in that school.  And they didn't.</p><p> There were four armed cops outside - four! - who heard the gunfire and  didn't go in.  I never heard their names mentioned at the March for our  Lives.  I doubt you know their names.  I never heard anybody mention that.</p><p> We hire people to protect those kids.  Seventeen were murdered because they  didn't act, but it's the NRA's fault?  That's insane.  That's just pure  politics.  You're not taking it seriously if you reach that conclusion, I  would say.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.  There were a lot of  people who failed those children that day.  Some of them were the people  who didn't run into those building, but a number were people who were in  the State House in Tallahassee and who were on Capitol Hill in Washington,  D.C.</p><p> They had the chance to act.  You could have acted after Sandy Hook.  You  could have acted after Orlando (ph).  You had so many opportunities to act.</p><p> CARLSON:  You're defending the people in power, as almost everyone in the  left does, the people in power are blameless.  They didn't do anything  wrong.</p><p> It's you out there who've committed no crime whatsoever.  The guns in my  closet, if I had them, would be no threat to anybody, but I have to disarm,  but the cops whose job it was to protect the kids, they're cool.  We can't  blame them.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I didn't say that.  I actually agreed with you.  I said they share  some blame.  I said that the blame didn't end with them, though.  It also  extended to the people who were in Tallahassee at their State Houses and in  Capitol Hill and State Houses all across the country who failed to act.</p><p> CARLSON:  I mean, I take you seriously.  It's why I wanted to talk to you  tonight.  So, just in the minute and a half we have left, just give me a  discreet step, specific step that they could have taken to prevent the  Parkland shooting, for example.</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, let's look at a couple of things.  Why hasn't the president  acted on bump stocks.  I thought he was hot to trot on that.  </p><p> CARLSON:  What does that have to do with Parkland?  Bump stock makes your  rifle less accurate.  See, this is like - you don't know anything about  guns.</p><p> PAYNE:  Here's the problem, though, Tucker.  Your answer here is, well, it  wouldn't stop this specific act.</p><p> CARLSON:  I am asking an honest question, which is what's - </p><p> PAYNE:  We have a gun violence culture.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you're blaming the State House in Tallahassee for our  culture?</p><p> PAYNE:  Actually, I am.  We have a laissez faire culture to gun violence.  </p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  When I asked you an adult question -</p><p> PAYNE:  We have a culture that has accepted that gun violence is something  we can't do anything about when we know we can.</p><p> CARLSON:  I feel it is something we can do something about.  And when armed  guards neglect their duty to protect children, I think we should hold them  accountable.</p><p> You instead shifted the blame from the people who actually had power to  people whose other positions you don't like in the State House,  Republicans.</p><p> I asked then - trying to be rational - what should they have done?  And you  said Trump should ban bump stocks, which had no role in the Parkland  shooting.</p><p> PAYNE:  I didn't finish.  I was going to say a little bit more.  The  president can act on this.  by the way, the NRA, they could be partners  here, right?</p><p> The NRA are running scared.  The reason why you see them turning John Paul  Stevens and a bunch of 17 year olds into boogeymen is because they know  public sentiment is at an all-time low for what they fight for, which is  the right for gun manufacturers to make money.</p><p> CARLSON:  But you're arguing rhetoric and bumper stickers.  I want actual  solutions because, like you, I care.  I want to know what the new law is  that would have prevented Parkland.</p><p> There are a lot of shootings.  Lot of different causes.  I asked for one  specific answer to that one and I got bump stocks and John Paul Stevens.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I can give you more.  </p><p> CARLSON:  How about one.</p><p> PAYNE:  We can restrict access to people who are mentally ill.</p><p> CARLSON:  We already have done that.</p><p> PAYNE:  We can stop terrorists from purchasing guns.  We could have done  that.  Congress wouldn't do that.  You've got Toomey's legislation.  You've  got Manchin's legislation.</p><p> CARLSON:  We already have the laws.</p><p> PAYNE:  You've got Durbin's legislation.  So many people have tried to act  on this, but the intransigence in Washington led by the NRA won't allow it.</p><p> CARLSON:  That's a lie.  If you go buy a gun, it screams people who are  mentally ill.  The authorities, the actual authorities failed to screen  this kid despite the fact everyone knew he was mentally ill.  They didn't  anything.</p><p> PAYNE:  Unfortunately, the majority of Americans and the majority of  Republicans actually disagree with you and the polling reflects that.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  I don't know what to say.  Those are the facts.  Joe, thank  you.  Thank you for coming on.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  I appreciate it.  </p><p> Well, at the top of the show, one of our guests mentioned that \"GMA\" did  not cover the YouTube shooting.  In fact, that show did spend time on the  shooting this morning over the course of a couple of hours.  We wanted to  correct that.</p><p> Washington elites are horrified that the president may want to send troops  to guard our border, but they're also horrified that those troops may have  to leave Syria.  It tells you everything about their priorities and we're  going to unpack for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Every once in a while, one of those stories comes along where the  red light goes off and you suddenly understand what's going on just beneath  the surface.  It all makes sense.</p><p> That happened today.  So, the administration recently suggested it wants to  pull American troops out of Syria now that ISIS has been crushed and the  official mission has been achieved.  </p><p> How did Washington react to this, the idea that our troops might come home?   Totally outraged.</p><p> Sen.  Lindsey Graham, the Republican of South Carolina, called that \"the  single worst decision the president could make.\"</p><p> Others imputed darker motives.  A writer called Amy Siskind tweeted this,  \"After our military discussed sending in more troops, Trump suddenly and  unilaterally decides to pull our troops out.  Who does this help (hint:   Putin)!\"</p><p> Unilaterally?  Hilarious.  He's the president.  </p><p> Well, \"CNN\" and \"The Washington Post\", of course, made the same claim.  If  you don't support yet another foreign war with no clear objective or end  date, you're in league with our enemies.  You're unpatriotic.</p><p> They tell us American troops absolutely have to be fighting in Syria.  OK.   You've heard that for years.  But at the same time, they tell us that  American troops absolutely should not be protecting America's own borders.</p><p> The Trump administration has signed an executive order deploying the  National Guard to the Mexican border, part of an effort to halt illegal  immigration.  </p><p> The people in charge, all of them, hate this idea.  It's illegal, they say.   The Congressional Hispanic Caucus issued a statement today saying, that's  wasteful.  Of course, that's not their real concern.  Obviously.  </p><p> According to one \"NBC\" analyst, it \"carries the noxious whiff of military  rule.\" </p><p> So, at the very least, these two stories juxtaposed to each other, butted  back-to-back are clarifying.  In the eyes of the geniuses in charge, our  military does not exist for national defense.  You thought otherwise?  They  don't think that.</p><p> Our military, they believe, exists only for the defense of other countries.   In recent years, we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping  Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Libya.  Other countries protect their borders.   That's great, said the panel on the \"Morning Joe\".</p><p> But defending our own borders is a crime against humanity.  Your son is  welcome to die in Syria, as one American soldier already has.  That's  patriotic.  But defending America?  Totally and completely immoral.  Who  put these people in charge exactly?  You know exactly what they think of  the country.  Not much.</p><p> David Tafuri is a former State Department official.  He joins us now.  Now,  David, these two stories really tell you everything.  You have people -  bipartisan, it's not just Democrats at all - saying we have a moral  obligation to keep the borders of Syria intact.</p><p> We don't want unauthorized people coming into Syria - the Kurds, the  Persians - we've got to keep them out.  But to use our military to protect  our borders, that's the whiff of military rule.  It's immoral.  How does  that work?</p><p> DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, that's not why we  have US soldiers in Syria.  It's not to protect the borders.  It's  primarily to fight terrorism.  In fact, to fight ISIS.</p><p> I was just in Iraq three weeks ago again.  When I saw there, what I saw is  that ISIS is almost defeated.  It's lost its territory in Iraq.  It's lost  its territory in Syria.  But remember it was created out of Syria.  So,  it's a precarious situation.</p><p> Moreover, the fundamental reasons why ISIS came into being are not gone  yet.  There are still divisions in Iraq, divisions in Syria, problems with  the government that created ISIS.  And, therefore, we need to be there to  finish the job with ISIS.</p><p> CARLSON:  But, actually, did the US government and or our 2,000 troops or  the Assad government do more to fight ISIS?  Oh, wait.  Let me answer that  question.  I know that Nikki Haley is telling us it's a living hell and  Assad is Satan.  But, actually, bad guy; did a lot to fight ISIS.  I mean,  let's be honest about that.</p><p> TAFURI:  He's done little to fight ISIS.</p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, OK.</p><p> TAFURI:  In fact, many think that's he's also party responsible for letting  ISIS be there because it's a convenient foe to have.</p><p> CARLSON:  Who are the who think that?</p><p> TAFURI:  But let's go back to Trump's policy on Syria because it started  quite well.  In February, 2017, he does air strikes on Assad because Assad  used chemical weapons.</p><p> It looked like he was going to actually diverge -</p><p> CARLSON:  I don't think that's true.  That's never been proved.</p><p> TAFURI:  That's absolutely been proven.</p><p> CARLSON:  No.  It actually has not been proven.  We had no one on the  ground to verify that as of the moment that we sent airstrikes into Syria  in retaliation.  We didn't.  No American verified that.  I don't know that  we know that's true.</p><p> It's like one of these things that all smart people - oh, it's true.  Are  you unpatriotic?  Are you for Putin?  No, I don't believe that's true  actually.</p><p> TAFURI:  Tucker, all of the reporting from the ground -</p><p> CARLSON:  There was no reporting from the ground.</p><p> TAFURI:  And including doctors who examined the victims of Assad, said it's  true.</p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, American doctors.</p><p> TAFURI:  President Trump and the Republican administration believed it was  true.  That's why they did airstrikes.</p><p> CARLSON:  I couldn't agree more.  And I was skeptical when that happened  because my job is not to ratify every decision Trump makes, but to explain  what, I think, is right for our country.</p><p> So, why is it we sent 2,000 troops into Syria in the middle of a conflict  we don't even understand, but it's immoral to send them to keep the  invasion on our southern border from continuing into our country, how does  that work?</p><p> TAFURI:  Let's talk about Syria first and then we'll about -</p><p> CARLSON:  We're almost out of time.</p><p> TAFURI:  So, the troops are in Syria for very important reasons.  Remember,  these are special forces troops.  So, they're not doing all of the  fighting.  They're some of our best fighters, but they're also training the  indigenous forces in Syria and they made a lot of progress working with the  Syrian Kurds.</p><p> And the Syrian Kurds are our friends.  And the Syrian Kurds have put their  lives on the line to fight ISIS with us.  And if we pull out suddenly,  we're leaving them to be -</p><p> CARLSON:  How about the South Californians who were born in this, including  me.  I'm a native South Californian.  No one is looking out for my interest  because I'm not a Syrian Kurd.</p><p> TAFURI:  You're right.  We have every right to protect our border and  President Trump put forward a border proposal with a budget to Congress in  order to do that.  He failed to push that through.  It was a failure in  leadership.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, where is it immoral to protect our country with our military?</p><p> TAFURI:  It's not immoral.  It is moral to protect our country.  If we have  to, if there's a crisis situation, we should protect our country with our  military.</p><p> CARLSON:  We've got 11 million people living here illegally.  That's not a  crisis?</p><p> TAFURI:  The appropriate force to protect the border is the Border Patrol,  which comes under the Department of Homeland Security.  And President Trump  put forward a proposal to fund them and he should be able to push that  through Congress.</p><p> CARLSON:  The left wants to abolish ICE.</p><p> TAFURI:  He should not treat a situation that's not a crisis as a crisis.</p><p> CARLSON:  Not a crisis.  But Syrian Kurds - I want my son to go fight on  behalf of the Syrian Kurds.</p><p> TAFURI:  ISIS which is responsible for deaths in America and across Europe,  that's who we're fighting.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  I appreciate it.  David, thank you.</p><p> TAFURI:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  On the left, you may have noticed everything is about race.   Everything! Even things that have nothing to do with race.  Most things are  about economics, by the way.  It doesn't matter.  One channel is calling  president a racist for mocking Barack Obama.  Part of a long theme.  We'll  get to it in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, a lot of people hate the president.  So, of course,  everything he does must be motivated by racial animus because racism is  bad.  So, of course, Trump would be a bad racist.</p><p> Yesterday, on CNN, former White House Communications Director Jen Psaki  said that President Trump's Cheatin' Obama nickname was not just weird, it  was racist.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JEN PSAKI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  Given Trump's  history, you can also guess there might be racial undertones there.  He was  the founder of the birther movement.  Perhaps I'm going to a very evil  place with that, but I think history tells us that's a possibility.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  I don't know evil.  Just like weird and confusing.  OK, maybe  it's racist.  How?  Never explained.</p><p> Meanwhile, over at CNN, commentator Tara Setmayer said it's OK to call  black Republicans racial slurs.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRISTOPHER HARRIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNHYPHENATED AMERICA:  It takes  somebody with very thick skin to go out there and be black and say 'I'm a  Republican, I'm a conservative,' because what's going to happen is they're  going to come on your network and they're going to be called everything  (INAUDIBLE), they're going to called an Uncle Tom (EXPLETIVE DELETED) and  everything like that.  </p><p> TARA SETMAYER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  What are you talking about?</p><p> And so, first things first -</p><p> HARRIS:  Are you going to sit there and act like that's not true?</p><p> SETMAYER:  Well, if you act like it and someone calls you out on it, then  we can't do anything about that.  Maybe the messengers need to be better.</p><p> HARRIS:  So it's OK to actually call someone a particular name as long as  you feel like they're acting like that?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p> SETMAYER:  I didn't say that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Poor Don Lemon.  Nice guy.  The show is really unbelievable.  </p><p> Christopher Harris was on it the other night.  He's the man you saw sitting  there.  He is the executive director of Unhyphenated America and he joins  us tonight.</p><p> So, I watched that clip.  And, first, I thought - I felt so bad for you.   But I also thought it was kind of an amazing moment where you basically had  someone defending the use of racial slurs because they're political  expedient.</p><p> HARRIS:  Well, what happened, Tucker, the left showed who they really are.   Of course, Tara calls herself a conservative and a Republican, but, yes -  well, we'll let her say what she wants to say.  </p><p> But at the end of the day, what the left does, they try to put everybody in  a box.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> HARRIS:  And we with Unhyphenated America, what we believe is America is  best when it's unhyphenated.  That if you believe in, if you embrace, if  you understand that - and embrace the principles of life, liberty and the  pursuit of happiness, then you're an American and there's no need for any  prefix or suffix.  You're just an American.</p><p> And so, trying to put everybody into a particular box, saying that you must  think a particular way because of your paint job, as one of my buddies  says, the melanin content in your skin, is one of the problems that the  left has.</p><p> And what they're doing is they're focusing on identity politics.  And they  try to say, well, Donald Trump, obviously, must be a racist because, well,  look at the lack of diversity without kind of doing some critical analysis  and saying, well, how many black people actually applied for a White House  internship.</p><p> And even then, when you look at what exactly what happened with Ms.   Setmayer is that she just vilified any black person who doesn't toe the  lines.</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.  So, what happens - I mean, one of the reasons for the  hysteria, I think, is Trump actually got a higher percentage of the black  vote than the Republican who ran before him - Mitt Romney.  Not a ton, but  more.  So, that freaked them out.</p><p> But what happens to the country long term if you encourage everyone in it,  of all colors, to think of themselves first as members of a racial or  ethnic group.  What happens over time?  </p><p> HARRIS:  Well, balkanization.  The term a lot of people are not familiar  with it.  But the Balkan region, what you have is a lot of different  tribes, different groups of people who are all constantly warring against  each other.</p><p> And one of the things - we are the United States of America.  I mean,  you're maybe a Virginian, or you're a South Carolinian or a Texan, whatever  like that, and so you might have a certain amount of pride for being from  the state that you're from, but at the end of the day we're all Americans.   We have something unifying our culture.</p><p> Once again, it's those beliefs in life, liberty and the pursuit of  happiness and it's one of those things that they keep trying to push these  identity politics to say that you must think a particular way because the  color of your skin.</p><p> But, more importantly, they want you believe - they want me to believe that  because of the color of my skin that I am inherently a victim, that I will  always be a victim and that I should vote a particular way for the people  who, I guess, they want to protect me.</p><p> But we can look at the black community and here's the reality.  What hasn't  gotten better in the past 50 years, as long as blacks have been voting, 70- plus percent for the Democratic Party.</p><p> No one can say that things have gotten better from economic standpoint.   The schools haven't gotten better.  Economically, we're not doing better.   Family-wise, we're not doing better.</p><p> But yet, these are the points that they keep wanting to push with these  identity politics issues and it's just really maddening.</p><p> CARLSON:  Do you think - quickly - that maybe the identity politics is  designed to distract people from thinking about their actual circumstances,  from asking the questions you just raised, which is like, is my life  better, am I making more, is my family better off.</p><p> If they can wave the red flag of race in front of you, maybe you won't  think about those things.  </p><p> HARRIS:  The reality is - I attended McLean Bible Church, which is a huge  church.  It's an ethnically diverse church.  I mean, I always say that the  culture is Christian, but is an ethnically diverse church.  We have over  100 different cultures -  excuse me, ethnicities represented in our church.</p><p> And when you have people interacting one-on-one, there's no real issues of  racism.</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.  And church is the best possible example.  Thank you  very much.  That was great.</p><p> HARRIS:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON:  Google is expanding research efforts in China that could  eventually help the Chinese military overcome the American military.  And  that's terrifyingly the more you learn about it.  The most recent  installment of our \"Tech Tyranny\" series is coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  All this week, we're airing special reports on \"Tech Tyranny\"  looking at how big tech companies are getting more and more power and  endangering a lot of things that we think are important, like democracy and  clear thinking.</p><p> Here's another example.  China's military is obsessed with artificial  intelligence and is investing massive resources into developing an  advantage over our military in artificial intelligence.</p><p> Eric Schmidt chairs Alphabet.  That's the parent company of Google.  He's  admitted that China will soon be the world's leader in AI and they'll use  it for military purposes.  </p><p> He's right.  Maybe.</p><p> Now, Google is dramatically expanding its artificial intelligence research  operations in China, which is bolstering an effort that could eventually  imperil security of this country.</p><p> Paul Scharre is the author of \"Army of None:  Autonomous Weapons and the  Future of War\", which looks like a horrifying book.  I haven't read it yet,  but I plan to.  Paul joins us tonight.</p><p> Thanks, Paul, for coming on.</p><p> PAUL SCHARRE, \"ARMY OF NONE:  AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS AND THE FUTURE OF WAR\"  AUTHOR:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, give us the overview of this.  Did I characterize it fairly,  do you think?</p><p> SCHARRE:  Look, it's not surprising that Google is looking to make research  investments in China.  China has got top-tier AI talent.  Human capital is  key here.  And they've got access to a lot of data.</p><p> China will have 20 percent of the world's data by 2020.  And data is the  fuel that powers machine learning.  </p><p> And so, with a company like Google, they want access to all that data.  So,  they've said, yes, (INAUDIBLE) setting up more research in China.  And that  is concerning for the United States.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, I guess, what I am confused by, so Google describes itself as  a multinational company.  Really, a kind of corporation of the world.</p><p> But it was incubated here.  And everything about Google fundamentally is  American.  It wouldn't have been possible to start Google in China.  And  yet, Google doesn't seem to feel any obligation whatsoever to the US  government or to the American people.  So, how does that work exactly?</p><p> SCHARRE:  Look, this is capitalism.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's disgusting, actually.</p><p> SCHARRE:  These companies are responsible to shareholders.  They're not  accountable to the American people, and so they're going to do what's in  their business interests.</p><p> And if there is a business interest, they move overseas.  They set up  research center to offshore jobs.  They're going to do that.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, American taxpayers subsidize the education of the people who  founded Google and who work there and we create the regulatory and legal  framework possible for it to start.  </p><p> Again, no other company like this has started in Europe, for example.   Certainly not in Asia.  So, we make it possible.  And then, they turn  around and undermine the national security of the country.</p><p> I know that people describe as market capitalism, but that seems immoral to  me.</p><p> SCHARRE:  Look, at the end of the day, we are in a technology race.  And  it's not just China.  It's other countries as well.  </p><p> Vladimir Putin has said whoever controls AI will lead the world.</p><p>France! France just released a new plan on artificial intelligence.  We're  going to have to compete.  We're going to have to make US an attractive  place for people to come and invest and do AI research and found companies  and grow them.  And we're going to have to win this race by being faster  than others.</p><p> CARLSON:  Here's another thing that confuses me.  And since you've covered  it, maybe you've got the answer.  So, companies like Google are big on  importing talent.  You and I understand why.  And they argue that we just  don't have enough engineers, for example.  So, we need to bring them in on  H1B visas.</p><p> Is there any thought by the billionaires who run these companies, hey,  maybe we should take some of our billions and invest in American education.   This country isn't producing an adequate number of scientists.  Maybe we  can help with that.  Or because they feel no obligation to the country,  only to their shareholders.  They don't feel that?</p><p> SCHARRE:  I think some of these leaders do.  You see Eric Schmidt, the  former chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent company was part of the  Defense Department's Innovation Advisory Board.</p><p> He has been very active in talking to people at the Pentagon about how the  United States can retain its leadership in artificial intelligence.</p><p> So, some of these leaders care.</p><p> CARLSON:  Really?  Because Andrew Carnegie put a library in every town in  America once he got rich here.  I don't see any of these guys giving back  really in any way to the country.  They seem just to be taking from it.   Only left wing.</p><p> SCHARRE:  I think a lot of them could do more, right?  And more  philanthropy from billionaires would be great.  Yes.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  It would be great.  And we should demand it because this  country made their fortunes possible.  I think.  Paul, thank you for coming  on.  I appreciate it.</p><p> Hillary Clinton says the NRA, Russia, sexism, a ton of other things, all  are to blame for her defeat in 2016.  A lot of you are going to think why  is she still talking like this?  Is she OK?  A sincere question.  Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  It's been nearly 18 months - we've been keeping track - and  Hillary Clinton's blame train is not even close to running out of fuel.   It's getting concerning.</p><p> Well, speaking on Tuesday night at the Wing, which is a women-only club in  New York - because it's women-only, it's not sexist - Clinton began blaming  everybody to the NRA to misogyny itself for her defeat in the 2016  election.  Here's part of it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, LOST TO DONALD TRUMP IN 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION:   Before the Comey letter, I was ahead.  I got more votes than anybody in  history except one term of President Obama.</p><p> Every day that goes by, more evidence, more proof about fake news and the  Russians and Cambridge Analytica, misogyny and sexism.</p><p> I've taken on the NRA for years.  And they've spent more money against me  than they've ever spent against anybody.  And now, we know the Russians  paid for some of it.  Paid for actors who are Russian agents, personnel to  dress up in those very attractive jail outfits and go around in a mock jail  where people could yell, lock her up.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  We know who's on MSNBC's website at midnight every night.  That's  not a political speech.  That was more like group therapy.</p><p> And honestly, the easy thing would be to make fun of Hillary Clinton.   \"Ooh, she's so wrong.\"</p><p> But it's past that.  This is sad.  Will anyone help her?  She is crying out  for?  Where are her friends?  Her husband?  The DNC?  It's like watching  someone you know fall apart.  It's poignant and tragic.  And someone ought  to help.</p><p> Tammy Bruce is a radio host and she joins us tonight.  Tammy, I'm only half  joking.  Whatever else this is, this is not empowering for women.  As the  father of three daughters, I can say that conclusively.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE PRESIDENT:  Right.  And, look, I  mean, there is a point where you never think you'd say this, but you do  begin to feel sorry for her.</p><p> And as a political person, look, a part of what her complaint was at that  event was that Fox News is trying to \"impeach her.\" In other words that  there's coverage of her on this network.  </p><p> There's actually - interestingly, of course, the complaints have come from  other Democrats across the networks, people who actually work for her  campaign.</p><p> But she is in a unique opportunity here - in a unique position where since  she is getting coverage and she clearly is searching for relevance, she  could talk about policy.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> BRUCE:  She could use this so that we would actually be discussing an  argument that she could be having about -</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, that's such a smart point.</p><p> BRUCE:  And also, frankly, maybe then she would be on the Tucker Carlson  show and you could have this conversation.</p><p> CARLSON:  Because actually she knows a lot.  She's not stupid.  And she's  been around a long time and she - her claim to fame always was I've read  the policies, only I've - and there's some truth in that actually and she  could be doing that, but she's not.</p><p> BRUCE:  She's been in the White House.  She's obviously been in the Senate.   She's been the Secretary of State.  And yet, this has devolved into this  group therapy dynamic where she's going over the same complaints that  people there in that group, maybe they've read her book, they know what her  complaints are, but she's also then inserting news of the day, like now  suddenly it's the Cambridge Analytica and it's the NRA because that's the  news that's happening now.</p><p> At this point, it's almost as though she's on an episode of intervention  where people really should try to get her into the van to get her to the  plane, to get her to the place where she can find some peace because it  does get to a point where that's a real - it's almost an abdication of a  responsibility she could have to all of her fans and supporters to really  deal seriously with the issues because they too want solutions.</p><p> And she's still, with this great attention internationally, is not using  the platform she has to present those solutions.  And it's sad and I think  that there could be - even though I would disagree with her solutions, we  at least then could move forward on these issues and try to make a  difference.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, that's exactly right.  We could add to the sum total of the  conversation, which I think is important, even if you disagree.  And we try  to do it every night.</p><p> By the way, that's her speaking live.  We actually don't have a huge desire  to cover everything Hillary Clinton despite her claim, but I think it's  interesting - and can I speak one other point?</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p> CARLSON:  The irony which people are not kind of perceiving is that her  party has moved very far from where she was.  We all long for a time when  Hillary Clinton was the most radical person in the Democratic Party.  And  she's way too moderate for Democrats by and large right now.</p><p> BRUCE:  And that actually is an interesting position she could be in.  In  arguing the things that she and her husband used to represent, which was  balanced budgets and getting people off of welfare and into work and all of  that, I mean, if she wanted to be serious, that's what she could be doing.</p><p> Arguments about how to improve the quality of women's lives.  You could  argue that - she says nobody else has been attacked like her and nobody  else was told to go away like she's been told to go away.</p><p> But Al Gore and John McCain and John Kerry actually continue to talk about  policy.  We can disagree with what they stood for, but as a woman, I think  that there are so many other opportunities with the platform she has.  And  her own party is saying, enough is enough at this point.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  If one of my kids acted like that, I'd be very upset.</p><p> Really quickly, so Christian privilege, this is a new category.  A seminar  at George Washington University here in Washington will examine how  Christians get \"unmerited perks\" and have built-in advantages over  everybody else in America.  </p><p> If you actually look at the numbers, Christians are not - anyway, are  actually not thriving in this country.  This is all measured.  But what do  you make of this?  To say this out loud, it seems like a change.</p><p> BRUCE:  Well, I don't identify as a Christian.  I believe in God.  I  believe that Jesus is the guy.  I think it's a very serious thing to  identify as a Christian.  And so, I'm taking it seriously and slowly.  </p><p> But as looking from the outside, what I see as a political commentator and  analyst is Christians maybe have a privilege of being persecuted and  attacked and martyred around the world.  I mean, it is a remarkable attack  dynamic.  Even here at home.</p><p> CARLSON:  I know.</p><p> BRUCE:  Facebook tried to apologize for refusing a Catholic university's ad  that features Jesus on the cross because it was too violent.</p><p> Remember the Chick-fil-A controversy, the so-called controversy, because of  its owner being a Christian man.</p><p> Even the attacks that Billy Graham at his death went under because of his  Christian faith.  So, there's no privilege except I think to be mocked.  </p><p> CARLSON:  There isn't.  Tammy Bruce, great to see you.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Up next, reflecting our commitment to hard news, zombie racoons.   Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Youngstown, Ohio was living in a state of fear tonight.  That  city has survived de-industrialization, crime, opioids.  Now it faces an  even more profound threat, zombie raccoons.  </p><p> In the past week, Youngstown police have responded to more than a dozen  calls of bizarre behavior during the day by these ordinarily nocturnal  critters.  </p><p> No one has captured this on camera yet.  So, imagine the raccoon in this  file video as a zombie.  </p><p> According to one eyewitness, a raccoon has walked up to him as he walked  his dog, reared up on its hind legs and then poised to attack, abruptly  fell back as though having a seizure.  </p><p> According to authorities, this isn't a virus.

Apparently, Aghdam  believed that YouTube's content policies have somehow sabotaged her efforts  to become a digital video star.  Enraged, she drove to the company's  headquarters and opened fire.  That's what we know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now, let's pause for a moment and pretend this is not the 8 p.m.  show on  Fox News.  Let's pretend it's somewhere else on the dial.  Maybe \"CNN\" or  \"MSNBC\" or actually any other cable channel or newspaper in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> If that were true, by definition, we'd have to draw hard-and-fast  conclusions from this tragedy using the limited facts that are available.   We don't really know much at this stage, but sweeping dumb generalizations  are what the media do.  We would do that.  And, of course, we'd need a very  specific script in order to make those generalizations.</p><p> So, what do we conclude from what happened yesterday?  Well, first off, the  shooter was a woman.  She was female.  So, clearly, America has a problem  with toxic feminity.  And we need to address that crisis right away,  starting with more university panel shaming an entire gender.  Somebody  alert the HR department to this.</p><p> And then, there is the gun.  We focus relentlessly on the gun because  nothing is more pivotal in a shooting than the weapon that was used.  It's  always the gun's fault.  Always.</p><p> The shooter in this case used a Smith &amp; Wesson 9 mm handgun.  Those guns  need to be banned tomorrow, along with all other assault pistols.  Now, if  you disagree with that, you're evil.</p><p> Next, the shooter was a vegan and a supporter of PETA.  Therefore, PETA is  now a terrorist organization.  Anyone who supports PETA, even though  supporters who disapprove of mass shootings, is a monster and has blood on  his hands.</p><p> Let's hope that \"CNN\" hosts a town hall meeting where YouTube employees can  scream at PETA spokesman.  They deserved to be screaned at.  They caused  the shooting.</p><p> But, wait, media outlets aren't reaching any of those conclusions.  Why  not?  Well, because there's no obvious way to use this shooting to advance  the objectives of the Democratic Party.  So, the media will stop talking  about it soon.  That's how corrupt they are.</p><p> They're also incredibly stupid, especially on the subject of firearms.  The  people yelling at you about guns on television aren't sure what end the  bullet comes out.  They're kids.  They're children with all the ignorance  and moral certainty of fifth graders.</p><p> We can show you a million examples of that because they are everywhere, but  here's the most amusing one we've seen recently.  It happened yesterday.</p><p> This is MSNBC's resident genius Nicolle Wallace mistaking the opening of a  soda can for gunfire.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NICOLLE WALLACE, \"MSNBC\" HOST, \"DEADLINE:  WHITE HOUSE\":  Steve Smith, I  always go back to the horror of 9/11 and the complete reliance - we're in  our tribes.  We're in our corners most of our lives.  I think we just heard  some gunshots.  Should we listen to that for a second, control room?   That's not a gun shot.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Not gunshots?  No, Nicolle, not gunshots.  Pretty funny.  But be  certain to listen very carefully if she lectures about the Second Amendment  because she knows a lot about it.</p><p> Pete Hegseth is \"Fox &amp; friends\" weekend host.  He is a former member of the  US military, a decorated one, and he joins us tonight.</p><p> So, Pete, it's a pretty simple question.  We kind of know the script.  We  know the way these things unfold, how they're analyzed in the press.  We  draw sweeping conclusions from a pretty limited set of facts.  You're not  hearing that tonight.  You're not hearing other channels say toxic  femininity as a threat to America.  Why is that?</p><p> PETE HEGSETH, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" WEEKEND HOST:  Well, of course, you're not  wrong bad guy, Tucker.  Wrong bad guy.</p><p> Female of Iranian descent.  She's a fitness buff.  She's a vegan.  She's a  PETA member.  Not an NRA member.  Not a Trump supporter.  Not a member of  the NRA.  And as a result, doesn't fit the very convenient narrative.  And  as a result, it's silenced, Tucker.</p><p> I mean, it is \"NBC\", \"CBS\" negligent coverage.  \"ABC\" glancing blow.  \"NBC\"  said she's apparently an animal rights activist.  They are moving away from  this as quickly as they can with almost - imagine if it was an NRA member  that did this.  Is he apparently an NRA member or is he actually an NRA  member?</p><p> In this case, apparently an animal rights activists, but no judgment or  blood on the hands of a PETA member.  Always blood on the hands of an NRA  member because it would be absurd to me to define an entire population as  violent because they believe in animal rights, just like it's absurd to  believe an entire population of Second Amendment supporters that believes  in violence because they support our rights.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, I'm a little confused here.  So, what you're suggesting - and  my producer just said in my ear.  He's watching the other channels.  None  of them are covering this right now - that the coverage of gun crimes  really isn't an effort to reduce the number of gun crimes.  It's an effort  to make a series of partisan points.  Is that what you're saying?</p><p> HEGSETH:  It's an effort to impugn the Second Amendment and those who  support it, Tucker.  Ultimately, it all depends on the labels that apply.   You know this.  Identity politics are one-sided.  </p><p> If you're a white Christian male who voted for Donald Trump and believe in  the Second Amendment who owns an AR-15, then you must be - have a  proclivity to violence.</p><p> But you are a female of any other shade who owns a handgun and supports  animals and you commit violence, nothing to see here, turn this channel.   \"Good morning America\", as they did this morning, will not even cover this  deal, this shooting and won't draw a larger narrative as a result.</p><p> Again, apparently an animal rights activist.  This is what the modern media  has turned into, cheerleading for a cause, which is taking away our guns,  which is exactly what we know they want to do as opposed to reporting the  news and then moving on if it's not relevant.</p><p> CARLSON:  It doesn't sound like journalism.  It does seem to me that it  crosses a line when it moves from attacking the president personally - they  don't like Trump.  I get it.  He doesn't like them, by the way.   </p><p> HEGSETH:  Sure.</p><p> CARLSON:  But from that - which you could sort of understand it.  You know  you probably shouldn't do it, but I get it - to moving over to advocating  for specific policies that affect 320 million Americans as if there's only  one side of the debate.</p><p> It moves from childish annoyance to full-on propaganda.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Of course.  I've heard journalists on other networks say it is  our obligation to continue to talk about the Parkland shooting because we  owe it to the American people to keep the conversation alive.</p><p> If we don't talk about it, the conversation doesn't continue and policies  don't change in Washington DC.  If that doesn't sound like activism, I  don't know what is.  </p><p> I mean, it's your job to report the news that is relevant and the shooting  - a mass shooting is, of course, relevant.  You cover it and then you move  on as necessary.  They're deciding what to coverage and dwell on to try to  change -</p><p> CARLSON:  That's right.  But what's so striking is, if you're going to pick  a topic that the media would lobby on, maybe camera angles or lighting,  they sort of makeup - I mean, they're experts on that stuff.  But is there  any group in America that knows less about firearms?  Nicolle Wallace  mistook a soda opening for a gunshot.</p><p> HEGSETH:  I opened my Diet Mountain Dew, which I happen to like, and no one  around here jumped and thought it was an AR-15, let alone a 9 mm.  I mean,  I need Diet Mountain Dew because I'm up at six in the morning like you used  to be.  It keeps us awake.  But I've never mistaken nor would anyone I know  would mistake that as gun fire.</p><p> They they know nothing, Tucker.  How many members of this media are members  of the NRA?  How many of them have ever fired an AR-15, let alone an M4,  which I carry, let alone a 249 squad automatic weapon.</p><p> They don't know a squad automatic weapon from a BB gun, yet they're going  to tell me what I what I can or cannot carry.  Of course, it's political  activism to help their Democratic buddies.</p><p> There is a tank.  It's not convenient.  They're not going to cover it.</p><p> CARLSON:  Who put all the dumb people on TV?  I always ask myself that.   Pete, it's great to see you.  You're not one of them.  And I appreciate  your coming on.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Thank you.</p><p> Well, several tech CEOs responded to the YouTube shooting by demanding that  regular people be deprived off their right to carry firearms.  </p><p> That would include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who tweeted this, \"We can't keep  being reactive to this and thinking and praying it won't happen again in  our schools, jobs, our community spots.  It is beyond time to evolve our  policies.\" He didn't specify which ones, but you know what he was talking  about.  He cares much more than you do.</p><p> Dorsey then endorsed demands issued by the March for our Lives.  Those  would include, again not specific, banning high-capacity magazines,  confiscating all weapons designated as assault weapons.</p><p> Now, what's interesting about all this is that, in 2015, Twitter, the  company he runs, spent more than $68,000 providing, yes, personal security  to Jack Dorsey.  </p><p> Were those guards unarmed?  Right.  No, they weren't.</p><p> Joel Payne is former director of African-American advertising for Hillary  Clinton's 2016 campaigns and he joins us tonight.  </p><p> Great to see you, Joel.  I appreciate your coming on.  So, it's hard to  read this as anything else but an effort by the people in charge to bring  more power to themselves, which is what people in charge do kind of  instinctively.  We get the guns.  you don't.  Shut up and obey.  Why is  that not what's happening right now.</p><p> JOEL PAYNE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Tucker, I don't think really think  that's the right way to look at this issue.  And I really enjoyed listening  to your conversation with your colleague a little bit earlier.</p><p> I am interested to here that you guy think that it's funny that someone on  TV in this environment thought that a soda can opening was a gunshot.  You  thought that was funny.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I think it's idiotic.  Just to clarify, I want to say that I  think it's idiotic.  But that studio didn't have gunshots.  It had a soda  opening.</p><p> And my point is that, if you're going to advocate for positions, you have a  moral obligation to learn something about the topic.  And most people who  are doing that haven't bothered to learn.  And that's the problem.</p><p> I'm not in any way denigrating the fear people feel in the face of gunfire.   I'm making fun of people mistaking a Mountain Dew can for gunfire.</p><p> Look, the point is ordinary people are afraid.  You're absolutely right.   We agree on that.  So, why would the people in charge who are protected by  armed security demand that no one else be allowed to protect themselves, if  you see what I mean?</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, I have some frustration towards what I heard from the Twitter  CEO today, but for a different reason.  I don't like this trend that we  have of waiting for gun violence to come to your backyard before you get  worke about it.  I mean, just because it happened at a tech company  yesterday, as you got this letter with all these tech CEOs who decided to  sign on.</p><p> Listen, I was touched recently by gun violence.  I had a very close friend  that was impacted by what happened at the veteran home in California.  But,  guess what, I felt strongly about gun violence and about all of the  concerns around that before that.  It didn't take that issue to pique my  interest.</p><p> By the way, it's interesting, Tucker.  A lot of the people who watch this  show and a lot of people who watch this network feel the same way I do.</p><p> If you look at the polls - </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I feel the same way you do.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CARLSON:  No, no, but hold on.  Let's be honest.  One of the sort of pieces  of political rhetoric that drives me the craziest is the idea that only a  select few care about gun violence.</p><p> I think most people, most normal people are horrified by shootings.  I know  I am.  So, the question is not do you feel deeply about or are you upset.   Of course, you're upset.  The question is what's the most effective  response?  What's the wise thing to do?  That's where the debate is.  It's  not over who cares and who doesn't.  Everybody cares.  I mean, come on now.</p><p> PAYNE:  So, yes, I would turn that question back to you and say, what  should we do?</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I'll give you a perfect example.  So, with the Parkland  shooting, we have a well-documented string of failures by people whose job  it was to protect the kids in that school.  And they didn't.</p><p> There were four armed cops outside - four! - who heard the gunfire and  didn't go in.  I never heard their names mentioned at the March for our  Lives.  I doubt you know their names.  I never heard anybody mention that.</p><p> We hire people to protect those kids.  Seventeen were murdered because they  didn't act, but it's the NRA's fault?  That's insane.  That's just pure  politics.  You're not taking it seriously if you reach that conclusion, I  would say.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.  There were a lot of  people who failed those children that day.  Some of them were the people  who didn't run into those building, but a number were people who were in  the State House in Tallahassee and who were on Capitol Hill in Washington,  D.C.</p><p> They had the chance to act.  You could have acted after Sandy Hook.  You  could have acted after Orlando (ph).  You had so many opportunities to act.</p><p> CARLSON:  You're defending the people in power, as almost everyone in the  left does, the people in power are blameless.  They didn't do anything  wrong.</p><p> It's you out there who've committed no crime whatsoever.  The guns in my  closet, if I had them, would be no threat to anybody, but I have to disarm,  but the cops whose job it was to protect the kids, they're cool.  We can't  blame them.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I didn't say that.  I actually agreed with you.  I said they share  some blame.  I said that the blame didn't end with them, though.  It also  extended to the people who were in Tallahassee at their State Houses and in  Capitol Hill and State Houses all across the country who failed to act.</p><p> CARLSON:  I mean, I take you seriously.  It's why I wanted to talk to you  tonight.  So, just in the minute and a half we have left, just give me a  discreet step, specific step that they could have taken to prevent the  Parkland shooting, for example.</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, let's look at a couple of things.  Why hasn't the president  acted on bump stocks.  I thought he was hot to trot on that.  </p><p> CARLSON:  What does that have to do with Parkland?  Bump stock makes your  rifle less accurate.  See, this is like - you don't know anything about  guns.</p><p> PAYNE:  Here's the problem, though, Tucker.  Your answer here is, well, it  wouldn't stop this specific act.</p><p> CARLSON:  I am asking an honest question, which is what's - </p><p> PAYNE:  We have a gun violence culture.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you're blaming the State House in Tallahassee for our  culture?</p><p> PAYNE:  Actually, I am.  We have a laissez faire culture to gun violence.  </p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  When I asked you an adult question -</p><p> PAYNE:  We have a culture that has accepted that gun violence is something  we can't do anything about when we know we can.</p><p> CARLSON:  I feel it is something we can do something about.  And when armed  guards neglect their duty to protect children, I think we should hold them  accountable.</p><p> You instead shifted the blame from the people who actually had power to  people whose other positions you don't like in the State House,  Republicans.</p><p> I asked then - trying to be rational - what should they have done?  And you  said Trump should ban bump stocks, which had no role in the Parkland  shooting.</p><p> PAYNE:  I didn't finish.  I was going to say a little bit more.  The  president can act on this.  by the way, the NRA, they could be partners  here, right?</p><p> The NRA are running scared.  The reason why you see them turning John Paul  Stevens and a bunch of 17 year olds into boogeymen is because they know  public sentiment is at an all-time low for what they fight for, which is  the right for gun manufacturers to make money.</p><p> CARLSON:  But you're arguing rhetoric and bumper stickers.  I want actual  solutions because, like you, I care.  I want to know what the new law is  that would have prevented Parkland.</p><p> There are a lot of shootings.  Lot of different causes.  I asked for one  specific answer to that one and I got bump stocks and John Paul Stevens.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I can give you more.  </p><p> CARLSON:  How about one.</p><p> PAYNE:  We can restrict access to people who are mentally ill.</p><p> CARLSON:  We already have done that.</p><p> PAYNE:  We can stop terrorists from purchasing guns.  We could have done  that.  Congress wouldn't do that.  You've got Toomey's legislation.  You've  got Manchin's legislation.</p><p> CARLSON:  We already have the laws.</p><p> PAYNE:  You've got Durbin's legislation.  So many people have tried to act  on this, but the intransigence in Washington led by the NRA won't allow it.</p><p> CARLSON:  That's a lie.  If you go buy a gun, it screams people who are  mentally ill.  The authorities, the actual authorities failed to screen  this kid despite the fact everyone knew he was mentally ill.  They didn't  anything.</p><p> PAYNE:  Unfortunately, the majority of Americans and the majority of  Republicans actually disagree with you and the polling reflects that.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  I don't know what to say.  Those are the facts.  Joe, thank  you.  Thank you for coming on.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  I appreciate it.  </p><p> Well, at the top of the show, one of our guests mentioned that \"GMA\" did  not cover the YouTube shooting.  In fact, that show did spend time on the  shooting this morning over the course of a couple of hours.  We wanted to  correct that.</p><p> Washington elites are horrified that the president may want to send troops  to guard our border, but they're also horrified that those troops may have  to leave Syria.  It tells you everything about their priorities and we're  going to unpack for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Every once in a while, one of those stories comes along where the  red light goes off and you suddenly understand what's going on just beneath  the surface.  It all makes sense.</p><p> That happened today.  So, the administration recently suggested it wants to  pull American troops out of Syria now that ISIS has been crushed and the  official mission has been achieved.  </p><p> How did Washington react to this, the idea that our troops might come home?   Totally outraged.</p><p> Sen.  Lindsey Graham, the Republican of South Carolina, called that \"the  single worst decision the president could make.\"</p><p> Others imputed darker motives.  A writer called Amy Siskind tweeted this,  \"After our military discussed sending in more troops, Trump suddenly and  unilaterally decides to pull our troops out.  Who does this help (hint:   Putin)!\"</p><p> Unilaterally?  Hilarious.  He's the president.  </p><p> Well, \"CNN\" and \"The Washington Post\", of course, made the same claim.  If  you don't support yet another foreign war with no clear objective or end  date, you're in league with our enemies.  You're unpatriotic.</p><p> They tell us American troops absolutely have to be fighting in Syria.  OK.   You've heard that for years.  But at the same time, they tell us that  American troops absolutely should not be protecting America's own borders.</p><p> The Trump administration has signed an executive order deploying the  National Guard to the Mexican border, part of an effort to halt illegal  immigration.  </p><p> The people in charge, all of them, hate this idea.  It's illegal, they say.   The Congressional Hispanic Caucus issued a statement today saying, that's  wasteful.  Of course, that's not their real concern.  Obviously.  </p><p> According to one \"NBC\" analyst, it \"carries the noxious whiff of military  rule.\" </p><p> So, at the very least, these two stories juxtaposed to each other, butted  back-to-back are clarifying.  In the eyes of the geniuses in charge, our  military does not exist for national defense.  You thought otherwise?  They  don't think that.</p><p> Our military, they believe, exists only for the defense of other countries.   In recent years, we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping  Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Libya.  Other countries protect their borders.   That's great, said the panel on the \"Morning Joe\".</p><p> But defending our own borders is a crime against humanity.  Your son is  welcome to die in Syria, as one American soldier already has.  That's  patriotic.  But defending America?  Totally and completely immoral.  Who  put these people in charge exactly?  You know exactly what they think of  the country.  Not much.</p><p> David Tafuri is a former State Department official.  He joins us now.  Now,  David, these two stories really tell you everything.  You have people -  bipartisan, it's not just Democrats at all - saying we have a moral  obligation to keep the borders of Syria intact.</p><p> We don't want unauthorized people coming into Syria - the Kurds, the  Persians - we've got to keep them out.  But to use our military to protect  our borders, that's the whiff of military rule.  It's immoral.  How does  that work?</p><p> DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, that's not why we  have US soldiers in Syria.  It's not to protect the borders.  It's  primarily to fight terrorism.  In fact, to fight ISIS.</p><p> I was just in Iraq three weeks ago again.  When I saw there, what I saw is  that ISIS is almost defeated.  It's lost its territory in Iraq.  It's lost  its territory in Syria.  But remember it was created out of Syria.  So,  it's a precarious situation.</p><p> Moreover, the fundamental reasons why ISIS came into being are not gone  yet.  There are still divisions in Iraq, divisions in Syria, problems with  the government that created ISIS.  And, therefore, we need to be there to  finish the job with ISIS.</p><p> CARLSON:  But, actually, did the US government and or our 2,000 troops or  the Assad government do more to fight ISIS?  Oh, wait.  Let me answer that  question.  I know that Nikki Haley is telling us it's a living hell and  Assad is Satan.  But, actually, bad guy; did a lot to fight ISIS.  I mean,  let's be honest about that.</p><p> TAFURI:  He's done little to fight ISIS.</p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, OK.</p><p> TAFURI:  In fact, many think that's he's also party responsible for letting  ISIS be there because it's a convenient foe to have.</p><p> CARLSON:  Who are the who think that?</p><p> TAFURI:  But let's go back to Trump's policy on Syria because it started  quite well.  In February, 2017, he does air strikes on Assad because Assad  used chemical weapons.</p><p> It looked like he was going to actually diverge -</p><p> CARLSON:  I don't think that's true.  That's never been proved.</p><p> TAFURI:  That's absolutely been proven.</p><p> CARLSON:  No.  It actually has not been proven.  We had no one on the  ground to verify that as of the moment that we sent airstrikes into Syria  in retaliation.  We didn't.  No American verified that.  I don't know that  we know that's true.</p><p> It's like one of these things that all smart people - oh, it's true.  Are  you unpatriotic?  Are you for Putin?  No, I don't believe that's true  actually.</p><p> TAFURI:  Tucker, all of the reporting from the ground -</p><p> CARLSON:  There was no reporting from the ground.</p><p> TAFURI:  And including doctors who examined the victims of Assad, said it's  true.</p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, American doctors.</p><p> TAFURI:  President Trump and the Republican administration believed it was  true.  That's why they did airstrikes.</p><p> CARLSON:  I couldn't agree more.  And I was skeptical when that happened  because my job is not to ratify every decision Trump makes, but to explain  what, I think, is right for our country.</p><p> So, why is it we sent 2,000 troops into Syria in the middle of a conflict  we don't even understand, but it's immoral to send them to keep the  invasion on our southern border from continuing into our country, how does  that work?</p><p> TAFURI:  Let's talk about Syria first and then we'll about -</p><p> CARLSON:  We're almost out of time.</p><p> TAFURI:  So, the troops are in Syria for very important reasons.  Remember,  these are special forces troops.  So, they're not doing all of the  fighting.  They're some of our best fighters, but they're also training the  indigenous forces in Syria and they made a lot of progress working with the  Syrian Kurds.</p><p> And the Syrian Kurds are our friends.  And the Syrian Kurds have put their  lives on the line to fight ISIS with us.  And if we pull out suddenly,  we're leaving them to be -</p><p> CARLSON:  How about the South Californians who were born in this, including  me.  I'm a native South Californian.  No one is looking out for my interest  because I'm not a Syrian Kurd.</p><p> TAFURI:  You're right.  We have every right to protect our border and  President Trump put forward a border proposal with a budget to Congress in  order to do that.  He failed to push that through.  It was a failure in  leadership.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, where is it immoral to protect our country with our military?</p><p> TAFURI:  It's not immoral.  It is moral to protect our country.  If we have  to, if there's a crisis situation, we should protect our country with our  military.</p><p> CARLSON:  We've got 11 million people living here illegally.  That's not a  crisis?</p><p> TAFURI:  The appropriate force to protect the border is the Border Patrol,  which comes under the Department of Homeland Security.  And President Trump  put forward a proposal to fund them and he should be able to push that  through Congress.</p><p> CARLSON:  The left wants to abolish ICE.</p><p> TAFURI:  He should not treat a situation that's not a crisis as a crisis.</p><p> CARLSON:  Not a crisis.  But Syrian Kurds - I want my son to go fight on  behalf of the Syrian Kurds.</p><p> TAFURI:  ISIS which is responsible for deaths in America and across Europe,  that's who we're fighting.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  I appreciate it.  David, thank you.</p><p> TAFURI:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  On the left, you may have noticed everything is about race.   Everything! Even things that have nothing to do with race.  Most things are  about economics, by the way.  It doesn't matter.  One channel is calling  president a racist for mocking Barack Obama.  Part of a long theme.  We'll  get to it in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, a lot of people hate the president.  So, of course,  everything he does must be motivated by racial animus because racism is  bad.  So, of course, Trump would be a bad racist.</p><p> Yesterday, on CNN, former White House Communications Director Jen Psaki  said that President Trump's Cheatin' Obama nickname was not just weird, it  was racist.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JEN PSAKI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  Given Trump's  history, you can also guess there might be racial undertones there.  He was  the founder of the birther movement.  Perhaps I'm going to a very evil  place with that, but I think history tells us that's a possibility.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  I don't know evil.  Just like weird and confusing.  OK, maybe  it's racist.  How?  Never explained.</p><p> Meanwhile, over at CNN, commentator Tara Setmayer said it's OK to call  black Republicans racial slurs.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRISTOPHER HARRIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNHYPHENATED AMERICA:  It takes  somebody with very thick skin to go out there and be black and say 'I'm a  Republican, I'm a conservative,' because what's going to happen is they're  going to come on your network and they're going to be called everything  (INAUDIBLE), they're going to called an Uncle Tom (EXPLETIVE DELETED) and  everything like that.  </p><p> TARA SETMAYER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  What are you talking about?</p><p> And so, first things first -</p><p> HARRIS:  Are you going to sit there and act like that's not true?</p><p> SETMAYER:  Well, if you act like it and someone calls you out on it, then  we can't do anything about that.  Maybe the messengers need to be better.</p><p> HARRIS:  So it's OK to actually call someone a particular name as long as  you feel like they're acting like that?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p> SETMAYER:  I didn't say that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Poor Don Lemon.  Nice guy.  The show is really unbelievable.  </p><p> Christopher Harris was on it the other night.  He's the man you saw sitting  there.  He is the executive director of Unhyphenated America and he joins  us tonight.</p><p> So, I watched that clip.  And, first, I thought - I felt so bad for you.   But I also thought it was kind of an amazing moment where you basically had  someone defending the use of racial slurs because they're political  expedient.</p><p> HARRIS:  Well, what happened, Tucker, the left showed who they really are.   Of course, Tara calls herself a conservative and a Republican, but, yes -  well, we'll let her say what she wants to say.  </p><p> But at the end of the day, what the left does, they try to put everybody in  a box.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> HARRIS:  And we with Unhyphenated America, what we believe is America is  best when it's unhyphenated.  That if you believe in, if you embrace, if  you understand that - and embrace the principles of life, liberty and the  pursuit of happiness, then you're an American and there's no need for any  prefix or suffix.  You're just an American.</p><p> And so, trying to put everybody into a particular box, saying that you must  think a particular way because of your paint job, as one of my buddies  says, the melanin content in your skin, is one of the problems that the  left has.</p><p> And what they're doing is they're focusing on identity politics.  And they  try to say, well, Donald Trump, obviously, must be a racist because, well,  look at the lack of diversity without kind of doing some critical analysis  and saying, well, how many black people actually applied for a White House  internship.</p><p> And even then, when you look at what exactly what happened with Ms.   Setmayer is that she just vilified any black person who doesn't toe the  lines.</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.  So, what happens - I mean, one of the reasons for the  hysteria, I think, is Trump actually got a higher percentage of the black  vote than the Republican who ran before him - Mitt Romney.  Not a ton, but  more.  So, that freaked them out.</p><p> But what happens to the country long term if you encourage everyone in it,  of all colors, to think of themselves first as members of a racial or  ethnic group.  What happens over time?  </p><p> HARRIS:  Well, balkanization.  The term a lot of people are not familiar  with it.  But the Balkan region, what you have is a lot of different  tribes, different groups of people who are all constantly warring against  each other.</p><p> And one of the things - we are the United States of America.  I mean,  you're maybe a Virginian, or you're a South Carolinian or a Texan, whatever  like that, and so you might have a certain amount of pride for being from  the state that you're from, but at the end of the day we're all Americans.   We have something unifying our culture.</p><p> Once again, it's those beliefs in life, liberty and the pursuit of  happiness and it's one of those things that they keep trying to push these  identity politics to say that you must think a particular way because the  color of your skin.</p><p> But, more importantly, they want you believe - they want me to believe that  because of the color of my skin that I am inherently a victim, that I will  always be a victim and that I should vote a particular way for the people  who, I guess, they want to protect me.</p><p> But we can look at the black community and here's the reality.  What hasn't  gotten better in the past 50 years, as long as blacks have been voting, 70- plus percent for the Democratic Party.</p><p> No one can say that things have gotten better from economic standpoint.   The schools haven't gotten better.  Economically, we're not doing better.   Family-wise, we're not doing better.</p><p> But yet, these are the points that they keep wanting to push with these  identity politics issues and it's just really maddening.</p><p> CARLSON:  Do you think - quickly - that maybe the identity politics is  designed to distract people from thinking about their actual circumstances,  from asking the questions you just raised, which is like, is my life  better, am I making more, is my family better off.</p><p> If they can wave the red flag of race in front of you, maybe you won't  think about those things.  </p><p> HARRIS:  The reality is - I attended McLean Bible Church, which is a huge  church.  It's an ethnically diverse church.  I mean, I always say that the  culture is Christian, but is an ethnically diverse church.  We have over  100 different cultures -  excuse me, ethnicities represented in our church.</p><p> And when you have people interacting one-on-one, there's no real issues of  racism.</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.  And church is the best possible example.  Thank you  very much.  That was great.</p><p> HARRIS:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON:  Google is expanding research efforts in China that could  eventually help the Chinese military overcome the American military.  And  that's terrifyingly the more you learn about it.  The most recent  installment of our \"Tech Tyranny\" series is coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  All this week, we're airing special reports on \"Tech Tyranny\"  looking at how big tech companies are getting more and more power and  endangering a lot of things that we think are important, like democracy and  clear thinking.</p><p> Here's another example.  China's military is obsessed with artificial  intelligence and is investing massive resources into developing an  advantage over our military in artificial intelligence.</p><p> Eric Schmidt chairs Alphabet.  That's the parent company of Google.  He's  admitted that China will soon be the world's leader in AI and they'll use  it for military purposes.  </p><p> He's right.  Maybe.</p><p> Now, Google is dramatically expanding its artificial intelligence research  operations in China, which is bolstering an effort that could eventually  imperil security of this country.</p><p> Paul Scharre is the author of \"Army of None:  Autonomous Weapons and the  Future of War\", which looks like a horrifying book.  I haven't read it yet,  but I plan to.  Paul joins us tonight.</p><p> Thanks, Paul, for coming on.</p><p> PAUL SCHARRE, \"ARMY OF NONE:  AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS AND THE FUTURE OF WAR\"  AUTHOR:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, give us the overview of this.  Did I characterize it fairly,  do you think?</p><p> SCHARRE:  Look, it's not surprising that Google is looking to make research  investments in China.  China has got top-tier AI talent.  Human capital is  key here.  And they've got access to a lot of data.</p><p> China will have 20 percent of the world's data by 2020.  And data is the  fuel that powers machine learning.  </p><p> And so, with a company like Google, they want access to all that data.  So,  they've said, yes, (INAUDIBLE) setting up more research in China.  And that  is concerning for the United States.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, I guess, what I am confused by, so Google describes itself as  a multinational company.  Really, a kind of corporation of the world.</p><p> But it was incubated here.  And everything about Google fundamentally is  American.  It wouldn't have been possible to start Google in China.  And  yet, Google doesn't seem to feel any obligation whatsoever to the US  government or to the American people.  So, how does that work exactly?</p><p> SCHARRE:  Look, this is capitalism.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's disgusting, actually.</p><p> SCHARRE:  These companies are responsible to shareholders.  They're not  accountable to the American people, and so they're going to do what's in  their business interests.</p><p> And if there is a business interest, they move overseas.  They set up  research center to offshore jobs.  They're going to do that.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, American taxpayers subsidize the education of the people who  founded Google and who work there and we create the regulatory and legal  framework possible for it to start.  </p><p> Again, no other company like this has started in Europe, for example.   Certainly not in Asia.  So, we make it possible.  And then, they turn  around and undermine the national security of the country.</p><p> I know that people describe as market capitalism, but that seems immoral to  me.</p><p> SCHARRE:  Look, at the end of the day, we are in a technology race.  And  it's not just China.  It's other countries as well.  </p><p> Vladimir Putin has said whoever controls AI will lead the world.</p><p>France! France just released a new plan on artificial intelligence.  We're  going to have to compete.  We're going to have to make US an attractive  place for people to come and invest and do AI research and found companies  and grow them.  And we're going to have to win this race by being faster  than others.</p><p> CARLSON:  Here's another thing that confuses me.  And since you've covered  it, maybe you've got the answer.  So, companies like Google are big on  importing talent.  You and I understand why.  And they argue that we just  don't have enough engineers, for example.  So, we need to bring them in on  H1B visas.</p><p> Is there any thought by the billionaires who run these companies, hey,  maybe we should take some of our billions and invest in American education.   This country isn't producing an adequate number of scientists.  Maybe we  can help with that.  Or because they feel no obligation to the country,  only to their shareholders.  They don't feel that?</p><p> SCHARRE:  I think some of these leaders do.  You see Eric Schmidt, the  former chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent company was part of the  Defense Department's Innovation Advisory Board.</p><p> He has been very active in talking to people at the Pentagon about how the  United States can retain its leadership in artificial intelligence.</p><p> So, some of these leaders care.</p><p> CARLSON:  Really?  Because Andrew Carnegie put a library in every town in  America once he got rich here.  I don't see any of these guys giving back  really in any way to the country.  They seem just to be taking from it.   Only left wing.</p><p> SCHARRE:  I think a lot of them could do more, right?  And more  philanthropy from billionaires would be great.  Yes.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  It would be great.  And we should demand it because this  country made their fortunes possible.  I think.  Paul, thank you for coming  on.  I appreciate it.</p><p> Hillary Clinton says the NRA, Russia, sexism, a ton of other things, all  are to blame for her defeat in 2016.  A lot of you are going to think why  is she still talking like this?  Is she OK?  A sincere question.  Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  It's been nearly 18 months - we've been keeping track - and  Hillary Clinton's blame train is not even close to running out of fuel.   It's getting concerning.</p><p> Well, speaking on Tuesday night at the Wing, which is a women-only club in  New York - because it's women-only, it's not sexist - Clinton began blaming  everybody to the NRA to misogyny itself for her defeat in the 2016  election.  Here's part of it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, LOST TO DONALD TRUMP IN 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION:   Before the Comey letter, I was ahead.  I got more votes than anybody in  history except one term of President Obama.</p><p> Every day that goes by, more evidence, more proof about fake news and the  Russians and Cambridge Analytica, misogyny and sexism.</p><p> I've taken on the NRA for years.  And they've spent more money against me  than they've ever spent against anybody.  And now, we know the Russians  paid for some of it.  Paid for actors who are Russian agents, personnel to  dress up in those very attractive jail outfits and go around in a mock jail  where people could yell, lock her up.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  We know who's on MSNBC's website at midnight every night.  That's  not a political speech.  That was more like group therapy.</p><p> And honestly, the easy thing would be to make fun of Hillary Clinton.   \"Ooh, she's so wrong.\"</p><p> But it's past that.  This is sad.  Will anyone help her?  She is crying out  for?  Where are her friends?  Her husband?  The DNC?  It's like watching  someone you know fall apart.  It's poignant and tragic.  And someone ought  to help.</p><p> Tammy Bruce is a radio host and she joins us tonight.  Tammy, I'm only half  joking.  Whatever else this is, this is not empowering for women.  As the  father of three daughters, I can say that conclusively.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE PRESIDENT:  Right.  And, look, I  mean, there is a point where you never think you'd say this, but you do  begin to feel sorry for her.</p><p> And as a political person, look, a part of what her complaint was at that  event was that Fox News is trying to \"impeach her.\" In other words that  there's coverage of her on this network.  </p><p> There's actually - interestingly, of course, the complaints have come from  other Democrats across the networks, people who actually work for her  campaign.</p><p> But she is in a unique opportunity here - in a unique position where since  she is getting coverage and she clearly is searching for relevance, she  could talk about policy.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> BRUCE:  She could use this so that we would actually be discussing an  argument that she could be having about -</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, that's such a smart point.</p><p> BRUCE:  And also, frankly, maybe then she would be on the Tucker Carlson  show and you could have this conversation.</p><p> CARLSON:  Because actually she knows a lot.  She's not stupid.  And she's  been around a long time and she - her claim to fame always was I've read  the policies, only I've - and there's some truth in that actually and she  could be doing that, but she's not.</p><p> BRUCE:  She's been in the White House.  She's obviously been in the Senate.   She's been the Secretary of State.  And yet, this has devolved into this  group therapy dynamic where she's going over the same complaints that  people there in that group, maybe they've read her book, they know what her  complaints are, but she's also then inserting news of the day, like now  suddenly it's the Cambridge Analytica and it's the NRA because that's the  news that's happening now.</p><p> At this point, it's almost as though she's on an episode of intervention  where people really should try to get her into the van to get her to the  plane, to get her to the place where she can find some peace because it  does get to a point where that's a real - it's almost an abdication of a  responsibility she could have to all of her fans and supporters to really  deal seriously with the issues because they too want solutions.</p><p> And she's still, with this great attention internationally, is not using  the platform she has to present those solutions.  And it's sad and I think  that there could be - even though I would disagree with her solutions, we  at least then could move forward on these issues and try to make a  difference.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, that's exactly right.  We could add to the sum total of the  conversation, which I think is important, even if you disagree.  And we try  to do it every night.</p><p> By the way, that's her speaking live.  We actually don't have a huge desire  to cover everything Hillary Clinton despite her claim, but I think it's  interesting - and can I speak one other point?</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p> CARLSON:  The irony which people are not kind of perceiving is that her  party has moved very far from where she was.  We all long for a time when  Hillary Clinton was the most radical person in the Democratic Party.  And  she's way too moderate for Democrats by and large right now.</p><p> BRUCE:  And that actually is an interesting position she could be in.  In  arguing the things that she and her husband used to represent, which was  balanced budgets and getting people off of welfare and into work and all of  that, I mean, if she wanted to be serious, that's what she could be doing.</p><p> Arguments about how to improve the quality of women's lives.  You could  argue that - she says nobody else has been attacked like her and nobody  else was told to go away like she's been told to go away.</p><p> But Al Gore and John McCain and John Kerry actually continue to talk about  policy.  We can disagree with what they stood for, but as a woman, I think  that there are so many other opportunities with the platform she has.  And  her own party is saying, enough is enough at this point.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  If one of my kids acted like that, I'd be very upset.</p><p> Really quickly, so Christian privilege, this is a new category.  A seminar  at George Washington University here in Washington will examine how  Christians get \"unmerited perks\" and have built-in advantages over  everybody else in America.  </p><p> If you actually look at the numbers, Christians are not - anyway, are  actually not thriving in this country.  This is all measured.  But what do  you make of this?  To say this out loud, it seems like a change.</p><p> BRUCE:  Well, I don't identify as a Christian.  I believe in God.  I  believe that Jesus is the guy.  I think it's a very serious thing to  identify as a Christian.  And so, I'm taking it seriously and slowly.  </p><p> But as looking from the outside, what I see as a political commentator and  analyst is Christians maybe have a privilege of being persecuted and  attacked and martyred around the world.  I mean, it is a remarkable attack  dynamic.  Even here at home.</p><p> CARLSON:  I know.</p><p> BRUCE:  Facebook tried to apologize for refusing a Catholic university's ad  that features Jesus on the cross because it was too violent.</p><p> Remember the Chick-fil-A controversy, the so-called controversy, because of  its owner being a Christian man.</p><p> Even the attacks that Billy Graham at his death went under because of his  Christian faith.  So, there's no privilege except I think to be mocked.  </p><p> CARLSON:  There isn't.  Tammy Bruce, great to see you.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Up next, reflecting our commitment to hard news, zombie racoons.   Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Youngstown, Ohio was living in a state of fear tonight.  That  city has survived de-industrialization, crime, opioids.  Now it faces an  even more profound threat, zombie raccoons.  </p><p> In the past week, Youngstown police have responded to more than a dozen  calls of bizarre behavior during the day by these ordinarily nocturnal  critters.  </p><p> No one has captured this on camera yet.  So, imagine the raccoon in this  file video as a zombie.  </p><p> According to one eyewitness, a raccoon has walked up to him as he walked  his dog, reared up on its hind legs and then poised to attack, abruptly  fell back as though having a seizure.  </p><p> According to authorities, this isn't a virus.  It's something called  distemper.  It makes raccoons lose their fear of human beings.</p><p> Our stage director, Louis, just said this happened to him in Toledo.  So,  it's possible it's an Ohio thing.  Either way, stay safe tonight.</p><p> That's about it for us tonight.  Tune in every night at 8 p.m.  to the show  that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and especially  groupthink.  We will see you tomorrow.  </p><p> But, first, live from New York City, ladies and gentlemen, Mr.  Sean  Hannity.</p><p> END </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Apparently, Aghdam believed that YouTube's content policies have somehow sabotaged her efforts to become a digital video star. Enraged, she drove to the company's headquarters and opened fire. That's what we know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, let's pause for a moment and pretend this is not the 8 p.m. show on Fox News. Let's pretend it's somewhere else on the dial. Maybe \"CNN\" or \"MSNBC\" or actually any other cable channel or newspaper in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If that were true, by definition, we'd have to draw hard-and-fast conclusions from this tragedy using the limited facts that are available. We don't really know much at this stage, but sweeping dumb generalizations are what the media do. We would do that. And, of course, we'd need a very specific script in order to make those generalizations.</p><p>So, what do we conclude from what happened yesterday? Well, first off, the shooter was a woman. She was female. So, clearly, America has a problem with toxic feminity. And we need to address that crisis right away, starting with more university panel shaming an entire gender. Somebody alert the HR department to this.</p><p>And then, there is the gun. We focus relentlessly on the gun because nothing is more pivotal in a shooting than the weapon that was used. It's always the gun's fault. Always.</p><p>The shooter in this case used a Smith &amp; Wesson 9 mm handgun. Those guns need to be banned tomorrow, along with all other assault pistols. Now, if you disagree with that, you're evil.</p><p>Next, the shooter was a vegan and a supporter of PETA. Therefore, PETA is now a terrorist organization. Anyone who supports PETA, even though supporters who disapprove of mass shootings, is a monster and has blood on his hands.</p><p>Let's hope that \"CNN\" hosts a town hall meeting where YouTube employees can scream at PETA spokesman. They deserved to be screaned at. They caused the shooting.</p><p>But, wait, media outlets aren't reaching any of those conclusions. Why not? Well, because there's no obvious way to use this shooting to advance the objectives of the Democratic Party. So, the media will stop talking about it soon. That's how corrupt they are.</p><p>They're also incredibly stupid, especially on the subject of firearms. The people yelling at you about guns on television aren't sure what end the bullet comes out. They're kids. They're children with all the ignorance and moral certainty of fifth graders.</p><p>We can show you a million examples of that because they are everywhere, but here's the most amusing one we've seen recently. It happened yesterday.</p><p>This is MSNBC's resident genius Nicolle Wallace mistaking the opening of a soda can for gunfire. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, \"MSNBC\" HOST, \"DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE\": Steve Smith, I always go back to the horror of 9/11 and the complete reliance - we're in our tribes. We're in our corners most of our lives. I think we just heard some gunshots. Should we listen to that for a second, control room? That's not a gun shot.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Not gunshots? No, Nicolle, not gunshots. Pretty funny. But be certain to listen very carefully if she lectures about the Second Amendment because she knows a lot about it.</p><p>Pete Hegseth is \"Fox &amp; friends\" weekend host. He is a former member of the US military, a decorated one, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, Pete, it's a pretty simple question. We kind of know the script. We know the way these things unfold, how they're analyzed in the press. We draw sweeping conclusions from a pretty limited set of facts. You're not hearing that tonight. You're not hearing other channels say toxic femininity as a threat to America. Why is that?</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" WEEKEND HOST: Well, of course, you're not wrong bad guy, Tucker. Wrong bad guy.</p><p>Female of Iranian descent. She's a fitness buff. She's a vegan. She's a PETA member. Not an NRA member. Not a Trump supporter. Not a member of the NRA. And as a result, doesn't fit the very convenient narrative. And as a result, it's silenced, Tucker.</p><p>I mean, it is \"NBC\", \"CBS\" negligent coverage. \"ABC\" glancing blow. \"NBC\" said she's apparently an animal rights activist. They are moving away from this as quickly as they can with almost - imagine if it was an NRA member that did this. Is he apparently an NRA member or is he actually an NRA member?</p><p>In this case, apparently an animal rights activists, but no judgment or blood on the hands of a PETA member. Always blood on the hands of an NRA member because it would be absurd to me to define an entire population as violent because they believe in animal rights, just like it's absurd to believe an entire population of Second Amendment supporters that believes in violence because they support our rights.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I'm a little confused here. So, what you're suggesting - and my producer just said in my ear. He's watching the other channels. None of them are covering this right now - that the coverage of gun crimes really isn't an effort to reduce the number of gun crimes. It's an effort to make a series of partisan points. Is that what you're saying?</p><p>HEGSETH: It's an effort to impugn the Second Amendment and those who support it, Tucker. Ultimately, it all depends on the labels that apply. You know this. Identity politics are one-sided.</p><p>If you're a white Christian male who voted for Donald Trump and believe in the Second Amendment who owns an AR-15, then you must be - have a proclivity to violence.</p><p>But you are a female of any other shade who owns a handgun and supports animals and you commit violence, nothing to see here, turn this channel. \"Good morning America\", as they did this morning, will not even cover this deal, this shooting and won't draw a larger narrative as a result.</p><p>Again, apparently an animal rights activist. This is what the modern media has turned into, cheerleading for a cause, which is taking away our guns, which is exactly what we know they want to do as opposed to reporting the news and then moving on if it's not relevant.</p><p>CARLSON: It doesn't sound like journalism. It does seem to me that it crosses a line when it moves from attacking the president personally - they don't like Trump. I get it. He doesn't like them, by the way.</p><p>HEGSETH: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: But from that - which you could sort of understand it. You know you probably shouldn't do it, but I get it - to moving over to advocating for specific policies that affect 320 million Americans as if there's only one side of the debate.</p><p>It moves from childish annoyance to full-on propaganda.</p><p>HEGSETH: Of course. I've heard journalists on other networks say it is our obligation to continue to talk about the Parkland shooting because we owe it to the American people to keep the conversation alive.</p><p>If we don't talk about it, the conversation doesn't continue and policies don't change in Washington DC. If that doesn't sound like activism, I don't know what is.</p><p>I mean, it's your job to report the news that is relevant and the shooting - a mass shooting is, of course, relevant. You cover it and then you move on as necessary. They're deciding what to coverage and dwell on to try to change -</p><p>CARLSON: That's right. But what's so striking is, if you're going to pick a topic that the media would lobby on, maybe camera angles or lighting, they sort of makeup - I mean, they're experts on that stuff. But is there any group in America that knows less about firearms? Nicolle Wallace mistook a soda opening for a gunshot.</p><p>HEGSETH: I opened my Diet Mountain Dew, which I happen to like, and no one around here jumped and thought it was an AR-15, let alone a 9 mm. I mean, I need Diet Mountain Dew because I'm up at six in the morning like you used to be. It keeps us awake. But I've never mistaken nor would anyone I know would mistake that as gun fire.</p><p>They they know nothing, Tucker. How many members of this media are members of the NRA? How many of them have ever fired an AR-15, let alone an M4, which I carry, let alone a 249 squad automatic weapon.</p><p>They don't know a squad automatic weapon from a BB gun, yet they're going to tell me what I what I can or cannot carry. Of course, it's political activism to help their Democratic buddies.</p><p>There is a tank. It's not convenient. They're not going to cover it.</p><p>CARLSON: Who put all the dumb people on TV? I always ask myself that. Pete, it's great to see you. You're not one of them. And I appreciate your coming on.</p><p>HEGSETH: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well, several tech CEOs responded to the YouTube shooting by demanding that regular people be deprived off their right to carry firearms.</p><p>That would include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who tweeted this, \"We can't keep being reactive to this and thinking and praying it won't happen again in our schools, jobs, our community spots. It is beyond time to evolve our policies.\" He didn't specify which ones, but you know what he was talking about. He cares much more than you do.</p><p>Dorsey then endorsed demands issued by the March for our Lives. Those would include, again not specific, banning high-capacity magazines, confiscating all weapons designated as assault weapons.</p><p>Now, what's interesting about all this is that, in 2015, Twitter, the company he runs, spent more than $68,000 providing, yes, personal security to Jack Dorsey.</p><p>Were those guards unarmed? Right. No, they weren't.</p><p>Joel Payne is former director of African-American advertising for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaigns and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Great to see you, Joel. I appreciate your coming on. So, it's hard to read this as anything else but an effort by the people in charge to bring more power to themselves, which is what people in charge do kind of instinctively. We get the guns. you don't. Shut up and obey. Why is that not what's happening right now.</p><p>JOEL PAYNE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Tucker, I don't think really think that's the right way to look at this issue. And I really enjoyed listening to your conversation with your colleague a little bit earlier.</p><p>I am interested to here that you guy think that it's funny that someone on TV in this environment thought that a soda can opening was a gunshot. You thought that was funny.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's idiotic. Just to clarify, I want to say that I think it's idiotic. But that studio didn't have gunshots. It had a soda opening.</p><p>And my point is that, if you're going to advocate for positions, you have a moral obligation to learn something about the topic. And most people who are doing that haven't bothered to learn. And that's the problem.</p><p>I'm not in any way denigrating the fear people feel in the face of gunfire. I'm making fun of people mistaking a Mountain Dew can for gunfire.</p><p>Look, the point is ordinary people are afraid. You're absolutely right. We agree on that. So, why would the people in charge who are protected by armed security demand that no one else be allowed to protect themselves, if you see what I mean?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, I have some frustration towards what I heard from the Twitter CEO today, but for a different reason. I don't like this trend that we have of waiting for gun violence to come to your backyard before you get worke about it. I mean, just because it happened at a tech company yesterday, as you got this letter with all these tech CEOs who decided to sign on.</p><p>Listen, I was touched recently by gun violence. I had a very close friend that was impacted by what happened at the veteran home in California. But, guess what, I felt strongly about gun violence and about all of the concerns around that before that. It didn't take that issue to pique my interest.</p><p>By the way, it's interesting, Tucker. A lot of the people who watch this show and a lot of people who watch this network feel the same way I do.</p><p>If you look at the polls -</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I feel the same way you do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, but hold on. Let's be honest. One of the sort of pieces of political rhetoric that drives me the craziest is the idea that only a select few care about gun violence.</p><p>I think most people, most normal people are horrified by shootings. I know I am. So, the question is not do you feel deeply about or are you upset. Of course, you're upset. The question is what's the most effective response? What's the wise thing to do? That's where the debate is. It's not over who cares and who doesn't. Everybody cares. I mean, come on now.</p><p>PAYNE: So, yes, I would turn that question back to you and say, what should we do?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'll give you a perfect example. So, with the Parkland shooting, we have a well-documented string of failures by people whose job it was to protect the kids in that school. And they didn't.</p><p>There were four armed cops outside - four! - who heard the gunfire and didn't go in. I never heard their names mentioned at the March for our Lives. I doubt you know their names. I never heard anybody mention that.</p><p>We hire people to protect those kids. Seventeen were murdered because they didn't act, but it's the NRA's fault? That's insane. That's just pure politics. You're not taking it seriously if you reach that conclusion, I would say.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. There were a lot of people who failed those children that day. Some of them were the people who didn't run into those building, but a number were people who were in the State House in Tallahassee and who were on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.</p><p>They had the chance to act. You could have acted after Sandy Hook. You could have acted after Orlando (ph). You had so many opportunities to act.</p><p>CARLSON: You're defending the people in power, as almost everyone in the left does, the people in power are blameless. They didn't do anything wrong.</p><p>It's you out there who've committed no crime whatsoever. The guns in my closet, if I had them, would be no threat to anybody, but I have to disarm, but the cops whose job it was to protect the kids, they're cool. We can't blame them.</p><p>PAYNE: I didn't say that. I actually agreed with you. I said they share some blame. I said that the blame didn't end with them, though. It also extended to the people who were in Tallahassee at their State Houses and in Capitol Hill and State Houses all across the country who failed to act.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, I take you seriously. It's why I wanted to talk to you tonight. So, just in the minute and a half we have left, just give me a discreet step, specific step that they could have taken to prevent the Parkland shooting, for example.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, let's look at a couple of things. Why hasn't the president acted on bump stocks. I thought he was hot to trot on that.</p><p>CARLSON: What does that have to do with Parkland? Bump stock makes your rifle less accurate. See, this is like - you don't know anything about guns.</p><p>PAYNE: Here's the problem, though, Tucker. Your answer here is, well, it wouldn't stop this specific act.</p><p>CARLSON: I am asking an honest question, which is what's -</p><p>PAYNE: We have a gun violence culture.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you're blaming the State House in Tallahassee for our culture?</p><p>PAYNE: Actually, I am. We have a laissez faire culture to gun violence.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. When I asked you an adult question -</p><p>PAYNE: We have a culture that has accepted that gun violence is something we can't do anything about when we know we can.</p><p>CARLSON: I feel it is something we can do something about. And when armed guards neglect their duty to protect children, I think we should hold them accountable.</p><p>You instead shifted the blame from the people who actually had power to people whose other positions you don't like in the State House, Republicans.</p><p>I asked then - trying to be rational - what should they have done? And you said Trump should ban bump stocks, which had no role in the Parkland shooting.</p><p>PAYNE: I didn't finish. I was going to say a little bit more. The president can act on this. by the way, the NRA, they could be partners here, right?</p><p>The NRA are running scared. The reason why you see them turning John Paul Stevens and a bunch of 17 year olds into boogeymen is because they know public sentiment is at an all-time low for what they fight for, which is the right for gun manufacturers to make money.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're arguing rhetoric and bumper stickers. I want actual solutions because, like you, I care. I want to know what the new law is that would have prevented Parkland.</p><p>There are a lot of shootings. Lot of different causes. I asked for one specific answer to that one and I got bump stocks and John Paul Stevens.</p><p>PAYNE: I can give you more.</p><p>CARLSON: How about one.</p><p>PAYNE: We can restrict access to people who are mentally ill.</p><p>CARLSON: We already have done that.</p><p>PAYNE: We can stop terrorists from purchasing guns. We could have done that. Congress wouldn't do that. You've got Toomey's legislation. You've got Manchin's legislation.</p><p>CARLSON: We already have the laws.</p><p>PAYNE: You've got Durbin's legislation. So many people have tried to act on this, but the intransigence in Washington led by the NRA won't allow it.</p><p>CARLSON: That's a lie. If you go buy a gun, it screams people who are mentally ill. The authorities, the actual authorities failed to screen this kid despite the fact everyone knew he was mentally ill. They didn't anything.</p><p>PAYNE: Unfortunately, the majority of Americans and the majority of Republicans actually disagree with you and the polling reflects that.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. I don't know what to say. Those are the facts. Joe, thank you. Thank you for coming on.</p><p>PAYNE: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate it.</p><p>Well, at the top of the show, one of our guests mentioned that \"GMA\" did not cover the YouTube shooting. In fact, that show did spend time on the shooting this morning over the course of a couple of hours. We wanted to correct that.</p><p>Washington elites are horrified that the president may want to send troops to guard our border, but they're also horrified that those troops may have to leave Syria. It tells you everything about their priorities and we're going to unpack for you next.</p><p>CARLSON: Every once in a while, one of those stories comes along where the red light goes off and you suddenly understand what's going on just beneath the surface. It all makes sense.</p><p>That happened today. So, the administration recently suggested it wants to pull American troops out of Syria now that ISIS has been crushed and the official mission has been achieved.</p><p>How did Washington react to this, the idea that our troops might come home? Totally outraged.</p><p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican of South Carolina, called that \"the single worst decision the president could make.\"</p><p>Others imputed darker motives. A writer called Amy Siskind tweeted this, \"After our military discussed sending in more troops, Trump suddenly and unilaterally decides to pull our troops out. Who does this help (hint: Putin)!\"</p><p>Unilaterally? Hilarious. He's the president.</p><p>Well, \"CNN\" and \"The Washington Post\", of course, made the same claim. If you don't support yet another foreign war with no clear objective or end date, you're in league with our enemies. You're unpatriotic.</p><p>They tell us American troops absolutely have to be fighting in Syria. OK. You've heard that for years. But at the same time, they tell us that American troops absolutely should not be protecting America's own borders.</p><p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order deploying the National Guard to the Mexican border, part of an effort to halt illegal immigration.</p><p>The people in charge, all of them, hate this idea. It's illegal, they say. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus issued a statement today saying, that's wasteful. Of course, that's not their real concern. Obviously.</p><p>According to one \"NBC\" analyst, it \"carries the noxious whiff of military rule.\"</p><p>So, at the very least, these two stories juxtaposed to each other, butted back-to-back are clarifying. In the eyes of the geniuses in charge, our military does not exist for national defense. You thought otherwise? They don't think that.</p><p>Our military, they believe, exists only for the defense of other countries. In recent years, we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Libya. Other countries protect their borders. That's great, said the panel on the \"Morning Joe\".</p><p>But defending our own borders is a crime against humanity. Your son is welcome to die in Syria, as one American soldier already has. That's patriotic. But defending America? Totally and completely immoral. Who put these people in charge exactly? You know exactly what they think of the country. Not much.</p><p>David Tafuri is a former State Department official. He joins us now. Now, David, these two stories really tell you everything. You have people - bipartisan, it's not just Democrats at all - saying we have a moral obligation to keep the borders of Syria intact.</p><p>We don't want unauthorized people coming into Syria - the Kurds, the Persians - we've got to keep them out. But to use our military to protect our borders, that's the whiff of military rule. It's immoral. How does that work?</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, that's not why we have US soldiers in Syria. It's not to protect the borders. It's primarily to fight terrorism. In fact, to fight ISIS.</p><p>I was just in Iraq three weeks ago again. When I saw there, what I saw is that ISIS is almost defeated. It's lost its territory in Iraq. It's lost its territory in Syria. But remember it was created out of Syria. So, it's a precarious situation.</p><p>Moreover, the fundamental reasons why ISIS came into being are not gone yet. There are still divisions in Iraq, divisions in Syria, problems with the government that created ISIS. And, therefore, we need to be there to finish the job with ISIS.</p><p>CARLSON: But, actually, did the US government and or our 2,000 troops or the Assad government do more to fight ISIS? Oh, wait. Let me answer that question. I know that Nikki Haley is telling us it's a living hell and Assad is Satan. But, actually, bad guy; did a lot to fight ISIS. I mean, let's be honest about that.</p><p>TAFURI: He's done little to fight ISIS.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, OK.</p><p>TAFURI: In fact, many think that's he's also party responsible for letting ISIS be there because it's a convenient foe to have.</p><p>CARLSON: Who are the who think that?</p><p>TAFURI: But let's go back to Trump's policy on Syria because it started quite well. In February, 2017, he does air strikes on Assad because Assad used chemical weapons.</p><p>It looked like he was going to actually diverge -</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think that's true. That's never been proved.</p><p>TAFURI: That's absolutely been proven.</p><p>CARLSON: No. It actually has not been proven. We had no one on the ground to verify that as of the moment that we sent airstrikes into Syria in retaliation. We didn't. No American verified that. I don't know that we know that's true.</p><p>It's like one of these things that all smart people - oh, it's true. Are you unpatriotic? Are you for Putin? No, I don't believe that's true actually.</p><p>TAFURI: Tucker, all of the reporting from the ground -</p><p>CARLSON: There was no reporting from the ground.</p><p>TAFURI: And including doctors who examined the victims of Assad, said it's true.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, American doctors.</p><p>TAFURI: President Trump and the Republican administration believed it was true. That's why they did airstrikes.</p><p>CARLSON: I couldn't agree more. And I was skeptical when that happened because my job is not to ratify every decision Trump makes, but to explain what, I think, is right for our country.</p><p>So, why is it we sent 2,000 troops into Syria in the middle of a conflict we don't even understand, but it's immoral to send them to keep the invasion on our southern border from continuing into our country, how does that work?</p><p>TAFURI: Let's talk about Syria first and then we'll about -</p><p>CARLSON: We're almost out of time.</p><p>TAFURI: So, the troops are in Syria for very important reasons. Remember, these are special forces troops. So, they're not doing all of the fighting. They're some of our best fighters, but they're also training the indigenous forces in Syria and they made a lot of progress working with the Syrian Kurds.</p><p>And the Syrian Kurds are our friends. And the Syrian Kurds have put their lives on the line to fight ISIS with us. And if we pull out suddenly, we're leaving them to be -</p><p>CARLSON: How about the South Californians who were born in this, including me. I'm a native South Californian. No one is looking out for my interest because I'm not a Syrian Kurd.</p><p>TAFURI: You're right. We have every right to protect our border and President Trump put forward a border proposal with a budget to Congress in order to do that. He failed to push that through. It was a failure in leadership.</p><p>CARLSON: So, where is it immoral to protect our country with our military?</p><p>TAFURI: It's not immoral. It is moral to protect our country. If we have to, if there's a crisis situation, we should protect our country with our military.</p><p>CARLSON: We've got 11 million people living here illegally. That's not a crisis?</p><p>TAFURI: The appropriate force to protect the border is the Border Patrol, which comes under the Department of Homeland Security. And President Trump put forward a proposal to fund them and he should be able to push that through Congress.</p><p>CARLSON: The left wants to abolish ICE.</p><p>TAFURI: He should not treat a situation that's not a crisis as a crisis.</p><p>CARLSON: Not a crisis. But Syrian Kurds - I want my son to go fight on behalf of the Syrian Kurds.</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS which is responsible for deaths in America and across Europe, that's who we're fighting.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. I appreciate it. David, thank you.</p><p>TAFURI: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: On the left, you may have noticed everything is about race. Everything! Even things that have nothing to do with race. Most things are about economics, by the way. It doesn't matter. One channel is calling president a racist for mocking Barack Obama. Part of a long theme. We'll get to it in a minute.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a lot of people hate the president. So, of course, everything he does must be motivated by racial animus because racism is bad. So, of course, Trump would be a bad racist.</p><p>Yesterday, on CNN, former White House Communications Director Jen Psaki said that President Trump's Cheatin' Obama nickname was not just weird, it was racist.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEN PSAKI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Given Trump's history, you can also guess there might be racial undertones there. He was the founder of the birther movement. Perhaps I'm going to a very evil place with that, but I think history tells us that's a possibility.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know evil. Just like weird and confusing. OK, maybe it's racist. How? Never explained.</p><p>Meanwhile, over at CNN, commentator Tara Setmayer said it's OK to call black Republicans racial slurs. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HARRIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNHYPHENATED AMERICA: It takes somebody with very thick skin to go out there and be black and say 'I'm a Republican, I'm a conservative,' because what's going to happen is they're going to come on your network and they're going to be called everything (INAUDIBLE), they're going to called an Uncle Tom (EXPLETIVE DELETED) and everything like that.</p><p>TARA SETMAYER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: What are you talking about?</p><p>And so, first things first -</p><p>HARRIS: Are you going to sit there and act like that's not true?</p><p>SETMAYER: Well, if you act like it and someone calls you out on it, then we can't do anything about that. Maybe the messengers need to be better.</p><p>HARRIS: So it's OK to actually call someone a particular name as long as you feel like they're acting like that? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>SETMAYER: I didn't say that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Poor Don Lemon. Nice guy. The show is really unbelievable.</p><p>Christopher Harris was on it the other night. He's the man you saw sitting there. He is the executive director of Unhyphenated America and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, I watched that clip. And, first, I thought - I felt so bad for you. But I also thought it was kind of an amazing moment where you basically had someone defending the use of racial slurs because they're political expedient.</p><p>HARRIS: Well, what happened, Tucker, the left showed who they really are. Of course, Tara calls herself a conservative and a Republican, but, yes - well, we'll let her say what she wants to say.</p><p>But at the end of the day, what the left does, they try to put everybody in a box.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HARRIS: And we with Unhyphenated America, what we believe is America is best when it's unhyphenated. That if you believe in, if you embrace, if you understand that - and embrace the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, then you're an American and there's no need for any prefix or suffix. You're just an American.</p><p>And so, trying to put everybody into a particular box, saying that you must think a particular way because of your paint job, as one of my buddies says, the melanin content in your skin, is one of the problems that the left has.</p><p>And what they're doing is they're focusing on identity politics. And they try to say, well, Donald Trump, obviously, must be a racist because, well, look at the lack of diversity without kind of doing some critical analysis and saying, well, how many black people actually applied for a White House internship.</p><p>And even then, when you look at what exactly what happened with Ms. Setmayer is that she just vilified any black person who doesn't toe the lines.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. So, what happens - I mean, one of the reasons for the hysteria, I think, is Trump actually got a higher percentage of the black vote than the Republican who ran before him - Mitt Romney. Not a ton, but more. So, that freaked them out.</p><p>But what happens to the country long term if you encourage everyone in it, of all colors, to think of themselves first as members of a racial or ethnic group. What happens over time?</p><p>HARRIS: Well, balkanization. The term a lot of people are not familiar with it. But the Balkan region, what you have is a lot of different tribes, different groups of people who are all constantly warring against each other.</p><p>And one of the things - we are the United States of America. I mean, you're maybe a Virginian, or you're a South Carolinian or a Texan, whatever like that, and so you might have a certain amount of pride for being from the state that you're from, but at the end of the day we're all Americans. We have something unifying our culture.</p><p>Once again, it's those beliefs in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and it's one of those things that they keep trying to push these identity politics to say that you must think a particular way because the color of your skin.</p><p>But, more importantly, they want you believe - they want me to believe that because of the color of my skin that I am inherently a victim, that I will always be a victim and that I should vote a particular way for the people who, I guess, they want to protect me.</p><p>But we can look at the black community and here's the reality. What hasn't gotten better in the past 50 years, as long as blacks have been voting, 70- plus percent for the Democratic Party.</p><p>No one can say that things have gotten better from economic standpoint. The schools haven't gotten better. Economically, we're not doing better. Family-wise, we're not doing better.</p><p>But yet, these are the points that they keep wanting to push with these identity politics issues and it's just really maddening.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think - quickly - that maybe the identity politics is designed to distract people from thinking about their actual circumstances, from asking the questions you just raised, which is like, is my life better, am I making more, is my family better off.</p><p>If they can wave the red flag of race in front of you, maybe you won't think about those things.</p><p>HARRIS: The reality is - I attended McLean Bible Church, which is a huge church. It's an ethnically diverse church. I mean, I always say that the culture is Christian, but is an ethnically diverse church. We have over 100 different cultures - excuse me, ethnicities represented in our church.</p><p>And when you have people interacting one-on-one, there's no real issues of racism.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. And church is the best possible example. Thank you very much. That was great.</p><p>HARRIS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Google is expanding research efforts in China that could eventually help the Chinese military overcome the American military. And that's terrifyingly the more you learn about it. The most recent installment of our \"Tech Tyranny\" series is coming up next.</p><p>CARLSON: All this week, we're airing special reports on \"Tech Tyranny\" looking at how big tech companies are getting more and more power and endangering a lot of things that we think are important, like democracy and clear thinking.</p><p>Here's another example. China's military is obsessed with artificial intelligence and is investing massive resources into developing an advantage over our military in artificial intelligence.</p><p>Eric Schmidt chairs Alphabet. That's the parent company of Google. He's admitted that China will soon be the world's leader in AI and they'll use it for military purposes.</p><p>He's right. Maybe.</p><p>Now, Google is dramatically expanding its artificial intelligence research operations in China, which is bolstering an effort that could eventually imperil security of this country.</p><p>Paul Scharre is the author of \"Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War\", which looks like a horrifying book. I haven't read it yet, but I plan to. Paul joins us tonight.</p><p>Thanks, Paul, for coming on.</p><p>PAUL SCHARRE, \"ARMY OF NONE: AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS AND THE FUTURE OF WAR\" AUTHOR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, give us the overview of this. Did I characterize it fairly, do you think?</p><p>SCHARRE: Look, it's not surprising that Google is looking to make research investments in China. China has got top-tier AI talent. Human capital is key here. And they've got access to a lot of data.</p><p>China will have 20 percent of the world's data by 2020. And data is the fuel that powers machine learning.</p><p>And so, with a company like Google, they want access to all that data. So, they've said, yes, (INAUDIBLE) setting up more research in China. And that is concerning for the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I guess, what I am confused by, so Google describes itself as a multinational company. Really, a kind of corporation of the world.</p><p>But it was incubated here. And everything about Google fundamentally is American. It wouldn't have been possible to start Google in China. And yet, Google doesn't seem to feel any obligation whatsoever to the US government or to the American people. So, how does that work exactly?</p><p>SCHARRE: Look, this is capitalism.</p><p>CARLSON: It's disgusting, actually.</p><p>SCHARRE: These companies are responsible to shareholders. They're not accountable to the American people, and so they're going to do what's in their business interests.</p><p>And if there is a business interest, they move overseas. They set up research center to offshore jobs. They're going to do that.</p><p>CARLSON: So, American taxpayers subsidize the education of the people who founded Google and who work there and we create the regulatory and legal framework possible for it to start.</p><p>Again, no other company like this has started in Europe, for example. Certainly not in Asia. So, we make it possible. And then, they turn around and undermine the national security of the country.</p><p>I know that people describe as market capitalism, but that seems immoral to me.</p><p>SCHARRE: Look, at the end of the day, we are in a technology race. And it's not just China. It's other countries as well.</p><p>Vladimir Putin has said whoever controls AI will lead the world.</p><p>France! France just released a new plan on artificial intelligence. We're going to have to compete. We're going to have to make US an attractive place for people to come and invest and do AI research and found companies and grow them. And we're going to have to win this race by being faster than others.</p><p>CARLSON: Here's another thing that confuses me. And since you've covered it, maybe you've got the answer. So, companies like Google are big on importing talent. You and I understand why. And they argue that we just don't have enough engineers, for example. So, we need to bring them in on H1B visas.</p><p>Is there any thought by the billionaires who run these companies, hey, maybe we should take some of our billions and invest in American education. This country isn't producing an adequate number of scientists. Maybe we can help with that. Or because they feel no obligation to the country, only to their shareholders. They don't feel that?</p><p>SCHARRE: I think some of these leaders do. You see Eric Schmidt, the former chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent company was part of the Defense Department's Innovation Advisory Board.</p><p>He has been very active in talking to people at the Pentagon about how the United States can retain its leadership in artificial intelligence.</p><p>So, some of these leaders care.</p><p>CARLSON: Really? Because Andrew Carnegie put a library in every town in America once he got rich here. I don't see any of these guys giving back really in any way to the country. They seem just to be taking from it. Only left wing.</p><p>SCHARRE: I think a lot of them could do more, right? And more philanthropy from billionaires would be great. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. It would be great. And we should demand it because this country made their fortunes possible. I think. Paul, thank you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p><p>Hillary Clinton says the NRA, Russia, sexism, a ton of other things, all are to blame for her defeat in 2016. A lot of you are going to think why is she still talking like this? Is she OK? A sincere question. Next.</p><p>CARLSON: It's been nearly 18 months - we've been keeping track - and Hillary Clinton's blame train is not even close to running out of fuel. It's getting concerning.</p><p>Well, speaking on Tuesday night at the Wing, which is a women-only club in New York - because it's women-only, it's not sexist - Clinton began blaming everybody to the NRA to misogyny itself for her defeat in the 2016 election. Here's part of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, LOST TO DONALD TRUMP IN 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: Before the Comey letter, I was ahead. I got more votes than anybody in history except one term of President Obama.</p><p>Every day that goes by, more evidence, more proof about fake news and the Russians and Cambridge Analytica, misogyny and sexism.</p><p>I've taken on the NRA for years. And they've spent more money against me than they've ever spent against anybody. And now, we know the Russians paid for some of it. Paid for actors who are Russian agents, personnel to dress up in those very attractive jail outfits and go around in a mock jail where people could yell, lock her up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We know who's on MSNBC's website at midnight every night. That's not a political speech. That was more like group therapy.</p><p>And honestly, the easy thing would be to make fun of Hillary Clinton. \"Ooh, she's so wrong.\"</p><p>But it's past that. This is sad. Will anyone help her? She is crying out for? Where are her friends? Her husband? The DNC? It's like watching someone you know fall apart. It's poignant and tragic. And someone ought to help.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is a radio host and she joins us tonight. Tammy, I'm only half joking. Whatever else this is, this is not empowering for women. As the father of three daughters, I can say that conclusively.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE PRESIDENT: Right. And, look, I mean, there is a point where you never think you'd say this, but you do begin to feel sorry for her.</p><p>And as a political person, look, a part of what her complaint was at that event was that Fox News is trying to \"impeach her.\" In other words that there's coverage of her on this network.</p><p>There's actually - interestingly, of course, the complaints have come from other Democrats across the networks, people who actually work for her campaign.</p><p>But she is in a unique opportunity here - in a unique position where since she is getting coverage and she clearly is searching for relevance, she could talk about policy.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BRUCE: She could use this so that we would actually be discussing an argument that she could be having about -</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's such a smart point.</p><p>BRUCE: And also, frankly, maybe then she would be on the Tucker Carlson show and you could have this conversation.</p><p>CARLSON: Because actually she knows a lot. She's not stupid. And she's been around a long time and she - her claim to fame always was I've read the policies, only I've - and there's some truth in that actually and she could be doing that, but she's not.</p><p>BRUCE: She's been in the White House. She's obviously been in the Senate. She's been the Secretary of State. And yet, this has devolved into this group therapy dynamic where she's going over the same complaints that people there in that group, maybe they've read her book, they know what her complaints are, but she's also then inserting news of the day, like now suddenly it's the Cambridge Analytica and it's the NRA because that's the news that's happening now.</p><p>At this point, it's almost as though she's on an episode of intervention where people really should try to get her into the van to get her to the plane, to get her to the place where she can find some peace because it does get to a point where that's a real - it's almost an abdication of a responsibility she could have to all of her fans and supporters to really deal seriously with the issues because they too want solutions.</p><p>And she's still, with this great attention internationally, is not using the platform she has to present those solutions. And it's sad and I think that there could be - even though I would disagree with her solutions, we at least then could move forward on these issues and try to make a difference.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's exactly right. We could add to the sum total of the conversation, which I think is important, even if you disagree. And we try to do it every night.</p><p>By the way, that's her speaking live. We actually don't have a huge desire to cover everything Hillary Clinton despite her claim, but I think it's interesting - and can I speak one other point?</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The irony which people are not kind of perceiving is that her party has moved very far from where she was. We all long for a time when Hillary Clinton was the most radical person in the Democratic Party. And she's way too moderate for Democrats by and large right now.</p><p>BRUCE: And that actually is an interesting position she could be in. In arguing the things that she and her husband used to represent, which was balanced budgets and getting people off of welfare and into work and all of that, I mean, if she wanted to be serious, that's what she could be doing.</p><p>Arguments about how to improve the quality of women's lives. You could argue that - she says nobody else has been attacked like her and nobody else was told to go away like she's been told to go away.</p><p>But Al Gore and John McCain and John Kerry actually continue to talk about policy. We can disagree with what they stood for, but as a woman, I think that there are so many other opportunities with the platform she has. And her own party is saying, enough is enough at this point.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. If one of my kids acted like that, I'd be very upset.</p><p>Really quickly, so Christian privilege, this is a new category. A seminar at George Washington University here in Washington will examine how Christians get \"unmerited perks\" and have built-in advantages over everybody else in America.</p><p>If you actually look at the numbers, Christians are not - anyway, are actually not thriving in this country. This is all measured. But what do you make of this? To say this out loud, it seems like a change.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, I don't identify as a Christian. I believe in God. I believe that Jesus is the guy. I think it's a very serious thing to identify as a Christian. And so, I'm taking it seriously and slowly.</p><p>But as looking from the outside, what I see as a political commentator and analyst is Christians maybe have a privilege of being persecuted and attacked and martyred around the world. I mean, it is a remarkable attack dynamic. Even here at home.</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>BRUCE: Facebook tried to apologize for refusing a Catholic university's ad that features Jesus on the cross because it was too violent.</p><p>Remember the Chick-fil-A controversy, the so-called controversy, because of its owner being a Christian man.</p><p>Even the attacks that Billy Graham at his death went under because of his Christian faith. So, there's no privilege except I think to be mocked.</p><p>CARLSON: There isn't. Tammy Bruce, great to see you.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Up next, reflecting our commitment to hard news, zombie racoons. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Youngstown, Ohio was living in a state of fear tonight. That city has survived de-industrialization, crime, opioids. Now it faces an even more profound threat, zombie raccoons.</p><p>In the past week, Youngstown police have responded to more than a dozen calls of bizarre behavior during the day by these ordinarily nocturnal critters.</p><p>No one has captured this on camera yet. So, imagine the raccoon in this file video as a zombie.</p><p>According to one eyewitness, a raccoon has walked up to him as he walked his dog, reared up on its hind legs and then poised to attack, abruptly fell back as though having a seizure.</p><p>According to authorities, this isn't a virus. It's something called distemper. It makes raccoons lose their fear of human beings.</p><p>Our stage director, Louis, just said this happened to him in Toledo. So, it's possible it's an Ohio thing. Either way, stay safe tonight.</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. Tune in every night at 8 p.m. to the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and especially groupthink. We will see you tomorrow.</p><p>But, first, live from New York City, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Sean Hannity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018040401cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1N-JTF1-DXH2-64HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7648\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 4, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00079Z1</classCode><className>SMITH &amp;

The remedy - or, more precisely, what a finding of liability would entail - is central to determine whether there is a breach in the first place.This statement is true as a matter of positive law - Van den Bergh Foods[5] encapsulates the essence of the case law - and is also true from a normative standpoint - as the post on smartphones and cameras sought to explain.The messages I have received following these posts are certainly sensible. How can the remedy determine the applicable legal test? Is it not getting the case backwards?</p><p> Should we not establish an infringement first and then figure out the way to remedy it?These questions, no doubt reasonable, are based on a fundamental assumption, which is that the finding of an infringement and a remedy are two separate steps, independent of one another.I do not believe this assumption reflects the reality of the interaction between legal tests and remedies. More importantly, I do not believe the Court treats the infringement and the remedy as separate steps. They are rather two sides of the same coin.The remedy reliably tells us what a case is about, and what the legal test isA finding of infringement and a remedy are so closely intertwined that the single most reliable way to tell whether there is a competition law breach is to inquire about how to bring the alleged breach to an end. In other words: to understand what a firm has done (and whether what it has done is prohibited), the best approach is to ask the claimant what the alleged infringer would need to do to comply with the law.This point can be illustrated by reference to refusal to deal scenarios. These cases are not always easy to spot, and the lines are sometimes blurred between them and other legal categories, including tying and 'margin squeeze'.How to tell apart one category from the other? Inquire what the endgame would be. If the endgame is one in which a court or authority mandates (directly or indirectly, implicitly or explicitly) shared access to an input or an infrastructure, then the case raises the issues that are typical of refusal to deal cases. For the same reason, indispensability would be an element of the legal test.Suppose, conversely, the remedy is a different one. For instance, an obligation not to require exclusivity from the firm's customers. If so, we would be in Hoffmann-La Roche and Intel territory (where nobody has ever thought of making indispensability an element of the legal test).These statements are hardly revolutionary. It is, in essence, what the Court held in Van den Bergh Foods and then in TeliaSonera. In Van den Bergh Foods, the firm argued that indispensability was an element of the legal test. Both the General Court and the Court of Justice, in light of the endgame, concluded that the case belonged in the Hoffmann-La Roche/Intel family, and rejected the argument.The remedy is routinely considered when calibrating the legal testThe history of competition law also teaches us that the remedy (that is, what the case would involve in practice) has been routinely considered when designing the appropriate legal test.In particular, courts tend to craft strict legal tests where a finding of infringement would demand the administration of regulatory-like remedy (such as mandating access obligations and setting the terms and conditions under which access is to be granted).Again, this idea is hardly revolutionary, and is part of our law. Why is indispensability part of the legal test in refusal to deal cases? Magill and Bronner seem to reflect deep awareness of the implications of a finding of infringement. Think of Magill. Again, the question is: what is the endgame of ruling that a refusal to license copyright-protected information is abusive? Imposing a duty to license on the right holder. By definition, there is a tension between such an endgame and the logic of intellectual property systems (the very point of which the right to refuse to license).It is not a surprise, against this background, that the Court confined to 'exceptional circumstances' the instances in which Article 102 TFEU can be relied upon to impose a duty to license (thereby minimising the tension with intellectual property systems).The uncertainties and complexities of administering a remedy have als been mentioned as factors to consider when crafting a legal test. In his celebrated article[6] on essential facilities, Phillip Areeda - the ultimate centrist in our field - expressed the view that '[n]o court should impose a duty to deal that it cannot explain or adequately and reasonably supervise' and went on to warn against the imposition of regulatory-like obligations.The EU experience shows that competition authorities do not fare much better than courts when it comes to the administration of these proactive remedies. The failure of the media player remedy in Microsoft I often comes up in these discussions. The principles-based approach to the question in Google Shopping and Android, and the resulting state of limbo (which appears to continue), another one.Big Tech and legal tests: the question that will not go awayThe discussion above gives, hopefully, a sense of what is going on, from a legal standpoint, in relation to Big Tech. Many of these cases demand regulatory-like intervention, and this, more frequently and more intensely than in the past. It would seem that some competition authorities are more confident than they used to about their ability to redesign products and to tweak business models (other authorities, like the CMA, are more cautious, as the Final Report[7] on digital advertising shows).This increased confidence tends to trickle down into the interpretation of competition law provisions.

My main point in both is that the remedy is not an aftertho...</p><p>Following two of my latest posts \u2013 a though experiment on smartphones and cameras, and an update on Slovak Telekom [1] \u2013 some of you have contacted me about the central argument I develop in them.    My main point in both is that the remedy is not an afterthought that is irrelevant when establishing an infringement. The remedy \u2013 or, more precisely, what a finding of liability would entail \u2013 is central to determine whether there is a breach in the first place.    This statement is true as a matter of positive law \u2013 Van den Bergh Foods encapsulates the essence of the case law \u2013 and is also true from a normative standpoint \u2013 as the post on smartphones and cameras sought to explain.    The messages I have received following these posts are certainly sensible. How can the remedy determine the applicable legal test? Is it not getting the case backwards? Should we not establish an infringement first and then figure out the way to remedy it?    These questions, no doubt reasonable, are based on a fundamental assumption, which is that the finding of an infringement and a remedy are two separate steps, independent of one another.    I do not believe this assumption reflects the reality of the interaction between legal tests and remedies. More importantly, I do not believe the Court treats the infringement and the remedy as separate steps. They are rather two sides of the same coin.    The remedy reliably tells us what a case is about, and what the legal test is    A finding of infringement and a remedy are so closely intertwined that the single most reliable way to tell whether there is a competition law breach is to inquire about how to bring the alleged breach to an end.    In other words: to understand what a firm has done (and whether what it has done is prohibited), the best approach is to ask the claimant what the alleged infringer would need to do to comply with the law.    This point can be illustrated by reference to refusal to deal scenarios. These cases are not always easy to spot, and the lines are sometimes blurred between them and other legal categories, including tying and \u2018margin squeeze\u2019.    How to tell apart one category from the other? Inquire what the endgame would be. If the endgame is one in which a court or authority mandates (directly or indirectly, implicitly or explicitly) shared access to an input or an infrastructure, then the case raises the issues that are typical of refusal to deal cases. For the same reason, indispensability would be an element of the legal test.    Suppose, conversely, the remedy is a different one. For instance, an obligation not to require exclusivity from the firm\u2019s customers. If so, we would be in Hoffmann-La Roche and Intel territory (where nobody has ever thought of making indispensability an element of the legal test).    These statements are hardly revolutionary. It is, in essence, what the Court held in Van den Bergh Foods and then in TeliaSonera . In Van den Bergh Foods , the firm argued that indispensability was an element of the legal test. Both the General Court and the Court of Justice, in light of the endgame, concluded that the case belonged in the Hoffmann-La Roche / Intel family, and rejected the argument.    The remedy is routinely considered when calibrating the legal test    The history of competition law also teaches us that the remedy (that is, what the case would involve in practice) has been routinely considered when designing the appropriate legal test.    In particular, courts tend to craft strict legal tests where a finding of infringement would demand the administration of regulatory-like remedy (such as mandating access obligations and setting the terms and conditions under which access is to be granted).    Again, this idea is hardly revolutionary, and is part of our law. Why is indispensability part of the legal test in refusal to deal cases? Magill and Bronner seem to reflect deep awareness of the implications of a finding of infringement.    Think of Magill . Again, the question is: what is the endgame of ruling that a refusal to license copyright-protected information is abusive? Imposing a duty to license on the right holder. By definition, there is a tension between such an endgame and the logic of intellectual property systems (the very point of which the right to refuse to license).    It is not a surprise, against this background, that the Court confined to \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 the instances in which Article 102 TFEU can be relied upon to impose a duty to license (thereby minimising the tension with intellectual property systems).    The uncertainties and complexities of administering a remedy have als been mentioned as factors to consider when crafting a legal test. In his celebrated article on essential facilities, Phillip Areeda \u2013 the ultimate centrist in our field \u2013 expressed the view that \u2018[n]o court should impose a duty to deal that it cannot explain or adequately and reasonably supervise\u2019 and went on to warn against the imposition of regulatory-like obligations.    The EU experience shows that competition authorities do not fare much better than courts when it comes to the administration of these proactive remedies. The failure of the media player remedy in Microsoft I often comes up in these discussions. The principles-based approach to the question in Google Shopping and Android , and the resulting state of limbo (which appears to continue), another one.    Big Tech and legal tests: the question that will not go away    The discussion above gives, hopefully, a sense of what is going on, from a legal standpoint, in relation to Big Tech. Many of these cases demand regulatory-like intervention, and this, more frequently and more intensely than in the past.    It would seem that some competition authorities are more confident than they used to about their ability to redesign products and to tweak business models (other authorities, like the CMA, are more cautious, as the Final Report on digital advertising shows).    This increased confidence tends to trickle down into the interpretation of competition law provisions. The link between the nature of the remedy and the legal test, which acted as a limit on intervention, is now questioned (with the institutional implications that follow, in particular in a decentralised system). Fascinating, and potentially transformative, times.

That the economic cycle of boom and bust can never be ended. That you should sell shares in any company when a chief executive builds a bespoke new headquarters and demands that either a flag or a fountain is put outside the entrance. Out-of-control Goodwin had a fountain and flags, and a Tornado flypast in front of the Queen for the opening of RBS's Edinburgh HQ in 2005. Look what happened next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the single most useful insight that has stuck with me came from the successful chairman (they do exist) of a bank. Stupid questions, he pointed out, are usually the best questions in meetings. It takes confidence and sometimes even humility to ask them.</p><p>That came to mind watching tech-savvy media types mock the US senators who cross-examined the Facebookfounder and chief executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>in Washington this week. Who were these crumbly old dudes? One, Senator Orrin Hatch, 84, even asked <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>how, if his company's products were free, Facebookmade any money? What an idiot, Zuck's online fanbase crowed, while the bemused boss smirked and pointed out: \"Senator, we sell ads.\"</p><p>This time it was the tech-savvy who had missed the point. The senators are hardly perfect, but they are politicians who must navigate the currents of voter opinion and they understand what good barristers understand. Begin simply by asking the accused where he or she was on the night of the crime. Build up a picture, and steadily get the big themes on the record.</p><p>To many consumers who probably have not thought about it, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>\"we sell ads\" is a rather revealing and clear explanation of a supposedly miraculous business that was promoted by the tech community as the product of innate chino-clad genius. Facebooknever was a touchy-feely, do-good enterprise focused solely on \"community\", though. The collection of data, and using it to sell adverts and services over which it is now in trouble, is not an aberration. It is <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>entire business model.</p><p>Another simple question - \"Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?\" - got <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to wrestle uncomfortably in public with notions of privacy. Facebookknows where its billions of users stayed last night: why is that OK while the Facebookboss's movements are deemed private? One question produced the key admission, a dramatic and critical moment in the evolving history of the internet, in my view. Facebook, said <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>was responsible for the content on its platforms. Here he was, finally confessing to being a publisher, culpable like a conventional news service or book publisher for what he allows out there.</p><p>The idea, little more than two decades old, that the internet exists in a different and magical category, and that the people making billions out of selling ads against the content they allow to be published have no legal responsibility, was always daft. Yet it persisted, without governments, regulators or (until too late) the media asking what effect this would have on the public sphere.</p><p>We now know the outcome, with Russia having used Facebook's services to interfere in elections. The digital takeover also came close to wrecking the model by which the West's free and independent press funded itself, when the tech giants sucked up the overwhelming share of advertising by promising advertisers better access to consumers because big tech was and is spying on its own users.</p><p>It is in that context that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>grilling in Washington should be seen. We are only at the start of a long and overdue attempt to address a public policy disaster that will require years of work by legislators in the US, the EU and Britain to reform, and may lead to the break-up of the biggest technology firms to ensure competition.</p><p>An accompanying deluge of legal cases should be expected, as parents of children killed by young men radicalised after watching YouTube videos test the law, and victims of data theft or online bullying sue the publishers, the tech giants. It is a lawyer's dream. And then new laws will probably be required.</p><p>Throughout the complicated process of reform our politicians need to keep in mind the ethical and economic questions of the internet age. Do we work for the tech giants, or do they work for us? What is in the public interest? Who is in charge? What is for sale? And where is the money? There is another urgent imperative. Although the Facebookscandal deals with the mistakes of the past, for our own safety we should also be thinking about the ethics of the future. The rise of artificial intelligence and robotics will bring innovation, of course, but the Facebookscandal provides a textbook study in the dangers of over-enthusiastic groupthink. Better next time to ask questions early on about the law and ultimate responsibility before the self-programming and self-driving machines are programmed.</p><p>The consequences of omission can be serious. A failure to ask early on about the implications of others' actions is a fascinatingly common feature in man-made calamities. It was there in the inadequate provision of lifeboats on the Titanic; there too in the boom that preceded the 1929 crash, and in our own more recent financial crisis, and in what we can see now is the destruction of privacy resulting from the unimpeded rise of Facebookand Google.</p><p>Let's not add the unregulated artificial intelligence scandal of 2028 to the list. We have been warned.</p><p>The biggest tech firms may be broken up to ensure competition</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-136479577</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S34-8331-JBVM-Y27J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That the economic cycle of boom and bust can never be ended. That you should sell shares in any company when a chief executive builds a bespoke new headquarters and demands that either a flag or a fountain is put outside the entrance. Out-of-control Goodwin had a fountain and flags, and a Tornado flypast in front of the Queen for the opening of RBS's Edinburgh HQ in 2005. Look what happened next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the single most useful insight that has stuck with me came from the successful chairman (they do exist) of a bank. Stupid questions, he pointed out, are usually the best questions in meetings. It takes confidence and sometimes even humility to ask them.</p><p>That came to mind watching tech-savvy media types mock the US senators who cross-examined the Facebookfounder and chief executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>in Washington this week. Who were these crumbly old dudes? One, Senator Orrin Hatch, 84, even asked <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>how, if his company's products were free, Facebookmade any money? What an idiot, Zuck's online fanbase crowed, while the bemused boss smirked and pointed out: \"Senator, we sell ads.\"</p><p>This time it was the tech-savvy who had missed the point. The senators are hardly perfect, but they are politicians who must navigate the currents of voter opinion and they understand what good barristers understand. Begin simply by asking the accused where he or she was on the night of the crime. Build up a picture, and steadily get the big themes on the record.</p><p>To many consumers who probably have not thought about it, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>\"we sell ads\" is a rather revealing and clear explanation of a supposedly miraculous business that was promoted by the tech community as the product of innate chino-clad genius. Facebooknever was a touchy-feely, do-good enterprise focused solely on \"community\", though. The collection of data, and using it to sell adverts and services over which it is now in trouble, is not an aberration. It is <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>entire business model.</p><p>Another simple question - \"Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?\" - got <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to wrestle uncomfortably in public with notions of privacy. Facebookknows where its billions of users stayed last night: why is that OK while the Facebookboss's movements are deemed private? One question produced the key admission, a dramatic and critical moment in the evolving history of the internet, in my view. Facebook, said <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>was responsible for the content on its platforms. Here he was, finally confessing to being a publisher, culpable like a conventional news service or book publisher for what he allows out there.</p><p>The idea, little more than two decades old, that the internet exists in a different and magical category, and that the people making billions out of selling ads against the content they allow to be published have no legal responsibility, was always daft. Yet it persisted, without governments, regulators or (until too late) the media asking what effect this would have on the public sphere.</p><p>We now know the outcome, with Russia having used Facebook's services to interfere in elections. The digital takeover also came close to wrecking the model by which the West's free and independent press funded itself, when the tech giants sucked up the overwhelming share of advertising by promising advertisers better access to consumers because big tech was and is spying on its own users.</p><p>It is in that context that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>grilling in Washington should be seen. We are only at the start of a long and overdue attempt to address a public policy disaster that will require years of work by legislators in the US, the EU and Britain to reform, and may lead to the break-up of the biggest technology firms to ensure competition.</p><p>An accompanying deluge of legal cases should be expected, as parents of children killed by young men radicalised after watching YouTube videos test the law, and victims of data theft or online bullying sue the publishers, the tech giants. It is a lawyer's dream. And then new laws will probably be required.</p><p>Throughout the complicated process of reform our politicians need to keep in mind the ethical and economic questions of the internet age. Do we work for the tech giants, or do they work for us? What is in the public interest? Who is in charge? What is for sale? And where is the money? There is another urgent imperative. Although the Facebookscandal deals with the mistakes of the past, for our own safety we should also be thinking about the ethics of the future. The rise of artificial intelligence and robotics will bring innovation, of course, but the Facebookscandal provides a textbook study in the dangers of over-enthusiastic groupthink. Better next time to ask questions early on about the law and ultimate responsibility before the self-programming and self-driving machines are programmed.</p><p>The consequences of omission can be serious. A failure to ask early on about the implications of others' actions is a fascinatingly common feature in man-made calamities. It was there in the inadequate provision of lifeboats on the Titanic; there too in the boom that preceded the 1929 crash, and in our own more recent financial crisis, and in what we can see now is the destruction of privacy resulting from the unimpeded rise of Facebookand Google.</p><p>Let's not add the unregulated artificial intelligence scandal of 2028 to the list.

That the economic cycle of boom and bust can never be ended. That you should sell shares in any company when a chief executive builds a bespoke new headquarters and demands that either a flag or a fountain is put outside the entrance. Out-of-control Goodwin had a fountain and flags, and a Tornado flypast in front of the Queen for the opening of RBS's Edinburgh HQ in 2005. Look what happened next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the single most useful insight that has stuck with me came from the successful chairman (they do exist) of a bank. Stupid questions, he pointed out, are usually the best questions in meetings. It takes confidence and sometimes even humility to ask them.</p><p>That came to mind watching tech-savvy media types mock the US senators who cross-examined the Facebookfounder and chief executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>in Washington this week. Who were these crumbly old dudes? One, Senator Orrin Hatch, 84, even asked <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>how, if his company's products were free, Facebookmade any money? What an idiot, Zuck's online fanbase crowed, while the bemused boss smirked and pointed out: \"Senator, we sell ads.\"</p><p>This time it was the tech-savvy who had missed the point. The senators are not perfect, but they are politicians who must navigate the currents of voter opinion and they understand what good barristers understand. Begin simply by asking the accused where he or she was on the night of the crime. Build up a picture, and get the big themes on the record.</p><p>To many consumers who probably have not thought about it, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>\"we sell ads\" is a rather revealing and clear explanation of a supposedly miraculous business that was promoted by the tech community as the product of innate chino-clad genius. Facebooknever was a touchyfeely, do-good enterprise focused solely on \"community\", though. The collection of data, and using it to sell adverts and services over which it is now in trouble, is not an aberration. It is <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>entire business model.</p><p>Another simple question - \"Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?\" - got <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to wrestle uncomfortably in public with notions of privacy. Facebookknows where its billions of users stayed last night: why is that OK while the Facebookboss's movements are deemed private? One question produced the key admission, a dramatic and critical moment in the evolving history of the internet, in my view. Facebook, said <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>was responsible for the content on its platforms. Here he was, finally confessing to being a publisher, culpable like a conventional news service or book publisher for what he allows out there.</p><p>The idea, little more than two decades old, that the internet exists in a different and magical category, and that the people making billions out of selling ads against the content they allow to be published have no legal responsibility, was always daft. Yet it persisted, without governments, regulators or (until too late) the media asking what effect this would have on the public sphere.</p><p>We now know the outcome, with Russia having used Facebook's services to interfere in elections. The digital takeover also came close to wrecking the model by which the West's free and independent press funded itself, when the tech giants sucked up the overwhelming share of advertising by promising advertisers better access to consumers because big tech was and is spying on its own users.</p><p>It is in that context that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>grilling in Washington should be seen. We are only at the start of a long and overdue attempt to address a public policy disaster that will require years of work by legislators in the US, the EU and Britain to reform, and may lead to the break-up of the biggest technology firms to ensure competition.</p><p>An accompanying deluge of legal cases should be expected, as parents of children killed by young men radicalised after watching YouTube videos test the law, and victims of data theft or online bullying sue the publishers, the tech giants. It is a lawyer's dream.</p><p>Throughout the process of reform our politicians need to keep in mind the ethical and economic questions of the internet age. Do we work for the tech giants, or do they work for us? What is in the public interest? Who is in charge? What is for sale? There is another urgent imperative.</p><p>Although the Facebookscandal deals with the mistakes of the past, for our own safety we should also be thinking about the ethics of the future. The rise of artificial intelligence and robotics will bring innovation, of course, but the Facebookscandal provides a textbook study in the dangers of over-enthusiastic groupthink. Better next time to ask questions early on about the law and ultimate responsibility before the self-programming and self-driving machines are programmed.</p><p>The consequences of omission can be serious. A failure to ask early on about the implications of others' actions is a fascinatingly common feature in man-made calamities. It was there in the inadequate provision of lifeboats on the Titanic; there too in the boom that preceded the 1929 crash, and in our own more recent financial crisis, and in what we can see now is the destruction of privacy resulting from the unimpeded rise of Facebookand Google.</p><p>Let's not add the unregulated artificial intelligence scandal of 2028 to the list. We have been warned.</p><p>The biggest tech firms may be broken up to ensure competition</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-136482553</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S34-8331-JBVM-Y1K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Conventional macroeconomic models failed to predict the calamity or to provide a coherent explanation for it, and thus were unable to offer guidance on how to repair the damage. </p><p><br/><br/>Despite this, much of the profession remains in denial, hankering for a return to \u201cnormal\u201d and in effect treating the crisis as just a rude interruption.<br/><br/>That needs to change. Although an economic recovery has taken root, its structural fragility suggests that macroeconomics is still in pressing need of an overhaul. Three sets of lessons from the past decade stand out.<br/><br/>First, the presumption that economies are self-correcting, while tempting in good times, is unfounded and can have catastrophic consequences. The recovery of the past few years has lulled many into a false sense of security, because it was the result of unconventional policy responses that transcended mainstream \u201cgeneral equilibrium\u201d thinking.<br/><br/>Moreover, pre-crisis economic models are struggling to cope with the disruption unleashed by emerging digital technologies. The digital economy is characterized by increasing returns to scale, whereby Big Tech companies rapidly exploit network effects to dominate a growing array of markets. This has upended incumbent business models and transformed behavior in ways that have left macroeconomists and policymakers struggling to keep pace.<br/><br/>Consequently, the widespread belief that economic activity will follow a regular cycle around a stable growth trend is not very helpful beyond the very short term. Rather, the economic disruptions we are experiencing highlight an obvious fact, but one that prevailing models assume away: The future is fundamentally uncertain, and not all risks are quantifiable. <br/><br/>Precisely for that reason, we should reject the notion that emerged in the aftermath of the crisis that the world would enter a \u201cnew normal.\u201d In the face of evolving structural shifts in finance, technology, society, and politics, it is far more useful to think in terms of a \u201cNew Abnormal,\u201d in which economies are characterized by actual or latent structural instability.<br/><br/>The second lesson from the crisis is that balance sheets matter. The financialization of the global economy leaves national economies vulnerable to major corrections in asset prices that can render debt unserviceable. Macroeconomic models that focus on flows of income and spending ignore the critical role played by such wealth effects. Compounding the problem, these models are unable to predict asset prices, because the latter reflect investors\u2019 beliefs about future returns and risks. <br/><br/>Moreover, financial re-regulation since the crisis has not necessarily solved the balance-sheet problem. True, individual banks have become more resilient as a result of having to raise their capital and liquidity buffers substantially. But years of unprecedented monetary easing and large-scale asset purchases by central banks have encouraged risk-taking across the economic and financial system in ways that are harder to track and predict. In addition, policymakers\u2019 determination to limit taxpayers\u2019 exposure when financial institutions fail has led to risks being shifted onto investors through the use of instruments such as \u201cbail-in-able\u201d bonds. The systemic effects of such regulatory changes won\u2019t be clear until the next recession strikes.<br/><br/>Sustainable growth<br/><br/>There is also a growing recognition that financial balance sheets are not the only type that matter. As climate change and environmental degradation move up the political agenda, macroeconomists are beginning to appreciate the importance of other, less volatile forms of capital for growth and wellbeing. <br/><br/>In particular, they need to understand better the interaction of produced capital, whether tangible or intangible; human capital, including skills and knowledge; and natural capital, which includes the renewable and non-renewable resources and environment that support life.<br/><br/>Lastly, macroeconomists must recognize that distribution matters. Trying to model households\u2019 economic behavior on the basis of a single \u201crepresentative agent\u201d elides crucial differences in the experiences and behavior of people in different income and wealth brackets.<br/><br/>The fact that the rich disproportionately benefited from globalization and new technologies, not to mention from central banks\u2019 successful efforts to boost equity and bond prices after 2009, has arguably been a drag on growth. What is certain is that widening inequality has dramatically reduced support for mainstream politicians in favor of populists and nationalists. This in turn corroded the previous policy consensus that sustained fiscal probity, independent monetary policy, free trade, and the liberal movement of capital and labor.<br/><br/>The global backlash against the economic and political status quo has also targeted big business. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, financial institutions were in the firing line. But popular anger has since morphed into a general skepticism about corporate behavior, with the tech giants coming under particular scrutiny for alleged abuses of user data and monopoly power.<br/><br/>It would be too simplistic to view these tensions as the result of resentment toward the top 1 percent. There are substantial divisions within the remaining 99 percent between winners and losers from globalization. Moreover, divisions between countries have intensified as populists and nationalists blame foreigners for domestic economic and social problems. <br/><br/>Changes in global governance arrangements may disrupt business models, transform the institutional framework, and add a fresh layer of uncertainty to the economic outlook.<br/><br/>The macroeconomics profession has yet to come to terms with the most important lessons of the past decade. And without a new consensus on how to manage uncertainty, the world is uncomfortably vulnerable to fresh economic, social, and political shocks. <br/><br/>Mark Cliffe is Chief Economist and Head of Global Research of the ING Group.

He was there as the boss of a company that was co-started by archetypal geek-billionaire Bill Gates, and which has now run the entire cycle: from world-beating innovator, to evil empire, to has-been, and under Mr Nadella's leadership back to corporate wunderkind. The share price has risen four-fold since he took over in 2014. Microsoft is once again the world's most valuable listed company, as it was in 2000, and is one of only three worth US$1 trillion.</p><p>But 20 years ago, a US court judgment called Microsoft an \"abusive monopoly\" for using the domination over desktop PCs that it built up in the 1980s and '90s to squeeze customers while seeing off any potential rivals. It avoided a forced break-up, but then had to settle with the European Union in another huge monopoly case. Its share price flatlined after the dotcom bust, barely lifting from 2003 to 2013. At the turn of this decade it seemed to have been passed by in the world of smartphones, social media and giant digital platform companies like Amazon and Google.</p><p>The simple reason for recovery was a shift into cloud computing. But the real reason was because the Microsoft business rediscovered its core purpose and expertise in enterprise technology, growing only when its customers do well. Mr Nadella was not parachuted in to fix Microsoft. He reformed it as a consummate insider, there since 1992.</p><p>\"I was shaped by the company I grew up in, in all its goodness, and its issues,\" he told Chanticleer columnist Tony Boyd at the lunch co-hosted with the Business Council of Australia. The dependence of every company on technology means winning trust from customers, from regulators, and in the technology itself, at a time when the reputation of big tech is on the nose as Microsoft's once was. \"First, you have to get self-government right,\" he says. And it must also have taken some trust to let him disrupt Microsoft itself, moving from the legacy money-spinner of Windows into cloud computing, a low-margin business that was already dominated by somebody else. Now Microsoft has trumped cloud leader Amazon by winning a huge cloud project with the Pentagon.</p><p>After missing out on mobile, Mr Nadella admits, Microsoft could not lose out on cloud. He believes he picked the right one. Mobile devices come and go, \"but the one thing that won't go away is the broad computing fabric that stitches all this together\". He calls the cloud \"the world's computer\". That could mean the kind of overbearing power that got Microsoft into trouble before. But he says that big platform businesses are only stable if the value being created on the platform for customers is more than the value of the platform itself.</p><p>As the Financial Review reported on Monday, Microsoft has won high praise from both its investors and regulators alike - not people who always share the same interest in a company. Hamish Douglass of Magellan Partners has $US3.1 billion ($4.5 billion) of Microsoft stock, buying into a market for cloud services he believes will be worth trillions. Australian Consumer and Competition Commission chairman Rod Sims says that he does not view Microsoft in the same way as platforms like Google, which he has taken to court, and Facebook. Both have been the subject of critical reports by the ACCC. It is because they never take responsibility for what happens on their platforms, he says. \"I think Microsoft is a company that understands responsibility because they have been a broad business enterprise.\"</p><p>Firms come and go, and the same may happen to Microsoft again. But one of the information age's foundation companies has recovered by adapting its core competence and purpose in being embedded deep in the processes of its business customers. As with any company, how this can go will depend on how well Microsoft continues to be a trusted partner of its customers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7820sioh5dx62ndd62q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJB-GYD1-JD34-V3MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
