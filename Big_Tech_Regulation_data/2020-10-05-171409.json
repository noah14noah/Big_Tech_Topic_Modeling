The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p>\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\"</p><p>\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users \"increasingly extreme content\" that hardens their convictions, Cook said.</p><p>\"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\" he said. \"This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\"</p><p>Cook's appearance was one-up on his tech rivals and showed off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google. That is facilitated also by the fact that Apple makes most of its money by selling hardware like iPhones instead of ads based on user data.</p><p>\"With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\" said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance \"is going to have good currency,\" with officials, he added.</p><p>His speech comes a week after Apple unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai sent brief video remarks to the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs.</p><p>Zuckerberg said the social network takes seriously its \"basic ethical responsibility\" to safeguard personal information but added that \"the past year has shown we have a lot more work to do,\" referring to a big data breach and the scandal over the misuse of data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>He also said the company is investing in measures to beef up protection, including building a new tool to let users clear their browsing activity and deploying artificial intelligence to detect fake accounts and take down extremist content.</p><p>They both said they supported regulation, with Pichai noting Google recently proposed a legislative framework that would build on GDPR and extend many of its principles to users globally.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners , held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it launched GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook's data breach, which let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Kelvin Chan at <url

The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p>\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\"</p><p>\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users increasingly extreme content that hardens their convictions,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich only the companies that collect them,\" he said.</p><p>Cook's appearance seems set to one-up his tech rivals and show off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google.</p><p>\"With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\" said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance \"is going to have good currency,\" with officials, he added.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai were scheduled to address by video the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs. Only Cook attended in person.</p><p>He has repeatedly said privacy is a \"fundamental human right\" and vowed his company wouldn't sell ads based on customer data the way companies like Facebook do.</p><p>His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation efforts.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it beefed up data privacy regulations by launching GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Separately, the bloc's consumer protection chief has warned Facebook it could face sanctions for being slow to clarify the fine print in its terms of service concerning what happens to user data. And the EU competition chief has opened a preliminary investigation of Amazon over how it uses data from merchants.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people. It's also fighting a European order that it extend \"right to be forgotten\" rules to its search engines globally, in a battle pitting privacy concerns against the public's right to know. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p>\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\"</p><p>\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users \"increasingly extreme content\" that hardens their convictions, Cook said.</p><p>\"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\" he said. \"This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\"</p><p>Cook's appearance was one-up on his tech rivals and showed off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google. That is facilitated also by the fact that Apple makes most of its money by selling hardware like iPhones instead of ads based on user data.</p><p>\"With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\" said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance \"is going to have good currency,\" with officials, he added.</p><p>His speech comes a week after Apple unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai sent brief video remarks to the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs.</p><p>Zuckerberg said the social network takes seriously its \"basic ethical responsibility\" to safeguard personal information but added that \"the past year has shown we have a lot more work to do,\" referring to a big data breach and the scandal over the misuse of data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>He also said the company is investing in measures to beef up protection, including building a new tool to let users clear their browsing activity and deploying artificial intelligence to detect fake accounts and take down extremist content.</p><p>They both said they supported regulation, with Pichai noting Google recently proposed a legislative framework that would build on GDPR and extend many of its principles to users globally.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners , held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it launched GDPR.

Speaking at an international conference on data privacy, Apple CEO Tim Cook applauded European Union authorities for bringing in a strict new data privacy law this year and said the iPhone maker fully supports a U.S. federal privacy law.Cook's remarks, along with comments due later from Google and Facebook top bosses, in the European Union's home base in Brussels, underscore how the U.S. tech giants are jostling to curry favor in the region as regulators tighten their scrutiny. Data protection has become a major political issue worldwide, and European regulators have led the charge in setting new rules for the big internet companies. </p><p>The EU's new laws on data privacy require companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue. Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]'In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,' Cook said.'We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,' he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries. In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information 'has exploded into a data industrial complex.' 'Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,' he said. Cook's appearance seems set to one-up his tech rivals and show off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google.'With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,' said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance 'is going to have good currency,' with officials, he added.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai were scheduled to address by video the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs. Only Cook, who has been outspoken on protecting user privacy, attended in person.He has repeatedly said that privacy is a 'fundamental human right' and vowed his company wouldn't sell ads based on customer data the way companies like Facebook do. His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple through a new website and letting users make corrections. European users already had access to this feature after the continent's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation efforts. The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it beefed up data privacy regulations by launching GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars. In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access nearly 30 million accounts, including 3 million for EU users. Separately, the bloc's consumer protection chief has warned Facebook it could face sanctions for being slow to clarify the fine print in its terms of service concerning what happens to user data. And the EU competition chief has opened a preliminary investigation of Amazon over how it uses data from merchants. Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people. It's also fighting a European order that it extend 'right to be forgotten' rules to its search engines globally, in a battle pitting privacy concerns against the public's right to know.

The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p>\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\"</p><p>\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users \"increasingly extreme content\" that hardens their convictions, Cook said.</p><p>\"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\" he said. \"This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\"</p><p>Cook's appearance was one-up on his tech rivals and showed off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google. That is facilitated also by the fact that Apple makes most of its money by selling hardware like iPhones instead of ads based on user data.</p><p>\"With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\" said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance \"is going to have good currency,\" with officials, he added.</p><p>His speech comes a week after Apple unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai sent brief video remarks to the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs.</p><p>Zuckerberg said the social network takes seriously its \"basic ethical responsibility\" to safeguard personal information but added that \"the past year has shown we have a lot more work to do,\" referring to a big data breach and the scandal over the misuse of data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>He also said the company is investing in measures to beef up protection, including building a new tool to let users clear their browsing activity and deploying artificial intelligence to detect fake accounts and take down extremist content.</p><p>They both said they supported regulation, with Pichai noting Google recently proposed a legislative framework that would build on GDPR and extend many of its principles to users globally.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners , held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it launched GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook's data breach, which let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Kelvin Chan at <url

The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p>\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\"</p><p>\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users \"increasingly extreme content\" that hardens their convictions, Cook said.</p><p>\"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\" he said. \"This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\"</p><p>Cook's appearance was one-up on his tech rivals and showed off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google. That is facilitated also by the fact that Apple makes most of its money by selling hardware like iPhones instead of ads based on user data.</p><p>\"With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\" said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance \"is going to have good currency,\" with officials, he added.</p><p>His speech comes a week after Apple unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai sent brief video remarks to the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs.</p><p>Zuckerberg said the social network takes seriously its \"basic ethical responsibility\" to safeguard personal information but added that \"the past year has shown we have a lot more work to do,\" referring to a big data breach and the scandal over the misuse of data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>He also said the company is investing in measures to beef up protection, including building a new tool to let users clear their browsing activity and deploying artificial intelligence to detect fake accounts and take down extremist content.</p><p>They both said they supported regulation, with Pichai noting Google recently proposed a legislative framework that would build on GDPR and extend many of its principles to users globally.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners , held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it launched GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook's data breach, which let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5bd0f5f7985d4image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook applauds during a data privacy conference at the European Parliament in Brussels, Wednesday.

The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p>\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\"</p><p>\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users \"increasingly extreme content\" that hardens their convictions, Cook said.</p><p>\"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\" he said. \"This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\"</p><p>Cook's appearance was one-up on his tech rivals and showed off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google. That is facilitated also by the fact that Apple makes most of its money by selling hardware like iPhones instead of ads based on user data.</p><p>\"With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\" said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance \"is going to have good currency,\" with officials, he added.</p><p>His speech comes a week after Apple unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai sent brief video remarks to the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs.</p><p>Zuckerberg said the social network takes seriously its \"basic ethical responsibility\" to safeguard personal information but added that \"the past year has shown we have a lot more work to do,\" referring to a big data breach and the scandal over the misuse of data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>He also said the company is investing in measures to beef up protection, including building a new tool to let users clear their browsing activity and deploying artificial intelligence to detect fake accounts and take down extremist content.</p><p>They both said they supported regulation, with Pichai noting Google recently proposed a legislative framework that would build on GDPR and extend many of its principles to users globally.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners , held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it launched GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook's data breach, which let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Kelvin Chan at <url

It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\"</p><p>\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users increasingly extreme content that hardens their convictions,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich only the companies that collect them,\" he said. \"This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\"</p><p>Cook's appearance was one-up on his tech rivals and showed off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google.</p><p>\"With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\" said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance \"is going to have good currency,\" with officials, he added.</p><p>His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai sent brief video remarks to the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs.</p><p>Zuckerberg said the social network takes seriously its \"basic ethical responsibility\" to safeguard personal information but added that \"the past year has shown we have a lot more work to do,\" referring to a big data breach and the scandal over the misuse of data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>He also said the company is investing in measures to beef up protection, including building a new tool to let users clear their browsing activity and deploying artificial intelligence to detect fake accounts and take down extremist content.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it launched GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook's data breach, which let hackers access three million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-10/24/201848312542</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJX-2371-JDH1-C4NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"848\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday endorsed tough privacy laws for both Europe and the U.S. and renewed the technology giant\u2019s commitment to protecting personal data, which he warned was being \u201cweaponized\u201d against users.</p><p>Speaking at an international conference on data privacy, Cook applauded European Union authorities for bringing in a strict new data privacy law in May and said the iPhone maker supports a U.S. federal privacy law .</p><p> Cook\u2019s speech, along with video comments from Google and Facebook top bosses, in the European Union\u2019s home base in Brussels, underscores how the U.S. tech giants are jostling to curry favor in the region as regulators tighten their scrutiny.</p><p> Data protection has become a major political issue worldwide, and European regulators have led the charge in setting new rules for the big internet companies. The EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p> \u201cIn many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\u201d Cook said.</p><p> \u201cWe at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\u201d he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p> In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU\u2019s strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That\u2019s rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p> Cook warned that technology\u2019s promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \u201chas exploded into a data industrial complex.\u201d</p><p> \u201cOur own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\u201d he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users \u201cincreasingly extreme content\u201d that hardens their convictions, Cook said.</p><p> \u201cThis is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\u201d</p><p> Cook\u2019s appearance was one-up on his tech rivals and showed off his company\u2019s credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google. That is facilitated also by the fact that Apple makes most of its money by selling hardware like iPhones instead of ads based on user data.</p><p> \u201cWith the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\u201d said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook\u2019s appearance \u201cis going to have good currency,\u201d with officials, he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTIN-3531059</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHJ-7151-JBCN-43P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147871</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Austin American-Statesman (Texas)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>25 October 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. </p><p>That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information ``has exploded into a data industrial complex.''``Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,'' he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users increasingly extreme content that hardens their convictions,'' Cook said.``This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich only the companies that collect them,'' he said.Cook's appearance seems set to one-up his tech rivals and show off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google.``With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,'' said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance ``is going to have good currency,'' with officials, he added.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai were scheduled to address by video the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs. Only Cook attended in person.He has repeatedly said privacy is a ``fundamental human right'' and vowed his company wouldn't sell ads based on customer data the way companies like Facebook do.His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation efforts.The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it beefed up data privacy regulations by launching GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121540393732960251762900188</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJT-0PF1-DXN1-C0N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><timeReceived>3:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 24, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p>\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\"</p><p>\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users \"increasingly extreme content\" that hardens their convictions, Cook said.</p><p>\"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\" he said. \"This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\"</p><p>Cook's appearance was one-up on his tech rivals and showed off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google. That is facilitated also by the fact that Apple makes most of its money by selling hardware like iPhones instead of ads based on user data.</p><p>\"With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\" said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance \"is going to have good currency,\" with officials, he added.</p><p>His speech comes a week after Apple unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai sent brief video remarks to the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs.</p><p>Zuckerberg said the social network takes seriously its \"basic ethical responsibility\" to safeguard personal information but added that \"the past year has shown we have a lot more work to do,\" referring to a big data breach and the scandal over the misuse of data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>He also said the company is investing in measures to beef up protection, including building a new tool to let users clear their browsing activity and deploying artificial intelligence to detect fake accounts and take down extremist content.</p><p>They both said they supported regulation, with Pichai noting Google recently proposed a legislative framework that would build on GDPR and extend many of its principles to users globally.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners , held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it launched GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites.

Cook, meantime, has joined one of the most elite clubs for CEOs who didn't actually found the companies they run: his net worth has eclipsed $1 billion, according to calculations by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p><p>Cook's net worth estimate is based on an analysis of regulatory filings and applying the market performance of a typical wealthy investor to his proceeds from share sales. Cook, 59, said in 2015 that he plans to give most of his fortune away and has already gifted million of dollars worth of Apple shares. His wealth could be lower if he's made other undisclosed charitable gifts.</p><p>Josh Rosenstock, a spokesperson for Apple, declined to comment.</p><p>\"This tech cycle has been way bigger and longer than I thought,\" said Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures who expressed caution about Apple's long-term outlook after Jobs left the company. \"Out of all these stocks, Apple has become the greatest cash generation machine in history.\"</p><p>FAANG stocks</p><p>Apple's market value and Cook's riches reflect the rise of the FAANG stocks, a phrase that didn't even exist in the Jobs era. It also comes as Cook and his fellow Big Tech CEOs - Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc., Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc. and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc. - face antitrust investigations into what their critics characterize as monopolistic powers.</p><p>While Bezos and Zuckerberg have huge stakes in the companies they founded, Cook's path to the 10-figure-club was more incremental. The vast majority of his estimated wealth comes from equity awards he's received since joining Apple in 1998, where he has drawn plaudits for mastering the company's complex supply chain.</p><p>He got a massive award of restricted shares on his first day as CEO. The equity has paid out in annual increments, with part contingent on Apple's stock outperforming at least two-thirds of firms in the S&amp;P 500. Barring a sudden drop in Apple's stock price, Cook is poised to receive his ninth payout from the award, consisting of 560,000 shares, later this month.</p><p>Around half of those will likely be withheld for taxes, but the remainder should boost Cook's fortune by another $100 million. He currently owns 847,969 shares directly, or about 0.02 per cent of Apple shares, worth around $375 million. Proceeds from previous share sales, dividends and other compensation add another $650 million to his net worth, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Apple stock rose 1.45 per cent to $450.91 at market's close on Monday.</p><p>Mammoth positions</p><p>Cook's stake is small compared with the mammoth positions founders like Bezos, Zuckerberg and Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk control at their respective companies. Apple shares are distributed widely among different investors and executives, so the world's most valuable company has minted very few billionaires among its employees.</p><p>When Jobs stepped down in August 2011 and died soon after, Cook had already filled in as interim CEO on several occasions. But investors and analysts were concerned that Apple wouldn't be able to innovate as much as it did in the past.</p><p>While Apple over the past decade hasn't revealed a new product as groundbreaking as the iPhone, the company still has thrived.</p><p>Cook has overseen the development of devices like the iPhone X and Apple Watch, new services like Apple Music, and research on new frontiers like self-driving cars and augmented-reality glasses.</p><p>Even the pandemic, which has hammered many other parts of the economy, has been a boon to Apple and other big tech companies as people have gotten even more reliant on their products and services.</p><p>Their recent success stands in contrast to the economic upheaval caused by the coronavirus: a growing string of bankruptcies, tens of millions unemployed and massive public deficits.</p><p>When Apple reported results recently, Cook acknowledged the hardship facing legions of families and businesses.</p><p>\"We do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity,\" he said on a conference call. \"Especially in times like this, we are focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn't just our success.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2020081158581918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JV-2VX1-JDH1-C00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Cook, meantime, has joined one of the most elite clubs for CEOs who didn't actually found the companies they run: his net worth has eclipsed $1 billion, according to calculations by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p><p>Cook's net worth estimate is based on an analysis of regulatory filings and applying the market performance of a typical wealthy investor to his proceeds from share sales. Cook, 59, said in 2015 that he plans to give most of his fortune away and has already gifted million of dollars worth of Apple shares. His wealth could be lower if he's made other undisclosed charitable gifts.</p><p>Josh Rosenstock, a spokesperson for Apple, declined to comment.</p><p>\"This tech cycle has been way bigger and longer than I thought,\" said Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures who expressed caution about Apple's long-term outlook after Jobs left the company. \"Out of all these stocks, Apple has become the greatest cash generation machine in history.\"</p><p>FAANG stocks</p><p>Apple's market value and Cook's riches reflect the rise of the FAANG stocks, a phrase that didn't even exist in the Jobs era. It also comes as Cook and his fellow Big Tech CEOs - Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc., Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc. and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc. - face antitrust investigations into what their critics characterize as monopolistic powers.</p><p>While Bezos and Zuckerberg have huge stakes in the companies they founded, Cook's path to the 10-figure-club was more incremental. The vast majority of his estimated wealth comes from equity awards he's received since joining Apple in 1998, where he has drawn plaudits for mastering the company's complex supply chain.</p><p>He got a massive award of restricted shares on his first day as CEO. The equity has paid out in annual increments, with part contingent on Apple's stock outperforming at least two-thirds of firms in the S&amp;P 500. Barring a sudden drop in Apple's stock price, Cook is poised to receive his ninth payout from the award, consisting of 560,000 shares, later this month.</p><p>Around half of those will likely be withheld for taxes, but the remainder should boost Cook's fortune by another $100 million. He currently owns 847,969 shares directly, or about 0.02 per cent of Apple shares, worth around $375 million. Proceeds from previous share sales, dividends and other compensation add another $650 million to his net worth, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Apple stock rose 1.45 per cent to $450.91 at market's close on Monday.</p><p>Mammoth positions</p><p>Cook's stake is small compared with the mammoth positions founders like Bezos, Zuckerberg and Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk control at their respective companies. Apple shares are distributed widely among different investors and executives, so the world's most valuable company has minted very few billionaires among its employees.</p><p>When Jobs stepped down in August 2011 and died soon after, Cook had already filled in as interim CEO on several occasions. But investors and analysts were concerned that Apple wouldn't be able to innovate as much as it did in the past.</p><p>While Apple over the past decade hasn't revealed a new product as groundbreaking as the iPhone, the company still has thrived.</p><p>Cook has overseen the development of devices like the iPhone X and Apple Watch, new services like Apple Music, and research on new frontiers like self-driving cars and augmented-reality glasses.</p><p>Even the pandemic, which has hammered many other parts of the economy, has been a boon to Apple and other big tech companies as people have gotten even more reliant on their products and services.</p><p>Their recent success stands in contrast to the economic upheaval caused by the coronavirus: a growing string of bankruptcies, tens of millions unemployed and massive public deficits.</p><p>When Apple reported results recently, Cook acknowledged the hardship facing legions of families and businesses.</p><p>\"We do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity,\" he said on a conference call. \"Especially in times like this, we are focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn't just our success.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020081158582768</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JV-2W51-JBTY-W01K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

You just watch,\" Trump insisted to Wade Crowfoot, the head of the California Natural Resources Agency.</p><p>The official responded: \"I wish science agreed with you.\"</p><p>\"I don't think science knows, actually,\" Trump said.</p><p>It was Trump's first visit to California since the devastating blazes began there and in the states of Washington and Oregon.</p><p>Democratic challenger Joe Biden has branded Trump a \"climate arsonist\" whose policies contribute to natural disasters.</p><p>The Apple chief executive also said he hoped his testimony in July to a House of Representatives panel investigating market dominance put to rest worries that the iPhone maker wields monopoly power of any sort.</p><p>Big Tech executives faced an onslaught of criticism from US lawmakers at the high-stakes antitrust hearing, which could lay the groundwork for tougher regulation of the major internet platforms.</p><p>CEOs Cook, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google were grilled for more than five hours in the unprecedented joint appearance \u2013 by video.</p><p>\"I have no issue at all in Apple being put underneath the microscope,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"My hope is that as people heard our story and as they continue to hear our story, that it will become as apparent to them as it is to us that we have no monopoly.\"</p><p>Cook diplomatically responded when asked his thoughts on the response to Covid-19, saying the virus \"took the world by surprise\" and recounting Apple efforts to help with masks and more.</p><p>He said that some 85% of Apple employees are working remotely due to the pandemic, and it remained unclear when they would be able to return to company headquarters in Cupertino, California.</p><p>source: AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALINWS-1600761744002563500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALINWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WS-T211-DY4B-C3WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414547</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><timeReceived>08:02 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Alliance News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alliance News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"34670\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 22, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Speaking at an international conference on data privacy, Apple CEO Tim Cook applauded European Union authorities for bringing in a strict new data privacy law in May and said the iPhone maker supports a U.S. federal privacy law . Cook's speech, along with video comments from Google and Facebook top bosses, in the European Union's home base in Brussels, underscores how the U.S. tech giants are jostling to curry favor in the region as regulators tighten their scrutiny. Data protection has become a major political issue worldwide, and European regulators have led the charge in setting new rules for the big internet companies. </p><p>The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue. \"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said. \"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries. In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently. Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\" \"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. \"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\" he said. \"This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\" Cook's appearance was one-up on his tech rivals and showed off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google. That is helped by the fact that Apple makes most of its money by selling hardware like iPhones instead of ads based on user data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN61296385</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKS-J131-DYRV-44BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Whoever's telling you that, it's a bunch of bunk.\"</p><p>Cook's remarks come at a pivotal time for Silicon Valley. In the past year, technology companies and their executives have come under unprecedented scrutiny from elected officials and regulators stemming from a variety of issues, including a barrage of data privacy scandals, accusations of toxic corporate culture, the negative impact of tech platforms on political debate, and concerns over tech overuse and addiction. In recent months, growing calls from Capitol Hill have boosted the prospects of new legislation aimed at big tech companies.</p><p>Last week, Facebook disclosed that hackers stole information that could have allowed them to compromise over 50 million user accounts.</p><p>The massive data breach was yet another blow to Facebook's reputation, as the company is still reeling from its Cambridge Analytica crisis, and from its role in a Russia-backed misinformation campaign designed to influence the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, called the breach \"deeply concerning\" and repeated his calls for Congress to pass new data privacy laws.</p><p>Just days before the breach was announced, members of Congress questioned representatives from Google, Twitter and several telecom companies regarding user privacy. The companies were largely unwilling to commit to specific privacy rules and instead pledged to work with the Senate Commerce Committee on a comprehensive national privacy law.</p><p>Cook said in the interview that he is \"exceedingly optimistic\" that the topic of data privacy has reached an elevated level of public debate. \"When the free market doesn't produce a result that's great for society you have to ask yourself what do we need to do. And I think some level of government regulation is important to come out on that.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGE-376536603FRDG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGLR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDG-4711-JCT2-K3FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"422\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Daily Gleaner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Gleaner (New Brunswick)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 4, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>apple,chief,executive,urged,consumers,believe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM3E</classCode><className>DATA THEFT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

Cook, meantime, has joined one of the most elite clubs for CEOs who didn't actually found the companies they run: his net worth has eclipsed US$1 billion, according to calculations by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p><p>Cook's net worth estimate is based on an analysis of regulatory filings and applying the market performance of a typical wealthy investor to his proceeds from share sales. Cook, 59, said in 2015 that he plans to give most of his fortune away and has already gifted million of dollars worth of Apple shares. His wealth could be lower if he's made other undisclosed charitable gifts.</p><p>Josh Rosenstock, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment.</p><p>\"This tech cycle has been way bigger and longer than I thought,\" said Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures who expressed caution about Apple's long-term outlook after Jobs left the company. \"Out of all these stocks, Apple has become the greatest cash generation machine in history.\"</p><p>Apple's market value and Cook's riches reflect the rise of the FAANG stocks, a phrase that didn't even exist in the Jobs era. It also comes as Cook and his fellow Big Tech CEOs - Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc., Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc. and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc. - face antitrust investigations into what their critics characterize as monopolistic powers.</p><p>While Bezos and Zuckerberg have huge stakes in the companies they founded, Cook's path to the 10-figure-club was more incremental.</p><p>The vast majority of his estimated wealth comes from equity awards he's received since joining Apple in 1998, where he has drawn plaudits for mastering the company's complex supply chain.</p><p>He got a massive award of restricted shares on his first day as CEO. The equity has paid out in annual increments, with part of them contingent on Apple's stock outperforming at least two-thirds of firms in the S&amp;;P 500. Barring a sudden drop in Apple's stock price, Cook is poised to receive his ninth payout from the award, consisting of 560,000 shares, later this month.</p><p>Around half of those will likely be withheld for taxes but the remainder should boost Cook's fortune by another US$100 million. He currently owns 847,969 shares directly, or about 0.02 per cent of Apple shares, worth around US$375 million.</p><p>Proceeds from previous share sales, dividends and other compensation add another US$650 million to his net worth, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Apple stock rose 1.6 per cent to US$451.82 in late-afternoon trading on Monday.</p><p>Cook's stake is small compared with the mammoth positions founders like Bezos, Zuckerberg and Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk control at their respective companies.

Cook, meantime, has joined one of the most elite clubs for CEOs who didn't actually found the companies they run: his net worth has eclipsed US$1 billion, according to calculations by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p><p>Cook's net worth estimate is based on an analysis of regulatory filings and applying the market performance of a typical wealthy investor to his proceeds from share sales. Cook, 59, said in 2015 that he plans to give most of his fortune away and has already gifted million of dollars worth of Apple shares. His wealth could be lower if he's made other undisclosed charitable gifts.</p><p>Josh Rosenstock, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment.</p><p>\"This tech cycle has been way bigger and longer than I thought,\" said Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures who expressed caution about Apple's long-term outlook after Jobs left the company. \"Out of all these stocks, Apple has become the greatest cash generation machine in history.\"</p><p>Apple's market value and Cook's riches reflect the rise of the FAANG stocks, a phrase that didn't even exist in the Jobs era. It also comes as Cook and his fellow Big Tech CEOs - Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc., Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc. and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc. - face antitrust investigations into what their critics characterize as monopolistic powers.</p><p>While Bezos and Zuckerberg have huge stakes in the companies they founded, Cook's path to the 10-figure-club was more incremental. The vast majority of his estimated wealth comes from equity awards he's received since joining Apple in 1998, where he has drawn plaudits for mastering the company's complex supply chain.</p><p>He got a massive award of restricted shares on his first day as CEO. The equity has paid out in annual increments, with part of them contingent on Apple's stock outperforming at least twothirds of firms in the S&amp;;P 500. Barring a sudden drop in Apple's stock price, Cook is poised to receive his ninth payout from the award, consisting of 560,000 shares, later this month.</p><p>Around half of those will likely be withheld for taxes but the remainder should boost Cook's fortune by another US$100 million. He currently owns 847,969 shares directly, or about 0.02 per cent of Apple shares, worth around US$375 million. Proceeds from previous share sales, dividends and other compensation add another US$650 million to his net worth, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Apple stock rose 1.6 per cent to US$451.82 in late-afternoon trading on Monday.</p><p>Cook's stake is small compared with the mammoth positions founders like Bezos, Zuckerberg and Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk control at their respective companies. Apple shares are distributed widely among different investors and executives, so the world's most valuable company has minted very few billionaires among its employees.</p><p>When Jobs stepped down in August 2011 and died soon after, Cook had already filled in as interim CEO on several occasions. But investors and analysts were concerned that Apple wouldn't be able to innovate as much as it did in the past.</p><p>While Apple over the past decade hasn't revealed a new product as groundbreaking as the iPhone, the company still has thrived. Cook has overseen the development of devices like the iPhone X and Apple Watch, new services like Apple Music, and research on new frontiers like self-driving cars and augmented-reality glasses.</p><p>Even the pandemic, which has hammered many other parts of the economy, has been a boon to Apple and other big tech companies as people have gotten even more reliant on their products and services.</p><p>Their recent success stands in contrast to the economic upheaval caused by the coronavirus: a growing string of bankruptcies, tens of millions unemployed and massive public deficits.</p><p>When Apple reported results recently, Cook acknowledged the hardship facing legions of families and businesses.</p><p>\"We do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity,\" he said on a conference call. \"Especially in times like this, we are focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn't just our success.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Whoever's telling you that, it's a bunch of bunk.\"</p><p>Cook's remarks come at a pivotal time for Silicon Valley. In the past year, technology companies and their executives have come under unprecedented scrutiny from elected officials and regulators stemming from a variety of issues, including a barrage of data privacy scandals, accusations of toxic corporate culture, the negative impact of tech platforms on political debate, and concerns over tech overuse and addiction. In recent months, growing calls from Capitol Hill have boosted the prospects of new legislation aimed at big tech companies.</p><p>Last week, Facebook disclosed that hackers stole information that could have allowed them to compromise over 50 million user accounts. The massive data breach was yet another blow to Facebook's reputation, as the company is still reeling from its Cambridge Analytica crisis, and from its role in a Russia-backed misinformation campaign designed to influence the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, called the breach \"deeply concerning\" and repeated his calls for Congress to pass new data privacy laws.</p><p>Just days before the breach was announced, members of Congress questioned representatives from Google, Twitter and several telecom companies regarding user privacy. The companies were largely unwilling to commit to specific privacy rules and instead pledged to work with the Senate Commerce Committee on a comprehensive national privacy law.</p><p>Cook said in the interview that he is \"exceedingly optimistic\" that the topic of data privacy has reached an elevated level of public debate. \"When the free market doesn't produce a result that's great for society you have to ask yourself what do we need to do. And I think some level of government regulation is important to come out on that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-10/03/201848032428</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDD-NFC1-F103-30R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"414\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Speaking at an international conference on data privacy, Apple CEO Tim Cook applauded European Union authorities for bringing in a strict new data privacy law this year and said the iPhone maker supports a US federal privacy law.

'In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,' Cook said. 'We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,' he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries. In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently. Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information 'has exploded into a data industrial complex.' 'Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,' he said.

Cook's appearance 'is going to have good currency,' with officials, he added. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai were scheduled to address by video the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs. Only Cook attended in person. He has repeatedly said privacy is a 'fundamental human right' and vowed his company wouldn't sell ads based on customer data the way companies like Facebook do. His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide. The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation efforts. The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it beefed up data privacy regulations by launching GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use. GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars. In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access 3 million EU accounts. Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, June 5th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning. We are remembering D-Day, which is tomorrow. President Trump spoke moments ago at the 75th anniversary event in the U.K., reading a prayer originally read by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the night of June 6th, 1944.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tariffs on Mexico set to go into effect in five days. Vice President Mike Pence will meet with Mexican officials today at the White House to try to make a deal before that happens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A rate cut is now on the table officially. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell said that the central bank could take action if the trade battle escalates. That sparked a huge rally on Wall Street yesterday and that continues this morning.</p><p>Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 167 points. That's two-thirds of 1 percent. The S&amp;P is up 20. And the Nasdaq is up 61 as you see.</p><p>Next hour we will be getting the may ADP report. The expectation is for 180,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of May.</p><p>This after a big rally on Wall Street yesterday on the Powell comments -- take a look. The Dow Industrials finishing up 512 points. That was better than 2 percent. The S&amp;P was up better than 2 percent, 58 points higher. And the Nasdaq up two and two thirds percent. That was 194 points higher on the Nasdaq yesterday. All on the idea that the Fed could in fact cut rates at some point this year.</p><p>In Europe this morning, gains there as well. FT 100 is up two thirds of a percent, 44 points. The CAC in Paris is up 36. That's two-thirds of a percent. And the DAX index up 68 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed but as you can see, Japan was the best performer, up 1.8 percent on the Nikkei average.</p><p>China is hitting Ford Motor now with a fine. What that means for the trade fight coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; market strategist at ThirdSeven Advisors Michael Block; and Fox News contributor, attorney Emily Compagno. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRDSEVEN ADVISORS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We've got a lot --</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Can we talk about markets really quickly --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- before we move on to the D-Day commemoration which again is the most important thing.</p><p>But in terms of follow through, I'm kind of -- are you surprised that the markets are following through a little bit after the Fed speak yesterday? Because I was listening really closely to what Brian Moynihan was saying, no rate cut this year. But there are a lot of other people -- Barclays, the economists there now think the Fed is going to cut rates by half a percentage point in September. And then another 25 basis point cut later in the year. That's kind of incredible for an economy for the most part that looks really solid right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It all depends on this trade fight because, you know, we'll see. I mean look what China's doing now. Now, it's messing with Ford Motor. It harassed FedEx last week. It's threatening that it's going to stop the rare earth minerals from getting imported to the U.S. So the fight with China worsens and now we've got this Mexico uncertainty.</p><p>BLOCK: Remember, Mr. Moynihan is doing his job as CEO of one of the largest banks in the world, saying everything is going along reasonably well. There's no need to cut rates here.</p><p>There's others who are more academic and are saying well, if the unemployment rate is x, then maybe we don't need to cut rates. Remember that James Board (Ph) from the St. Louis fed said the other day, low unemployment rate is not a reason in this situation to not cut rates because there's other things going on.</p><p>And then we have a dysfunctional market here. This yield curve is telling us that something is amiss here. We could say this time it's different. We could say it's not a real signal, doesn't matter anymore. The point is, it is affecting the market and the economic psychology out there.</p><p>The Fed cutting rates may help alleviate some of that psychosis, if you will, and that's a big part of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, maybe it's sentiment. But I mean look at the actual data points. You've got unemployment at 3.6 percent. We're going to get the ADP number out in a an hour and 10 minutes. And we're expecting to see 180,000 jobs created in the month of May and the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.6 percent.</p><p>I recognize the PMI, the purchasing manager's index is showing some weakness certainly on a global basis. And then you have the question, can the U.S. continue growing this way with the rest of the world slowing down? But is it that dire that we need a rate cut?</p><p>BLOCK: The rate cut is a matter of instilling confidence and undoing some of the dysfunction in the market. That's the way I look at it. When I talk to professionals, guys who run a lot of money say in the credit sector, they say that the December hike was a mistake. It was done on some backward looking data, and perhaps it shouldn't have been done. This would help undo that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: it But it has to be pretty would have to be pretty dire for the fed to cut rates. The only example when it wasn't the case, when it wasn't obvious that a recession was on the horizon or that was real instability in the financial markets was going back to 1995.</p><p>That came after the fed had raised short-term interest rates by 3 percentage points in a single year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Then they reversed course, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. So it's been a number of years and then, by the way, that was in -- it was also the last two jobs reports preceding that fed interest rate cut were actually we saw job destruction in those months. So that was one of the reasons.</p><p>So you would have to see -- the Federal Reserve is not cutting rates if we're getting six figure job increases every month and inflation is still at 1.6 percent, although that's low.</p><p>You have the tariffs which could increase inflation and then unemployment is low and you've got wage growth the fastest pace in a decade. This is not the backdrop of a fed that cuts rates and the market thinks it's going to happen. I'm like you better watch out. The yield curve still was inverted yesterday despite the selling and longer term treasuries and the yields going up. It still remained inverted.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the 10-year is lower than a lot of them. So what yield are you looking at that's most important? Because if you look at even the three month, that's at 2.4, 2.5 percent, versus the 2.07 that you're looking at the 10 year. What yield do you look at that's most important in terms of -- versus the 10 year?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think you watch the 10 year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 10-year versus what though.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Even the 10-year versus the fed funds rate.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's two and-a-half.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I still don't think the Fed cuts rates here even though the yield curve is inverted. I still don't think the Federal Reserve cuts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't think so either. It's not warranted with the economy that's growing and producing all of these jobs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But watch -- even just watch the fed funds raised 2.25, 2.5 watch the 10-year once it gets back above maybe -- maybe it's today, gets back above that 2.25 percent, that would be a healthy sign, right-- Mike?</p><p>BLOCK: Look, right now -- right now, that three-month to 10-year spread is signaling recession right now. We could say that's not possible. That's what the market is telling us right now. The fear is this becomes a self fulfilling prophecy, the data heads south. That's what I'm thinking about. I think that's what the Fed is telling us they want to focus on here. Let's see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's the 10 year at 2.13 percent. And as you say, the others are higher than this at 2.25 to 2.5 percent.</p><p>We are also remembering America's heroes this morning. Just moments ago President Trump delivered a tribute to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day. He read from Roosevelt's D-Day prayer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All mighty God, our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our republic, our religion, and our civilization and to set free a suffering humanity. They will need thy blessings for the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces but we shall return again and again. And we know that by thy grace and by the righteous of our cause, our sons will triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, getting the chills as he reads that prayer. Joining me now, Fox News contributor, former speaker of the house, and the author of \"Collusion\", Newt Gingrich is here. Good to see you -- Newt. Thanks very much for weighing in this morning.</p><p>Quite the commemorative ceremony happening this morning in the U.K. as we look ahead to tomorrow, June 6th and the anniversary of D-Day, 75years ago.</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I actually did a podcast on D-Day and President Roosevelt's prayer. The whole prayer runs much longer than they had time for this morning. But I thought President Trump delivered the heart of it really, really well.</p><p>And hopefully it reminds people that, you know, in 1944 this was seen as a spiritual crusade. You had the Nazis who were anti-God trying to create a secular dictatorship. And it was seen as a struggle for the survival of our civilization.</p><p>And tomorrow represents the 75th anniversary of the biggest gamble ever taken by humans beings. There is no other project the size and complexity of the Normandy invasion. And it was a remarkable human achievement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good way to put it.</p><p>Let me ask you about the Trump economy -- Newt. We want to look at these new Fox News polls, showing the President received positive job ratings on his handling of the economy. The President tweeted this this morning -- Newt. If the totally corrupt media was less corrupt I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy, maybe the best ever. If the corrupt media was actually fair I would be up by 25 points. Nevertheless, despite the fake news, we are doing great.\"</p><p>Newt -- you know, we're over here this morning debating whether or not we're going to see a rate cut. The economy is going strong. I mean you've got have 3.6 percent unemployment. And we're going to get the ADP numbers to show more job growth in the month of May within the next hour.</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, but let me offer you a contrarian view. I really think the Fed ought to focus on money. If you have no inflation, then you ought to be relatively passive. And if you have a big increase in productivity which is going to happen you can actually afford to cut rates just not because you're trying to stimulate the economy, but because you actually don't need to send any signal that money ought to be more expensive.</p><p>I mean money's expensiveness is a function of projected inflation. And what Trump has managed to pull off so far is substantial economic growth while fighting with some of our trading partners, while really working at profound deregulation. And so he's got a relatively stable monetary environment with continued increase in employment and wage increase which is very, very important to bring the middle class back into the game.</p><p>BLOCK: Mr. Speaker -- Mike Block here. Good morning. So what does this all mean? In light of what you just said, what do you think could happen here with the trade situation with Mexico, which is on everyone's mind over the past few days? Do you think that tariffs will go into place? Do you think a deal can be reached here? Do you think that's very important to this economic engine continuing?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yes. I think a deal will probably be reached. And again, frankly, the President ought to put the focus right on the Congress. We wouldn't be in this mess, he wouldn't be having to muscle the Mexicans if the U.S. Congress would do its job. The whole premise that Trump worked on for two and-a-half years was build a wall, protect the United States, don't bother your neighbor.</p><p>But if the congress refuses to do its job, and he is determined to cut off the flow of illegal immigration, which by the way has grown dramatically in the last year, then you've got to pressure the number one source which is Mexico.</p><p>I mean, all of these people coming up to the border are coming up to the border through Mexico. And if the Mexicans wanted to, they could control all of that. Historically, they haven't wanted to particularly.</p><p>And so I think he looked around for the only tool he had, which was to scare the Mexicans with a tariff and he said look, trying to get control of our border and trying to stop illegal immigration is more important than the short-term economic side effect of a tariff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH: I mean plus remember, Trump is a very good negotiator who always starts very tough and then goes back to being reasonable.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the Republicans are threatening to block -- the Republicans are threatening to block any tariffs on Mexico and we should point out that one of the ministers in Mexico yesterday said that he sees an 80 percent chance of avoiding any U.S. tariffs. It feels like it's bluster. That's how I saw it from the get-go. But we'll see, you know.</p><p>I mean he made the threat. He's got to stick to it if in fact they don't come up with a substantial answer to the border crisis.</p><p>Mk1: I think Vice President Pence will end up with a positive announcement. It will take substantial steps in the right direction which they should. But at the same time, I would point out whether or not even with the Republicans and the Senate in rebellion, whether or not they could override a presidential veto is not at all clear to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Newt it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>GINGRICH: Great. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Newt Gingrich joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, hitting an American icon: Ford in the middle as tensions between the U.S. and China intensify. The details coming up next.</p><p>Then Tim Cook is pushing back, the CEO of Apple denying a monopoly. Coming up, right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A big change for Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign staff.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with details now and headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria -- the 2020 hopeful allowing her campaign staff to unionize. She's green lighted a request by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to represent her employees. Senator warren now the third Democratic presidential candidate to allow this, following Senator Bernie Sanders and former HUD secretary Julian Castro.</p><p>Well, a Florida state trooper the victim of a dramatic hit and run. There's the video. Trooper Arsenio Caballero (ph) hit on Florida turnpike in Broward County last month. He was assisted another trooper during a traffic stop. He's ok. I just want to say that before I get to the end. A white sedan slammed into Caballero as he walked back to his vehicle. He was rushed to the hospital. He is now at home.</p><p>So again, looks like he's going to be ok. But police are working to track down that driver.</p><p>Well, it was no laughing matter for comedian Tracy Morgan after his new, brand-new $2 million sports car was involved in a minor accident in New York City. New video shows Morgan not taking it lightly. He banged on the other car after he stood up on his own luxury Bugatti trying to get out. The fender bender happened about an hour after he had driven the car, Maria, off of the lot. Nobody was injured.</p><p>And then there is this -- Jeff Bezos is heading to Fifth Avenue. The amazon CEO is buying three apartments for a cool $80 million. This is one of the richest deals in Manhattan real estate, according to the \"Wall Street Journal\". He's buying the penthouse and two units directly underneath it in a 1912 neo-gothic building. If turned into a single family home, the three units would total more than 17,0000 square feet Maria, with 12 bedrooms. Not your average New York City apartment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he's got the money to do it, that's for sure.</p><p>CASONE: He sure does.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He was apparently looking at one of these apartments, a penthouse in on e of these new building in West Chelsea. I'm so glad he's not living in my neighborhood. Because again, can you imagine the traffic with his entourage and all his security. At least he isn't moving into one of these billionaire towers which are in midtown which are literally the ugliest buildings put up in New York City ever. Like the one that ken griffin, hedge fund manager, that's the top price.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do we know where his new building is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it's on Madison Square Park.</p><p>BLOCK: 212 Fifth Avenue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: 212 Fifth Avenue -- so at least it's an older building, I'll say that.</p><p>Can we talk about the car, though? Because you drive someone tells me a '72 Ford.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Ford Mackline. So are we talking about the Bugatti or the China fight with Ford..</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, if somebody hit your car, how would you react? Emily Compagno -- I want to know.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tracy Morgan was probably calm by comparison. I just think it's like Murphy's Law. But you know, he just got a $90 million settlement from Walmart. But yes, some of the shelves and panels on the car alone are $250,000. So even though it's a fender bender, it's not such when you're actually talking about the price tag of the damage. And of course, it's huge dent in the value of the car but obviously, it's probably not getting it for resale value. . It's just an tunfortunate circumstance for him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will tell you this, if you bought my car, even my used Porsche that I drive, I will fall up on the hood of your car and it would damage it. I am very -- I weigh a lot more than people probably think. And I'm pretty stout.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're not going to dent the car. You're not going to dent the car. You're not that heavy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have fallen on the hood of cars before. If you bump me or threaten my dog I will fall on the hood of your car. It will scare you and you will never ever get in another fender bender.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't want that to happen to you or anybody</p><p>Coming up hitting an American icon, Ford Motor caught in the middle as tensions between the U.S. and China intensify.</p><p>Then Tim Cook is pushing back, the Apple says Apple is not a monopoly is not a monopoly at all. Details coming up, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>U.S.-China trade tensions are heating up. China fining Ford's joint venture with China nearly $24 million for violating anti-monopoly law. This as trade talks between the U.S. and China remain at a stand still.</p><p>Joining me right now is Jonathan D.T. Ward, of Atlas Organization. He's the author of this book, \"China's Vision of Victory\". Jonathan -- it's good to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>JONATHAN D.T. WARD, ATLAS ORGANIZATION: Good to be here Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>So the vision of victory for of China is what?</p><p>WARD: The vision of victory for China is ultimately to surpass the United States, to use their economic power to build themselves into the dominant super power of the 21st century.</p><p>They're going to fill in the military and technological pieces but the bottom line is to use the power of 1.4 billion people to become a force unlike anything else in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there's really national security concerns around this. I mean that's one area that we've really been covering mostly -- the national security threat as opposed to just an economic story. Because this is way more than just a trade war.</p><p>Huawei is a perfect example. The Chinese technology company's chairman said that he's willing to sign a no spy deal with the United States. That's what he's saying. This as the U.S. is pushing a ban due to security concerns.</p><p>They recognize they're about to he see a ban, they are seeing a ban in the United States and they're about to see lots of partners, customers say we're no longer doing business with you because there is espionage going on. Everything that Huawei picks up goes right back to the Chinese government.</p><p>WARD: That's right. So you have to look at Huawei in the context of this entire system. And people are looking for a smoking gun, i.e., what have they done. The real smoking gun is the entire political system in China which says in its national intelligence law for example, any entity, company, organization must assist the Chinese state and national intelligence collection, must deny this. I mean you're talking about a man, the founder, engine say who wrote an ode to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation which is the Chinese Communist Party's goal of becoming the dominant super power.</p><p>So this is someone who is deeply embedded in that system.</p><p>BARTIROMO: so what do you do about this. I mean I feel like American companies have been so interested in getting their foothold into the Chinese economy to be able to sell to 1.4 billion people that along the way they forgot to protect their own products that the Chinese have been stealing their trade secrets, their knowhow and now the Chinese are at a point where yew, they can go head to head and compete with the U.S. right there and probably beat the U.S. in a number of ways.</p><p>WARD: Well, this is the problem is people weren't doing the long-term thinking on what it means to go into China. So all these, you know, two decades worth of tech transfer, JV's, or outright industrial espionage, this has consequences now.</p><p>China's share of the fortune global 500 has gone almost the same as the U.S. so the question now is, are companies prepared to compete with Chinese corporate as they go out often with the backing of the state and people are still looking at China's strategy as the China market, not the effect of China on all their global markets. This can be very disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll point this out. Out of the 30 largest banks, 13 are Chinese. The top five are Chinese. So the biggest banks in the world are Chinese.</p><p>The banking sector has had a tough time getting a real foothold in terms of owning 51 percent although UBS is, and now JP Morgan just got some waivers and licenses.</p><p>Senator Marco Rubio wrote a new \"Wall Street Journal\" op ed that you can't trust a Chinese audit. This is his point in the op ed. He's publishing for a new bill -- he's pushing for a few bill to ensure U.S. Listed companies comply with American financial reporting roles.</p><p>The Senator writes this, \"Many Chinese businesses are listed on the U.S. Stock Exchanges but Beijing's intra-signage ensures that American investors often don't get a true picture of those company's financial health.</p><p>I mean you look at a company like an Alibaba, where are the profits? They go through so many different areas so I think that's partly what he's referring to.</p><p>WARD: Sure. On one hand, the Chinese used this global system, I mean tomorrow is the anniversary of D-Day, of course, where you have really the beginning of America's global presence. The architects that came after that and set up an American order that lasted 70 years, I think that ended in 2014 when you had Crimea and the South China Sea happening at the same times.</p><p>Authoritarian nations which have come back, you know, and have used this system and you have Xi Jinping at Davos last year, you know, before talking about China as the free trader. These are not true. And so for them to use our system and then create their own advantages while having this ultimate goal of surpassing us is something that can't happen anymore. So we're going to have to work around that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, American companies have to go into China with their eyes wide open. I mean let's not forget today is the 3- year anniversary of Tiananmen Square where the Chinese government cracked down on protesters who wanted freedoms. And many people died, they were killed in this.</p><p>They're not going to know a thing about this in China because They will censor Google. They will censor all news so that No Chinese can actually read the facts of what happened. So American companies really need to have their eyes wide open going into operating with a company that's completely different approach than the U.S. democracy.</p><p>Do you think we're going to get a trade deal, bottom line?</p><p>WARD: I think in the end if you have something that's not going to amount to much. I mean you're talking about Xi Jinping lying to Barack Obama in the Rose Garden in 2015 about the South China Sea, you know, sunny lands about industrial espionage. I mean what you have don't change the nature of long-term U.S.-China competition. So the business community has got to be ready for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: so maybe we'll get a deal but it's not going to be a big deal because it's impossible to change cultures.</p><p>WARD: Not with -- it's not going to change what they want. It's not going to change their means of getting it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I couldn't agree more.</p><p>That's what I've been saying. How do you move the needle on something that's cultural, stealing IP, forcing the transfer of technology.</p><p>Jonathan -- congrats on the book. We'll be following your work. Thank you.</p><p>WARD: Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jonathan T.T. Ward joining us there on China.</p><p>Coming up reining-in big tech, Apple's CEO Tim Cook is hitting back on allegations of an Apple monopoly. We'll tell you what he says.</p><p>And then Microsoft's new venture. The tech company taking on men's grooming, details coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, June 5th. Your top stories right now, 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>We have breaking news this morning, we are remembering D-day. 75th anniversary commemorations currently underway in Portsmouth, United Kingdom. President Trump read a prayer earlier, originally read by President Franklin Roosevelt on the night of June 6th, 1944, after the Normandy invasion.</p><p>Countdown to tariffs on Mexico. Vice President Mike Pence will meet with Mexican officials today at the White House. Trying to make a deal before they go into effect in five days.</p><p>And a rate cut is now on the table officially. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said the central bank could take action if the trade battle escalates.</p><p>Markets are rallying on that comment on top of a huge rally yesterday. Take a look at Futures, indicating a gain at the start of trading of 135 points, one-half of one percent. The S&amp;P right now is up 14 points. And the NASDAQ up 45, two-thirds of a percent.</p><p>Next hour we will be getting the May ADP report, the expectation is for 180,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of May. This after a huge rally on Wall Street yesterday on Powell's comments. Take a look, the Dow Industrials up 512 points yesterday, better than two percent. The S&amp;P was up 58 points, also better than two percent. And the NASDAQ was up 194 points, that was 2.65 percent higher.</p><p>The momentum continues this morning in Europe. European indices are higher across the board. The FT-100 is up 33 points, half a percent. CAC Quarante in Paris is up 27 and the DAX Index in Germany is up 42.</p><p>In Asia overnight mixed story, although Japan was the best performer. The Nikkei average up 1.8 percent.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, targeting technology. The House Judiciary Committee gearing up for an anti-trust investigation into major technology companies promising a top to bottom review of the market power held by giant technology platforms. This as Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, is denying an Apple monopoly. Arguing that the company does not have a dominance share in any market.</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, it's a little unusual for the House Judiciary Committee to be shadowing the identical investigation that's being done by the Justice Department. And for the Justice Department to be shadowing the identical investigation that's being done by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>So, and it's also unusual for them to announce the existence of these investigations before anything happens. Now, the DOJ of course can sue, it can also indict. The FTC can change rules or adjudicate big tech folks as having violated rules and the House of Representatives can initiate legislation to change things.</p><p>Stated differently, they're all going after the tech giants because of the perception that they are too big and, therefore, need to be regulated. That perception I suggest to you is so contrary to free market principles and can only harm the consumer in the long run.</p><p>So, the without which there is nothing of anti-trust law, Emily knows this, is is there harm to the consumer. Tim Cook could have all the sharp elbows he wants and engage in all the price discrimination that he wants but if the consumer has not been harmed, there is no anti-trust case. So that's the bottom line.</p><p>When they did this with Microsoft, it took six years of investigation before a single document was filed in court. So I think we're going to be talking about this for a long time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you know if the consumer was harmed? Because doesn't Google right now represent 90 percent of all searches? I mean, they are obviously dominant.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes and it's the DOJ's job, if they're going to pursue Google -- let's say the DOJ decides and I don't think it will be this DOJ. Because this will take so long, assuming the president is reelected in 2020, this would not be resolved until after 2024, whatever DOJ it is. Their job to demonstrate to a judge, not a jury, the consumers had been harmed.</p><p>And they do this by economic experts using professors of economics who've done studies and will testify. Cases like this are usually very, very technical. On the technical side, how did Google get so big, how does it operate. On the economic side, who was harmed by it? Is there a trial? There is rarely a trial. These cases usually end in some sort of a settlement so the government can claim victory and the industry can claim.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you guys think? I mean, they're having hearings on June 11th. The Journal reported identifying five Senators and four Congressmen to watch as lawmakers focus on technology companies, Michael. They included Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer, Josh Hawley, along with Doug Collins and Ro Khanna. Doug Collins is our guest, coming up later on in the show.</p><p>BLOCK: This is grandstanding of the worst kind by both Congress and by this regulator who are trying to make names for themselves. They're the great crusaders out here. The fact that we're talking so much about, well, the DOJ gets this, the FTC gets that. We have a saying for that in finance. It's like you guys are arguing over who gets what percentage of nothing. That's what this comes down to.</p><p>But judge, I want to turn it back to like what this really means from a legal standpoint? What can the -- what can regulators do over a long period to actually remedy, say, Alphabet/Google's share (INAUDIBLE) of the search market? What would be a remedy there if they said, yes, these guys control the search market, it needs to be -- something needs to be done about this, it is hurting consumers, according to this judge. What can they do?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Google is such an efficient instrument for ascertaining information. The prosecutors themselves in the courtroom during the trial are going to be using Google. I mean, it's almost absurd that they would claim that it has to be broken up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't think it is -- Emily can get in here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Maria put her finger on it. What harm is there to the consumer?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can go through the harm to the consumer. But I'm curious -- since Emily is an attorney, I'm curious what she thinks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we should say this, there's more to this, it's not just the fact that they're so big. But the House Republicans are also wanting to know why they censor conservative conversation. That's another thing that the Republicans are looking at. Go ahead, Emily.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well judge, I just wanted to get your insight on, you know, much has been made over the Supreme Court allowing the lawsuit to proceed that Apple is setting the market prices out there, setting the inflation based on selling their app. So, can you speak to about us how that would dove tail in with these investigations on the merits?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That is a -- that's a very interesting case. That is a class action case, brought by people who claim, I bought an app from Apple for $99.00, I'm just going to use rounded numbers. Apple bought it for $0.99. What value did Apple add to it to justify the increase in price from $0.99 to $99.00.</p><p>Now, the old rule was forget it. You don't like it, go buy it from the person that sold it to Apple for $0.99. The new rule after the Supreme Court ruling is, wait a minute, you can't even find this guy who created it for $0.99. And he may have no assets and you had no financial relationship with him, therefore you can sue Apple. It sounds like it's a small deal. It's a huge deal because it's a class action. So who's in the class? Everybody who has an app from Apple. That's probably a quarter of the earth.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's the point. Here's how consumers get hurt. When Facebook basically abuses their private information and they lie to the users on Facebook about who has access to it. Facebook and Google combined control roughly two-thirds of all online advertising.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How are they using our data? Are they monetizing our personal information? You have a problem with the NSA, why wouldn't you have a problem with these two giants, this mono -- this duopoly in online advertising basically abusing our personal information and tracking our movements all over the internet and making money off of it and maybe over- charging the businesses who advertise on the internet?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I agree with you. But it is absurd for the federal government to go after somebody for violating privacy when the federal government is the biggest violator of privacy in the country. You know, but it well tell, they can't do it with a straight face.</p><p>Yes, you are right, they do violate privacy. I don't have to use them. But I can't avoid the NSA as long --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you can't avoid the internet. In this day and age, you could argue in a court of law that you can't avoid the internet. And if you are on the internet, they are abusing your information. These two companies, Facebook and Google.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, that's an area where they have violated my rights, your rights and the rights of everybody else's private information that makes its way into somebody else's hands.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But the government does it as well.</p><p>BLOCK: There needs to be no more Cambridge Analytica. But I'm not sure the death penalty are trying to baby out the bath water stance.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It wasn't Cambridge Analytica, it was -- this went on for years and years and years. And it was going on before Cambridge Analytica and Facebook had said that they had stopped the practice and it continued, of where they were accessing information of friends.</p><p>If you did -- if you did a poll, it was -- they had access not to the individual doing the poll but all of the data and interactions of their friends.</p><p>BLOCK: The regulators need to -- need to set up then an enforcement mechanism, healthy mechanism, there needs to be precedent set here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, I am -- I am a great defender of the Fourth Amendment but the Fourth Amendment which guarantees the right to be left alone only regulates the government. And I hate to say this, because I go through this with Varney all the time. What privacy is left? Is there even an expectation of privacy? There should be. We all expect some privacy. But it's dissipating right before our eyes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sure is. Judge, thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Coming up, keeping kids safe, Apple changing its app store to better protect children, it says.</p><p>And then Microsoft in men's grooming, the company's new Xbox venture, the sweet smelling details when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Earnings from Campbell's Soup now on the tape. Investors watching that. Cheryl Casone with the details in headlines right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: We're in some numbers, Maria. Good morning again. Campbell's Soup reporting adjusted profit of $0.56 a share that easily beat the estimate of $0.47. These are the third quarter numbers. The company raising full year earnings guidance by the way. But revenue of $2.18 billion missed the estimate for $2.36 billion. Let's take a look at the stock in the premarket. Well, there's the year-to-date. We'll watch that stock for you a little bit later.</p><p>American Eagle outfitters due to report its latest results at the top of the hour, same store sales expected to rise on increasing demand for its aerie line of lingerie. Again, a year-to-date chart of American Eagle on your screen.</p><p>Well, shares of GameStop sharply lower in the premarket this morning after the company's disappointing first quarter results. GameStop reported a 13 percent drop in the revenue. That did miss the estimate. The stock is down, look at that, almost 30 percent in the premarket, folks. They are halting their quarterly dividend we should add. GameStop's been struggling as it's facing major threats from tech giants like Google and Microsoft. Again, that stock down about 40 percent so far this year, and again, it is down in the premarket.</p><p>And then there is this, Xbox offering gamers a chance to clean up their act. Microsoft partnering with Unilever's Lynx for personal care products like Xbox body wash, Xbox deodorant. This is (INAUDIBLE) to report in game spot. The product line exclusive to Australia when it launches next month. There's a joke about showering and playing video games but I'm not going to go there. I'm just going to send it back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Apple's push for privacy, the company rolls out a new features to protect children, we've got those details right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Apple quietly making changes after its developer event on Monday. New app store guidelines focus on kids' apps. Joining us now the cyber guy, Kurt Knutsson in L.A. Kurt, good to see you this morning. Tell us what Apple is doing.</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBER GUY: Maria, always good to see you. Monday at the big Worldwide Developers Conference just up north of here in San Jose. First of all, thousands of people in attendance, the largest event I've seen so far attended and just after the event they dropped a hidden headline. And that is, that the guidelines for the app store are changing dramatically for app developers that intend to market to kids. Two big things coming out of this.</p><p>Number one, no longer will they be able to use third party ads to get to kids. And at the same time, they will not be allowed to use third party trackers. We've seen so much of this in the news more recently, even report it here about the Washington Post experiment where they found that 5,400 trackers were in one person's monthly use of their iPhone when they're not even using their iPhone, they're just simply sending information out. Kid's apps in the past have had trouble with this.</p><p>Curious World is one of them coming under fire for sending a child's name, their location, and a lot of other details straight to Facebook, incorporated. And at this point, Apple is saying if you violate these rules, we're really tightening up privacy, you are going to be kicked out of the app store.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Kurt, notwithstanding obviously the approval voiced at the Developers Conference, the question I have is whether there was any type of articulated sentiment of why did this take so long?</p><p>KNUTSSON: You know, you're not going to hear that in that audience. But you did hear a lot of sort of a relief sighed not on that, but when they talked about -- because they didn't talked about that at the -- at the conference.</p><p>What they did talk about is a very related theme and that is the sign-in to Apple feature that will be coming. And that is the ability to use Apple I.D. credentials to sign into other things that we use on a regular basis. The only ones really capitalizing that market is Google and Facebook. Those two going to see some huge competition here, because as Dagen points out, Facebook has just done a splendid job of proving to us that we cannot trust them with our privacy and at the same time, Apple is really embracing despite their occasional hit of the sort of lapses where how come this didn't happen already with regard to this kind of tightening of the app store. The number one rule there is revenue is why that didn't happen.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is, they're going to do well in this space. And that's going to be a big improvement for all of us, whether we're talking about our kids or whether we're just talking about our privacy in general, what's left of it, anyway.</p><p>BLOCK: Hi Kurt, any indication that say, Alphabet and Amazon are doing similar things in terms of -- you know, guidelines like this?</p><p>KNUTSSON: You know, they're typically responsive to Apple in this regard. I think what's going to be interesting is Apple like the sign-in feature as it relates to kids' apps being protected and us just being protected, you're going to see them tighten those rules in that fashion. We haven't heard it yet but at the same time, their credibility is just on a fine line, whether it'd be Alphabet, with Google or you're dealing with Amazon.</p><p>Amazon at the same time has become more and more focused on generating revenue from advertisements and not just being a retailer. So we've got our eye on them. But Apple at the same time never takes this information, their big proclamation that market is we're not using your personal data to benefit any other company except for you to interface with us. So, I think Apple is going to do well in the long term with this one.</p><p>I think in terms of personally, having covered technology for 20 years, I'm tossing out all the other credentials such as Facebook and Amazon that make it easy to sign on as soon as I have access to what appears to be a much more trusted source.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kurt, thank you. Good to see you.</p><p>KNUTSSON: Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kurt Knutsson, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, jobs in America. The ADP report out for the month of May in about 15 minutes. Next hour, we will have it, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: : Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, June 5th. Your top stories right now, just before 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, we are remembering D-day which is tomorrow.

In an interview with \"Vice News Tonight\" that aired Tuesday, Cook highlighted his company's commitment to user privacy, positioning Apple's business as one that stands apart from tech giants that compile massive amounts of personal data and sell the ability to target users through advertising. \"The narrative that some companies will try to get you to believe is: I've got to take all of our data to make my service better,\" he said. </p><p>\"Well, don't believe them. Whoever's telling you that, it's a bunch of bunk.\" Cook's remarks come at a pivotal time for Silicon Valley. In the past year, technology companies and their executives have come under unprecedented scrutiny from elected officials and regulators stemming from a variety of issues, including a barrage of data privacy scandals, accusations of toxic corporate culture, the negative impact of tech platforms on political debate, and concerns over tech overuse and addiction. In recent months, growing calls from Capitol Hill have boosted the prospects of new legislation aimed at big tech companies. Last week, Facebook disclosed that hackers stole information that could have allowed them to compromise over 50 million user accounts. The massive data breach was yet another blow to Facebook's reputation, as the company is still reeling from its Cambridge Analytica crisis, and from its role in a Russia-backed misinformation campaign designed to influence the 2016 presidential election. The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, called the breach \"deeply concerning\" and repeated his calls for Congress to pass new data privacy laws. Just days before the breach was announced, members of Congress questioned representatives from Google, Twitter and several telecom companies regarding user privacy. The companies were largely unwilling to commit to specific privacy rules and instead pledged to work with the Senate Commerce Committee on a comprehensive national privacy law. Cook said in the interview that he is \"exceedingly optimistic\" that the topic of data privacy has reached an elevated level of public debate. \"When the free market doesn't produce a result that's great for society you have to ask yourself what do we need to do. And I think some level of government regulation is important to come out on that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, urged consumers in a recent interview not to believe the dominant tech industry narrative that the data collected about them will lead to better services.

Whoever's telling you that, it's a bunch of bunk.\" </p><p>Cook's remarks come at a pivotal time for Silicon Valley. In the past year, technology companies and their executives have come under unprecedented scrutiny from elected officials and regulators stemming from a variety of issues, including a barrage of data privacy scandals, accusations of toxic corporate culture, the negative impact of tech platforms on political debate, and concerns over tech overuse and addiction. In recent months, growing calls from Capitol Hill have boosted the prospects of new legislation aimed at big tech companies.</p><p>Last week, Facebook disclosed that hackers stole information that could have allowed them to compromise over 50 million user accounts. The massive data breach was yet another blow to Facebook's reputation, as the company is still reeling from its Cambridge Analytica crisis, and from its role in a Russia-backed misinformation campaign designed to influence the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), called the breach \"deeply concerning\" and repeated his calls for Congress to pass new data privacy laws.</p><p>Just days before the breach was announced, members of Congress questioned representatives from Google, Twitter and several telecom companies regarding user privacy. The companies were largely unwilling to commit to specific privacy rules and instead pledged to work with the Senate Commerce Committee on a comprehensive national privacy law.</p><p>Cook said in the interview that he is \"exceedingly optimistic\" that the topic of data privacy has reached an elevated level of public debate. \"When the free market doesn't produce a result that's great for society you have to ask yourself what do we need to do.

And that is for regulators to decide, not for me to decide.' </p><p>Cook was being asked about Apple's competition, which in smartphones are Huawei and Samsung Electronics. </p><p>Its Macbook is struggling to gain market share in the personal computer sector and its Apple TV+ has recently been launched into a saturated video streaming market.</p><p>Cook said: 'We probably have more competitors than any company on earth.' </p><p>He also said the sector Apple had the biggest impact was in healthcare, as Apple Watches monitor the user's heart-rate.</p><p>Apple's dominance in the mobile phone market have considered many lawmakers to consider them to exert unfair influence, but with the rise of Samsung and Huawei in China, their market position has shrunk in recent years.</p><p>Investigations by the DOJ of the big tech platforms - Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc - are expected to be completed next year.</p><p>The move came as a growing number of lawmakers called for stricter regulation or even breaking up of the big tech companies, which have come under intense scrutiny following a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy.</p><p>Apple was also accused of anti-competitive behavior last month when the company announced new changes to its mobile phone operating system iOS 13, offering a host of new privacy and security features.</p><p>US lawmakers involved in the giant antitrust probe into Silicon Calley tech giants warned of their concerns that Apple is using privacy protection as a smokescreen for 'anti-competitive conduct'.</p><p>Before the announced changes, app developers could request background tracking permission from users, which is critical for apps that require location services to work, such as Bluetooth apps that help you find your keys like Tile and Trackr. </p><p>Critics point to the fact that these applications will essentially no longer be able to function as intended due to the proposed privacy changes. </p><p>However, Apple's own tracking features, which are notoriously difficult to opt out of, aren't affected by the change, leading to accusations Apple is trying to hinder third-party developers.</p><p>One specific accusation came from music-streaming service Spotify, which filed a legal complaint with the European Commission in March accusing Apple of anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>Spotify was unhappy with a 30 per cent fee that Apple charges on App Store subscriptions, arguing Spotify would have to raise its prices to account for the levy.</p><p>But Cook denied the company was a monopoly and added that their existence are not necessarily a bad thing. </p><p>Cook also said Apple was committed to boosting manufacturing in the US. </p><p>He added: 'We've created well over 2 million jobs in the US. The glass on this iPhone is made by Corning in Kentucky. Several of the semiconductors in the iPhone are made in the United States.</p><p>'There's enormous manufacturing happening in the US, just not the assembly of the final product.' </p><p>Earlier this week when disusing the DOJ probe, Attorney General William Barr cited his previous work for Verizon Communications, in arguing that big companies provided some benefits to consumers, particularly in telecommunications.</p><p>He said: 'Big is not bad. I think in certain network industries you can be too Balkanized and no one has the scale necessary for the kind of innovation that we're seeing.' </p><p>Apple spokesperson Trudy Muller claims the company is working with developers to address these concerns of seven app developers who wrote to Cook in August.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-58614258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR1-YWY1-JCJY-G1TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><timeReceived>12:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't seem to think that's the case, as evidenced by comments made in a recent interview.Axios on HBOIn a new interview withNikkei Asian Review[1], Cook touched on a range of familiar topics like privacy, manufacturing, and health. </p><p> When talking about antitrust and the fact that regulators are taking a stronger stance against big tech as a whole, however, Cook pushed back, saying that it is the responsibility of the company to not abuse its power. Apple, Cook stresses, sets itself apart from many of the companies under scrutiny because of its commitment to user privacy. 'A monopoly by itself isn't bad if it's not abused,' explained Cook. 'The question for those companies is, do they abuse it? And that is for regulators to decide, not for me to decideit's very important to realize that tech itself and these large tech companies are not monolithicyou're not our product, that's very clear in our minds. We don't believe in trafficking your data.' Cook went on to insist that Apple is not a monopoly, a notion he's repeated for the large part of his tenure as CEO, despite the Cupertino company having weathered numerous complaints of anti-competitive behavior from companies that compete with its services. Apple's App Store has been the subject of inquiries in countries around the world over whether it's a monopoly. Critics say that the App Store is fully controlled by Apple and only accessible on the company's platforms. Most importantly, in order to generate revenue off Apple's App Store, developers, some of which are Apple competitors, need to share the revenue with the tech giant. Spotify became the most recent example of one of these companies by filing a legal complaint with the European Commission in March. Cook's point clearly shows that there's at least some precedent for believing that not all monopolies are bad, even if there's a sense among some people that they are. Needless to say, Apple's monopoly problems aren't going away anytime soon. And Tim Cook's comments might not help to address that.

Apple has faced several complaints about how its App Store treats app providers who compete with Apple services. </p><p>This includes one by music streaming firm Spotify, which filed an antitrust complaint with European regulators in March. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] Apple CEO Tim Cook has defended the existence of monopolies in business, while also denying that Apple has a monopoly in any sector. In an interview with Nikkei Asian Review in Tokyo on Wednesday[2], during which Cook discussed a range of topics including Apple's treatment of competitors, he said: \"A monopoly by itself isn't bad if it's not abused.\" \"The question for those companies is, do they abuse it? And that is for regulators to decide, not for me to decide.\" Cook insisted Apple itself is not a monopoly - a line he has maintained for the duration of his tenure, despite Apple having faced multiple anti-competition complaints from app providers who compete with its services. In March, the music streaming service Spotify filed a legal complaint with the European Commission[3] over alleged anti-competitive practices.Spotify was unhappy with the 30% fee that Apple charges on App Store subscriptions, arguing that as Apple makes life extremely difficult for services that try and avoid that fee, Spotify would have to raise its prices to account for the levy. In turn, that would make Spotify more expensive than Apple's in-house streaming service, Apple Music, which doesn't have to pay the same 30% levy. Cook's reaction to the complaint[4] was to insist that \"no reasonable person\" would call Apple a monopoly. In Wednesday's Nikkei interview, Cook also denied that big tech firms are \"monolithic\" and attempted to distance Apple from fellow tech giants Facebook and Google, which have both been accused of accumulating consumer data to create near-monopolies. \"You're not our product, that's very clear in our minds. We don't believe in trafficking your data,\" he said.NOW WATCH: Apple just released iOS 13.2 with 60 new emoji and emoji variations.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p>We break it all down.  </p><p>Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p>The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p>In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p>In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p>Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p>But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p>But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p>And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p>And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p>Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p>Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p>And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p>And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p>And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p>So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p>So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p>So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p>Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p>And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p>So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p>Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p>But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p>Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p>I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p>And second of all -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p>I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p>But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p>And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p>LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p>LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p>LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p>LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p>They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p>But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p>I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p>CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p>And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p>So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p>LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p>But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p>LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p>And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p>But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p>CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p>These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p>Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p>LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.  These are some of the names I've  downgraded now.  </p><p>Their revenue forecast for the year because they're not expecting as many  orders coming from Apple, and this isn't first time that Apple's had  problems with launching a new handset.  </p><p>Remember, the iPhone 5c, do you remember?  The cheaper iPhone that they  launched five years ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  A month later, they also cut become on their orders as well because it  wasn't selling as well.</p><p>I think it's a -- it's a reality that there's saturation in the market.   People have the Apples and the handsets that they need.  </p><p>Can you keep selling 200 million plus each and every year?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then that separate chipmaker, the graphics chipmaker,  NVIDIA, it entered a bear market almost in one day.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Has -- it was down 19 percent.</p><p>LI:  But they've had that track record, up crash, up crash over the last  ten years.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They have.  </p><p>I want to move on to American and Chinese trade tensions boiling over at  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  </p><p>China reportedly upset of the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly  singling out their trade practices.</p><p>This was the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in  which the parties did not issue a communique.  James, your reaction to  this.</p><p>How much should we read into this issue?  Again, it made the front page of  \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Oh, boy.  \"Summit Breaks Amid Trade Tensions.\"</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p>So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p>LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p>I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>CARTER:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.  The final Florida  Election results are in.  Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p>She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p>Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  A public office is a public trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  That public trust now in the hands of Senator-elect Rick Scott.   He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p>\"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p>In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p>Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p>One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p>CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p>CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p>So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p>Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p>LI:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p>We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p>Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p>A full roundup, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p>A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p>Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p>Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p>Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p>The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p>So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p>President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p>But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p>Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p>JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.  It has to be you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald brought in  $16 million, but that makes it the lowest total ever for an opening weekend  in the Harry Potter franchise.  </p><p>These movies were spinoff of Harry Potter and it was filmed with 16 percent  below their 2016 opening weekend, the first version of this one.</p><p>Last week's box office winner, Doctor Seuss' The Grinch brought in just  over $38 million.  </p><p>And rounding up the top five, Bohemian Rhapsody, that's the Queen movie.   New release, Instant Family, and Widows rounding out your numbers, Dagen,  and those are your headlines.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p>Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p>He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p>There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p>And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p>And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p>Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p>ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p>So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p>Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p>I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p>And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p>I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p>And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p>So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p>Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p>The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p>So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p>Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p>But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p>I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p>And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p>The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p>Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p>Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p>With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p>And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p>And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p>I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p>We'll tell you more.  </p><p>And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p>Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p>More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p>In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p>Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p>From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p>We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p>Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p>RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p>And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p>And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p>No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p>Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p>And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p>But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p>Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p>But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p>I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p>I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p>CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p>And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p>And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p>And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p>I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p>LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p>MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p>You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p>Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p>MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.

Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Dagen.  King Salman bin Abdulaziz, is giving his first public  address since the killing of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi,  after embarking on a nationwide tour with his son, the Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman.  U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.  I know  exactly, I know everything that went on where that happened -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the crowned prince has continuously denied his involvement  in Khashoggi's murder.  </p><p>Well, General Electric reportedly facing a dilemma in Iraq, as the company  seeks power sales.  The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.  The report advises G.E. to distance himself  from at least one of its contracts there.  G.E. is competing with Germany's  Siemens for multi-billion-dollar new power contracts throughout that  country.  Shares of G.E. are lower in the pre-market, a quarter of a  percent right now.  </p><p>Well YouTube is now streaming full length movies for free.  But, of course,  there's a catch because nothing is free, right?  To enjoy them, you've got  to endure advertisements that support the movie.  But if you are willing to  pay to be a YouTube premium subscriber the ads go away.  Movies so far  include \"Rocky,\" \"Zookeeper,\" and \"Legally Blonde\" among other.  Shares of  Google parent company, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, up about one percent  so far this year, Dagen.  And there you go, another way to stream content.   Like number 50.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I hooked my dad with streaming his ACC games or his  University of Virginia games.</p><p>CASONE:  Nice, that's important.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a -- that was a long row, so to speak.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, the teaching moments with our parents can be interesting  sometimes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, dreams of Coach Condi; why  Condoleezza Rice says that she will not be coaching Cleveland Browns.  More  sports, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A lot of drama in NFL yesterday.  Jared Max is here with all of  your sports highlights.  Hey, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  There were  three walk off wins on last second field goals by the Broncos, the Cowboys  and the Raiders.  Last minute comeback went for the Steelers -- how about  the Vikings last night?  First place, Bears were up 14-0.  They were  leading 14-6 when Chicago's Eddy Jackson intercepted Kirk Cousins, brought  it in for a touchdown.  Chicago led 20-6, now, the bear were leading 25-20.   Two minutes to go, Minnesota after a touchdown tries an onside kick, but  the Bears recovering.  Chicago wins, now 7-3 way to off the NFC north.  </p><p>33 years to the day since legendary Washington Redskins Quarterback Joe  Theismann suffered a career-ending injury -- he was at the Skins' game  Sunday, where the team's current quarterback, Alex Smith suffered identical  injuries that Theismann did.  Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p>Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.   Though, she said she would like to get to call a couple of plates for  Browns, and open doors for women in coaching. </p><p>Watch this Formula 3 crash, at 171 miles per hour.  17-year-old German,  Sophia Floersch, fractured her spine, fractured a facial bone, suffered  concussion and other lacerations; 170 miles per hour at the Macau Grand  Prix in China.  She says, I'm fine but will go into surgery tomorrow.   NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series championship, Homestead, Miami, 12 laps to  go -- oh, well, this is actually before the race.  The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p>CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p>MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p>CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p>MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p>MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p>MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p>CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p>CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p>MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p>MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p>MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p>CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p>This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p>In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.  Stay tuned  to hear what the Apple chief had to say about the change coming to Silicon  Valley.</p><p>And a real life Santa Claus spreading holiday cheer at a Vermont Walmart.   That story later this hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, November 19th.  Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.  </p><p>Futures pointing to a lower open this morning.  78 point loss on the Dow  Futures right now, this after a week of red for the major market gauges.   The Dow and NASDAQ last week both falling more than two percent.  The S&amp;P  500 down more than 1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>In Europe we had a little bit of green in England and now the French  markets have turned to the plus side as well.  The DAX Index in Germany  still slightly lower to start this week.  </p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight, gains across the board there, the  biggest winner, the Shanghai up almost one percent.  </p><p>Facebook at war, why CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly has the company on red  alert.  What it could mean for the company's future and its stocks price.  </p><p>And leaving the crew, the CEO of J. Crew leaving the company, being in that  position for a little more than a year.  We have the details.  That was  Susan Li going hmm.  </p><p>Plus, 'tis the season, the White House preparing to celebrate for the  holidays and one mystery Santa makes some shoppers very happy at a Wal-Mart  in Vermont.  The heart-warming story ahead.  </p><p>And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a  splash with their own line of bath bombs.  You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".

Futures are down across the board, an  83-point loss on the Dow futures.  This after a down week for all three  market gauges.  The Dow and NASDAQ both falling more than two percent last  week. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 hurt a little less, but was off more than 1-1/2 percent.  In  Europe, we do have gains to report in England and in France at the moment.   The DAX Index down ever so slightly.  But it was a winning start to the  week in Asia, all four major markets there to the plus side.  This despite  rising trade tensions with China.  Vice President Mike Pence back from the  Asia-Pacific Summit without an accord.  Now, the focus shifts to next  week's G20 Summit where President Trump is set to meet with China's  President Xi Jinping. </p><p>Trouble for Nissan, reports say that Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been  arrested for alleged financial violations in Japan.  The automaker holding  a news conference shortly where it is expected to announce Carlos Ghosn's  removal as chairman.  Devastation in California, crews searching for  victims of the deadly Camp Fire that has left at least 77 dead and nearly  unaccounted for.  We will have a live report from the ground in California. </p><p>Plus, Theresa May standing firm, why the British Prime Minister says that  ousting her will not make the U.K. exit from the European Union any easier.   And it's a cool idea, one company is going the extra mile to make sure its  coats are good fit.  Here to break it all down with me this morning, Fox  Business Network's Susan Li, along with Wall Street Journal Assistant  Editorial Page Editor James Freeman, and pollster and President of  Maslansky + Partners Lee Carter. </p><p>I was trying to get Lee to give the bath bomb young women a free advice -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Happy to do it.  Happy to do  it.  Just a short segment. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I know on air, no.  I'm just kidding.  So much to discuss.   I can't wake to talk about trade, Apple, Facebook.  We much to explore in  the next hour.  But let's move on to trade tensions flaring between the  world's two biggest economies just ahead of talk between President Trump  and China Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit.  Edward Lawrence is live from the  White House with more.  Good morning, Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   The world is watching this trade dispute at a meeting over the weekend at  the Asian-Pacific Cooperation Summit.  The leaders could not come up with a  statement in part because of the Chinese and U.S. positions respectively.   Now, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended that conference along with Vice  President Mike Pence.  Now, the vice president will be here at the White  House later on today to brief the president on exactly what happened there. </p><p>Well, Chinese media now reporting that their vice premier will not come to  Washington, D.C. this week.  He was supposed to lay the groundwork with  treasury officials for that bilateral meeting with President Xi and  President Donald Trump in Buenos Aires later on this month.  That meeting  will now happen between the ministers after the presidential meeting on  December 1st.  Now, last week, the Chinese sent a list to the U.S. of what  they would like to see changed in order to have a trade agreement between  the two countries. </p><p>The president on Friday saying this was a long list and some things not a  good list.  But, again, he says it's a start.  Now, talking with Chris  Wallace over the weekend, he says, his tone is what's given him this  presidential wins and a good economy including on trade. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Because you have people  coming at you so hard that if you don't fight back in a somewhat vigorous  way, you're not going to win. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And as that talk at the president has $267 billion more of  Chinese goods that he could possibly put under tariffs.  On Friday, the  president saying he's going to hold off on that.  We'll see what happens  out of this meeting between he and President Xi, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Edward.  Edward Lawrence for us at the White House.   Joining us now is House Judiciary Committee member Texas Congressman Louie  Gohmert.  Congressman, your take on this and the state of trade in our  relationship with China. </p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  Well, I know a lot of people are upset  that, oh, it appears to be breaking down.  But I recall, the best  negotiating that Reagan ever did was when Gorbachev said get rid of the  missile defense and you can have everything else you want, and he got up  and left the table.  It was the best thing he ever did.  It led to a great  deal for us and eventually to the demise of the Soviet Union.  We're not  looking for the demise of China. </p><p>But I know there are some senators that say, we need to pass a bill that  get rid of the tariffs or the ability the president threatened tariffs.  He  is a deal maker and you know when it's about business, it's good to have a  businessman.  I was told years ago by a U.S. trade rep, Louie, you got to  understand that we know we have the biggest economy in the world, so when  we make a trade deal that's better for other countries than us, it really  inures to our benefit. </p><p>Well, garbage.  We -- if it's better for them, it's better for them and we  got a guy that knows how to negotiate and uses leverage in this case  tariffs. </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you that  over in the Pacific after this APEC Summit, my sources are saying that it's  all been shaken up because I guess Asian tradition goes with process,  procedure, and what they know best, right?  So with this president shaking  things up, it's, you know, some people are calling this a new front, a new  cold war that is taking place between the U.S. and China, your thoughts? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, it's been pretty cool for a long time because China has  been stealing our goods, stealing our technology, so the war was going on.   It was just a one-sided -- </p><p>LI:  Would you call it a cold war though, is that how you would  characterize the relationship? </p><p>GOHMERT:  It's a little bit if not -- it's freezing.  It's tepid.  It's  always been because China is not out to see the United States end up doing  well.  So only to the extent that they get paid back the money we owe them,  so, yes.  It's -- maybe not a cold war but a cool war.  But it's still  doesn't mean you can't negotiate.  But you got to use leverage and I'm  thankful we got a president knows how to make deals. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman maybe frosty would be a good work.  Continue. </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I'm wondering how long it stays  frosty.  You seem, congressman, optimistic that there is going to be a deal  here.  Do you foresee it in the immediate term here or do you think this  goes on for a while? </p><p>GOHMERT:  It's completely up to the Chinese.  I see that we will eventually  get a deal because the Chinese they're not stupid.  They know that when  there is a tariff war usually neither side of the tariff war wins.  But the  president should not have the leverage removed.  It, you know, every time  he brings up tariffs, he usually has the backdoors.  Now, if you work out a  trade deal with us then we'll be able to forget about the tariffs. </p><p>So I think we will get that worked out and it will be to the United States'  benefit instead of continuing to make another deal that hurts us -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, how quickly -- how quickly can -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know.  Just really -- how quickly can you get the U.S.- Mexico-Canada deal approved?  </p><p>GOHMERT:  Oh, I think it will be approved very quickly, yes.  That's going  to be good better for us than NAFTA.  Napa, NAFTA.  I've got Napa on the  brain.  I feel sorry for those folks.  They've been through it.  But, you  know, I think we'll get it approve very quickly.  I don't think it will be  that big of a problem. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to the border, hundreds of Tijuana residents  protesting the arrival of thousands of migrants yesterday attempting to  enter the United States.  This comes as border wall construction will soon  begin in Southern Texas.  Congressman Gohmert, you represent the people of  Texas, your thoughts on this.  Do you get more border wall funding in the  budget?  What do you say? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I've said each of the last two weeks, we were in session in  September that, you know, the Trump voters will come out in 2020.  They've  seen the president do all he could.  But they haven't seen us try to help  the president really at all, and we ought to put money in.  If we don't put  money in for the president to build a wall before the election, there's a  good chance we'll lose the majority.  Nobody listened.  We lose majority. </p><p>The least we can do is get money in there now and I know that we're working  on that I've talked to people that we have elected in leadership positions  that are trying to make sure we get something done to help the president  with the border wall.  The best thing we can do for the people of Mexico  and Central America is get a wall, built where we need it, secure the  border, cut off the hundreds of billions of dollars that have flowed for  drugs, for human trafficking, for sex trafficking because once we cut that  off then the corruption in Mexico comes to a crawl and it becomes one of  the top 10 economies in the world. </p><p>It should have already been if we had nipped the drug cartels, but we  haven't done that.  This president is going to do it for you. </p><p>LEE:  So, congressman, we know that immigration was one of the number one  issues to voters out there.  There's been a lot of criticism since the  election saying that Republicans used the caravan in a scare tactic to sort  of stoke that and make immigration more important and hope that they, you  know, would get into office and then they dropped it ever since.  How do  you respond to that now as the caravan is getting closer and we've got this  right in front of us? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I'm just grateful that, you know, alt-left and media like  CNN, MSNBC now realized, oh, there really are people.  It was not just an  election rouse.  These people have continued to come and they are a threat  to our sovereignty.  If we cannot enforce our borders then like Woodrow  Wilson did, when my least favorite president when he put 75,000 national  guard on the border after Pancho Villa came in and killed Americans.  I  mean this is something we've got to do. </p><p>There were seven -- over 70,000 Americans killed last year by the poison  that is being sold to us by the drug cartels.  This is important.  We got  to stop it.  We got to quit enriching the drug cartels and if we let these  folks in then there's just going to be wave after wave until we can kiss  the America we knew goodbye.  You have to have people that understand how  to keep a self-government and these folks don't know how to do that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Although Woodrow Wilson as a fellow Virginian, he's also behind  basically the arrival of the income tax in the United States, so that's  something to dislike about him as well. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Oh, he's my least favorite, yes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, thank you. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Thank you so much, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, no, I got one -- I'll move on to another topic,  Justice Department showdown President Trump addressing acting Attorney  General Matthew Whitaker's role and potentially limiting Special Counsel  Robert Mueller's probe during a Fox News interview yesterday.  Listen to  this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  It's going to be up to him.  I think he's very well aware  politically.  I think he's astute politically.  He's a very smart person.   A very respected person.  He's going do what's right.  I really believe  he's going to do what's right. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes  weighed in on what will happen to investigations over FISA abuse  allegations when the Democrats take over the House.  Here's what he told  Maria on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  We have three  buckets of information that we want declassified.  We now have a fourth  bucket that we want declassified.  The president has called for three of  those four to be declassified.  This begs an investigation by the  Department of Justice.  So either the Department of Justice under new  leadership can actually go in and investigate these cast of dirty cops is  really what they were and their connections to the Russians and their  connections to the Clinton campaign. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, your reaction to this and I just also want to point  out that John Roberts is reporting that the president will not be  submitting answers to Robert Mueller's team today, those written answers  they have been talked about, so your reaction to what you just heard. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I've worked with some of the folks on the Intel Committee  and they're doing all they can.  The president got some bad advice and  pulling back from declassifying all of the material that was being sought.   That stuff needs to come out.  It -- and he was told that it takes -- it's  a long slow process.  People that know told me we could get it done in an  hour if we're allowed to do that.  And so, we have got to get this stuff  out.  But as far as Matt Whitaker, I mean Matt is a great guy. </p><p>He's a great American.  He should have protected his boss better from those  that work for Rosenstein that have been undermining him.  I went over and  told Jeff who is undermining him and what they're doing and went over and  talked to Matt, and they -- he did not protect his boss.  And now, he's in  his boss' job.  But let me -- let me say this real quick, Dagen, you know,  you picked a jury.  You're not entitled to jurors that it never had an  opinion. </p><p>What you're entitled to is somebody that will be fair going forward and  making appropriate determinations.  They're not entitled to a brain-dead  acting attorney general and Matt is doing fine.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, good to see you.  Congressman Louie Gohmert, we'll  see you soon.  </p><p>GOHMERT:  Good to see you, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come up -- coming up, Florida recount chaos, the details as  Republican Governor Rick Scott wins the Senate seat in the Sunshine State.   More ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Republican Rick Scott officially defeating Democrat Bill Nelson  in the Florida Senate race.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Hey, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Took a while.  That's true,  Dagen.  Incumbent Bill Nelson conceding in the Senate race to Governor Rick  Scott after a hand recount. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D-FL), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious in  this race.  But I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  We may have been heavily outspent in this this campaign, but we  were never outworked.  To all Floridians, whether you voted for me or for  my opponent, or that you didn't vote at all, I ask you to never give up  this fight. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Scott issuing a statement saying, \"I just spoke with Senator  Bill Nelson who graciously conceded and I thanked him for his years of  public service.\"  Scott's win gets Florida two Republican Senators for the  first time in more than a century.  Meanwhile, Florida embattled Broward  County election official Brenda Snipes has reportedly resigned following  heavy criticism over her handling of vote in the midterm election. </p><p>Well, Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested.  The automaker making  the announcement at a news conference in Tokyo just moments ago.  The  company is going to propose ousting Ghosn at a board meeting that's being  held on Thursday after they uncovered significant acts of misconduct.   Japanese media say that Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo after meeting with  prosecutors on suspicion that he falsified his financial reports including  allegedly under reporting his income by millions. </p><p>Nissan also confirming that board member Greg Kelly is also under arrest  this morning.  Ghosn rescued Nissan from their bankruptcy starting back at  1999.  He's also the chairman and chief executive which I should say of  Nissan's partner Renault.  French President Emanuel Macron says that France  wants to ensure stability at the auto alliance and they will protect those  workers at Renault.  Shares of Nissan we should are down nearly 10 percent  so far this year. </p><p>Well, Canada Goose wants customers to put a thousand dollar parkas to the  test against the harshest of conditions, so much another adding get this  frigid rooms to some stores.  You can test the high-end coat in  temperatures as low as negative 13.  The rooms even come with a wind-chill  button.  This is very interesting new approach as part of the company's  plan to increasingly sell directly to consumers instead of relying on  wholesalers like they have done in the past. </p><p>I think it's a great idea, Dagen, and you know what you're dealing with  before you get out there and catch pneumonia because your coat is not warm  enough. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a great idea buying -- never mind. </p><p>CASONE:  One thousand dollar coat.  I -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is the fur thing.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- there are a lot of other things on the planet that can keep  you warm without fur.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, a path of  destruction.  We have live to California as officials say the deadly  wildfire isn't even halfway finished burning yet.  Plus, a tale of two  cities, why New York City's mayor is backing Amazon's decision to setup  shop in the Big Apply but not Wal-Mart, guess why?  I think you can.  More  on the story straight ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Futures are pointing to a lower open this morning.  But there  are also lows of the morning so far 44-point loss on the Dow futures right  now as investors watch negotiations with China.  We do have some retail  earnings coming out this week.  I think investors will be looking for any  sign that the holiday shopping season is going to be a strong one as we get  close to a Thanksgiving and the kind of unofficial start of the shopping  season.  James, your thoughts on where markets are right now? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So we're not seeing a huge dip maybe a lot of trade concern  priced and a lot of negative expectations about this negotiations priced  in, and if our friend, Mr. Scaramucci is right and Mr. Gohmert is right,  and you actually get a quick resolution of this that would suggest there's  a lot of room to run for these markets.  </p><p>LI:  But one of the main drags right now in the premarket is Apple once  again which dipped into correction territory.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting that even more suppliers (INAUDIBLE) reducing their outlook for  the year because they don't expect as many orders to come from Apple in the  future.  So I guess the markets are lacking leadership and there are  concerns about economic growth going into next year which Goldman Sachs  says will only grow in the one percent area. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I worry about any infrastructure spending bill that the  Democrats and Republicans try to get done together given where our debt and  our deficits are right now, and what that could do to interest rates  because if you're worried about interest rates here, you're going to be  biting your fingernails when the 10-year yield is at three and a half  percent -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- four percent. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Maybe in terms of if you're hoping for some pro-growth  legislation to come out next year, maybe there's an immigration deal where  you can allow more legal immigration.  I think that would be the only hope. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to the devastation in California.  A pair of  wildfires leaving at least 80 people dead, nearly 1,000 people are still  unaccounted for.  Jonathan Hunt has the latest in Malibu, California.   Jonathan? </p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, good morning to you.   The flames are no longer the issue either in and around the Camp Fire in  Northern California nor in the Woolsey Fire down here in Southern  California.  The fires are under control.  But the big concern now  particularly around the Camp Fire up in the north is the ongoing search for  bodies.  As you mentioned, there are still close to 1,000 people listed as  unaccounted for and teams have been going through what remains of the town  of Paradise desperately trying to search for any human remains that may  help them identify some of the missing. </p><p>It's a race against time because rain is coming in the next 24 to 36 hours.   And when you're talking about properties that have been burned to tiny  pieces of ash finding human remains is difficult enough.  If the rains come  in and wash a lot of those ashes away, it will become even more difficult.   Meantime though, there was a vigil held near Paradise, California for those  who survived the deadly fires.  That was held last night.  A lot of people  showing up simply because they wanted to be in the presence of other  survivors.  Listen here. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARRIE LYNN, PARADISE RESIDENT:  I just know that God is comforting us as  far as imagine and we're living in.  It's really -- and then I look around  at all the kindness. </p><p>JOE FLORENCE, PARADISE RESIDENT:  My wife is -- she needs some closure.  To  be around other people that have gone through the same thing that we have,  it helps with the grieving process. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HUNT:  Here in Southern California, in Malibu in particular, many residents  are being allowed back in.  Although, a lot of them are finding this.  You  can see behind me that they have pretty much nothing left.  Also concerns  about rain coming here this week.  Dagen, you can't see to my right in this  dark, but we're beneath the Santa Monica Mountains.  When you get these  fires, it burns away all the brush, all the trees.  That essentially means  there's no anchors for the topsoil on there. </p><p>You get the rains.  We get mudslides.  We saw it last year after the big  fires in Santa Barbara followed by deadly mudslides.  That is now the fear  here in Malibu, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jonathan, thank you for all your reporting.  Jonathan Hunt in  Malibu for us.  </p><p>HUNT:  Sure. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, battle over Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May now  issuing a stark warning to opponents threatening to unseat her.  Former  foreign policy adviser former under Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is  weighing in on those negotiations.  That is next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo, it's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure to start this shortened holiday week, Futures lower across  the board; 52-point loss on the Dow Futures right now after a losing week  for all three major market gauges last week.  In Europe, some mixed market  action we have right now, all of the markets there are up but FTSE and the  CAC in France have been toggling back-and-forth between negative and  positive, but green across the board right now.  </p><p>This as British Prime Minister Theresa May assures Britain that ousting her  will not make Britain's exit from the European Union any easier.  And then  we move on to protests in France, the newest problem facing President  Emmanuel Macron that has the French taking to the streets.  Asian markets  finishing higher overnight; gains across the board on all four major  markets there.</p><p>Facebook, under more fire.  First details on why CEO Mark Zuckerberg  reportedly has the company on red alert, then a report on why cutting back  on the social media site is good for your mental health.  And then,  Amazon's big move from super secrecy during the headquartered two selection  process to hot shots from \"Saturday Night Live\" over weekend.  That and  more, the latest from the online retailer. </p><p>To our top story this half-hour.  Moving the plan forward, British Prime  Minister Theresa May is selling agreement for great Britain's exit from the  European Union.  The British leader citing her deal's tough measures on  immigration is one of its strengths; May re-enforcing her resolve to see  this through to the end earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  My job is to get the best deal.   Parliament must then examine it and do what is in national interest.  We  have in view a deal that will work for the U.K. and let no one be in any  doubt, I am determined to deliver it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here now, Director of the Thatcher Center for Freedom at the  Heritage Foundation, Nile Gardiner.  Now, your reaction to Theresa May's  comments and her handling of the Brexit.  </p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF THE THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM AT THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Well, good morning.  I have to say that Theresa May's handling  of the Brexit negotiations have been absolutely disastrous.  In effect,  it's really been a surrender to the European Union.  And the proposal that  she has put forward is completely unacceptable.  It, basically, makes  Britain subservient to the European Union; it does not take Britain outside  of the E.U. Customs Union, the U.K. will not able to sign free trade  agreements including with the United States.  So, this is a deal that does  not restore British sovereignty and self-determination and freedom to the  British people.  </p><p>So, Theresa May, I think, has not lived up to the promises she made to the  British people earlier.  And in many ways, and this is an appalling weak- kneed deal offered by the British prime minister, which is being heavily  opposed by a large number of MPs within her party and she's faced a wave of  resignations, there'll be more resignations to come.  She could indeed face  a vote of \"no\" confidence later this week, if enough conservative MPs come  forward to call for such a vote.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Nile, James Freeman here with the Wall Street Journal.  It sounds  like you're more in camp of wanting what we call hard Brexit, do you feel  like there would be an opportunity for the U.K. out of the E.U. to do a  trade deal, perhaps join our new NAFTA-USMCA, perhaps other moves.  Can you  give us your forecast for if Britain leaves the E.U. completely?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, Brexit definitely taking place on March 29, 2019.  It's a  matter of what kind of Brexit it is.  And the British people in 2016 voted  in huge number: 17.4 million Britons voted to leave the European Union;  they understood that they were leaving the single market and customs union  when they voted.  That was the key message from the voted leave campaign,  the official campaign to vote to leave the European Union.  </p><p>And so, the British people want to see their sovereignty restored.  Theresa  May's deal does not deliver that; it's far better, I think, for Britain to  -- either renegotiate this new May proposal or seek a \"no\" deal Brexit  where Britain trades with the rest of the world under WTO terms also trades  with E.U. under WTO terms.  It would be far preferable, I think, to what  Theresa May is offering which is a deal that shackles Britain indefinitely  to the European Union, that's not what British people voted for.  </p><p>CARTER:  Is there anyone -- I'm curious, because it was so divided when  Brexit was voted on and there were so many people who wanted to say, is  there anyone right now who looks at this deal and says, I'm happy that  we're not doing a hard exit -- is there any of the constituents here who  said this is, this is what we should be doing?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, certainly there are, you know, some supporters of Theresa  May within the conservative party.  There are also, I think, big business  interests who have backed the Theresa May proposal.  There are also many  business leaders who oppose this deal as well.  So, certainly, there has  been a mixed reaction to this, but if you look at the public opinion polls,  there is less than 20 percent support for the Theresa May deal right now.   It's deeply unpopular.  There's a lack of trust in the prime minister and  she's no Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May, that's for sure.  </p><p>Margaret Thatcher would've negotiated a tough deal in the British national  interests.  In addition, Theresa May has pledged to hand over 39 billion  pounds to European Union for nothing in return.  I think the, you know, the  British have been treated with utter, you know, disdain and contempt by  European Union, and this is a sheer blackmail from the E.U. here and should  not give in to these demands.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So, it sounds like you're not a Theresa May fan, is  that fair to characterize you that way?  Does she need to go?  </p><p>GARDINER:  I have to say, she's been hugely disappointing and I think if  she faces a vote of \"no\" confidence, there's a very good chance, I think,  that we could see a new prime minister by the end of this year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move across the channel to France.  Protests erupting  over increased taxes on fuel, now what do these protests say about the  popularity of Macron's presidency?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Uh, well, I think -- you know, Emmanuel Macron's presidency has  been nothing short of disastrous, really.  He has an opinion poll rating at  around, sort of, 21 percentage points which is not exactly a vote of  confidence from the French people.  I think that Emmanuel Macron is seen as  deeply out of touch, as arrogant, as someone who doesn't understand the  concerns of ordinary French voters.  He's a politician, I think, he was  full of, sort of, you know, grand visionary ideas, that cannot understand,  you know, why his own voters don't -- you know, don't support him anymore.  </p><p>And this latest fuel tax which hits tens of millions of French drivers is  deeply unpopular, that's fueling the protests, but Emmanuel Macron, I  think, as somebody who really lives in a sort of another, you know,  political dimension, who dreams of creating a grand European Union Army  while his own people around from the streets protesting against his  leadership, so I think there's a lot of delusional thinking, actually, in  the Elysee Palace these days under Emmanuel Macron.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nile, this is a conversation I had over the weekend with  someone, that the socialists, the kind of new born American socialist that  we hear from quite often, they kind of preach that if we just tax the one  percent more, we can pay for all of these lovely things that Americans  need, but that is not what goes on in other nations, say, across Europe.   The people of these nations -- and I look at France, are taxed to their  teeth, in the form of gas taxes, you name -- value-added taxes.  It's not  just the one percent that's paying for if everything.  </p><p>And in fact, in this country, if you confiscated every single dollar that  the top one percent earned in adjusted growth income, it wouldn't be enough  money to pay for Medicare for all, it' would be two trillion versus 3.2.  trillion.  You would have to confiscate every dollar of adjusted growth  income from the top five percent and that would only pay for Medicare for  all and these protests kind of speak to that. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes, I think, you know, French people have had enough of, you  know, huge state taxes and, you know, France has been basically, sort of, a  big government, sort of, economic you know, basket case for successive  decades thanks to, you know, to high tax policies.  You know, hundreds of  thousands of French citizens have fled to London over the past decade  seeking jobs and opportunities in lower taxes, actually and so you've got  economic refugees leaving France heading to -- especially to the U.K. where  there's a lower tax regime and more free market policies.  </p><p>And basically, I think, increasing Europeans are rejecting socialist style  government -- and at the end of the day, Emmanuel Macron is a big  government thinker, he talks about, you know, free trade, he talks about  free markets.  But in reality, you know, France remains whetted to very  high levels of taxation, it has high levels of unemployment; Emmanuel  Macron is at heart a protectionist he's someone who calls Brexit a crime.   You know, this is a leader who, I think, is just deeply out of touch with,  you know, his own -- you know, his own people and I think is the reflection  of the huge economic problems that you see across big government high tax  European Union today.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, he -- obviously, Macron came into office promising the  opposite: A more dynamic economy.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  A more open economy in France, I guess it hasn't happened,  exactly.  </p><p>GARDINER:  That is not that -- that is not materialized at all.  And in  fact, I think, you know, Emmanuel Macron's big priority right now is a  creation of some sort of grand European Union super state.  So, he is  leader of the Euro Federalist in Europe and its latest plan calls to build  a European Union Army which he calls -- calls for to challenge the United  States.  And so, this is the mindset of the, of the French president right  now, completely delusional and out of touch with reality altogether.  And  so, it's hard to see how Emmanuel Macron is going to be re-elected in 2022  at this rate.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What are they using baguettes as spears and power of taxation to  frighten everyone?  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  Thank you so much, sir.   Great to see you, Nile Gardiner.</p><p>GARDINER:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.  Facebook fallout Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney  that is, will weigh in on how the Web site can make people depressed.   \"Saturday Night Live\" poking fun at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVE CARELL, ACTOR:  Hi everyone, as you know, Amazon just announced  location of its two new headquarters in New York and Virginia.  And  everyone, except for the people who live there and people who live in all  the places we didn't choose, is thrilled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More of Steve Carell.  We have to say thank you to Susan Li,  you'll catch her at the New York Stock Exchange all day.  She's working  hard, stay with us, Varney straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More fallout for Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg under fire over  his reactions to damaging reports about the company.  And now, a new study  also shows it can make you depressed.  Joining me now is the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  OK.  Actually, there is a new  study.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And it is objective.  It's from the University of Pennsylvania.   Now, this has got nothing to do with Facebook's data breaches or their, you  know, censorship of conservative opinion, this is something completely  separate.  This is getting used to this new thing, social networks.  Well,  the University of Pennsylvania studied I think 140, 150 undergraduates at  the college, and for some of them, half of them, they took away their  social network usage.  Then just limited to 10 minutes a day, that half of  the study, their mood all improved.  No more depression, no more, what --  less depression, less anxiety.  The other group which stayed with social  networks hours and hours and hours a day, no improvement in mood  whatsoever.  Apparently, this is the first cause and effect study that's  being recognized as Facebook can give you depression.</p><p>Now, this occur -- it occurs to me that, you know, younger person, you're  on Facebook, and you're scrolling through other people's lives, and all the  people's lives on Facebook are always wonderful, great boyfriend, great  girlfriend, fabulous family, new job, new house, wonderful vacation on the  beach, you got it all.  But what about you?  You look bad in comparison to  all of your friends and relatives who are looking so good on Facebook.  So  you get depressed because you're not enjoying life like they are.  And it's  a way -- we have to get used to this thing, it's not going to go away.   But, we have to get used to how to use it, and I don't think we're there  yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I stopped using Facebook, and even before that, Stuart, I lied  about virtually every bit of information I ever gave them.  I am actually  25 years of age according to Facebook whereabouts.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, and I'm 39.  You know, that's life, but I -- actually, I  don't use Facebook.  I don't do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You have other -- you're out cutting brush and doing things  outdoors, so I can't imagine you ever having time to like scroll through  recipes for ooey gooey butter cake on Facebook.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're absolutely right there, Dagen.  And no contest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just do not see that being your bag, Mr. Varney.</p><p>VARNEY:  Not me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not at all.  But doing T.V. is, and Stuart is coming up in about  10 minutes' time every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Stuart  Varney 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Thank you, Stuart, great to see you, my friend.</p><p>Coming up, a tale two of cities, why New York City's Mayor is backing  Amazon's decision to set up shop in the Big Apple, and the hand-outs and  perks Amazon got.  But no Wal-Mart.  Guess why, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Headquarter headache, Amazon facing fallout over its big move to  New York City from people all over the political spectrum.  Lauren  Simonetti has the latest.  Hey, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Dagen, didn't you  know that some big businesses are good and others are bad?  Well, at least  that's the rationale merging from New York City's winning bid for Amazon's  second headquarters or part of it.  Mayor Bill de Blasio bring up his  efforts to keep Wal-Mart out in response while on a local radio program on  Friday.  This is what he said, \"I was actively involved in the effort to  keep Wal-Mart out of New York City.  Wal-Mart is an entirely different  universe in terms of the systematic efforts they've taken to undermine  labor, small business, the environment, American workers, and obviously,  the politics of the Walton family.  Wal-Mart does not belong in New York  City.\"</p><p>Yes, he's rolling out the red carpet for Amazon, though, which also doesn't  support unions, which also kills off mom and pops, and hasn't put his money  where CEO Jeff Bezos' politics are or at least where the politics of his  newspaper at The Washington Post are.  Whereas this was interesting, I did  some research on this, Wal-Mart's Walton family has given money to  democratic politicians in the past including the Governor of New York  Andrew Cuomo.  But let's get back to basics, he was played by Steve Carell,  must-see T.V.  This was \"Saturday Night Live\" watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARELL:  Some folks have speculated that I was somehow trolling President  Trump by building one headquarters in his hometown of Queens, and the other  in his current residence of Washington D.C., thereby overshadowing or  humiliating them, but that's simply not true.  Sure, he attacked me  repeatedly on Twitter, but I chose our new locations because they were  ideal for growing business, not just to make Donald Trump think about how  I'm literally 100 times richer that he is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It was awesome.  I love the part where they put up all the  Twitter attacks.  You know, the SNL writers only knew the dog codenames  that he -- that the company gave for the 20 finalists competing for the  second quarters.  Crystal City, Virginia or Arlington (INAUDIBLE) New York  (INAUDIBLE) so the Amazon is very dog-friendly.  They basically gave each  of the cities a dog name for their codename.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But by -- can we go back to the de Blasio thing.  Because you  don't like -- you don't actually like the perks, the tax perks that New  York City got, but in terms of the politics, no company helps lower-income  Americans more than a Wal-Mart, and giving people easy access to very  inexpensive goods and groceries, so they are on par with Amazon.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, thank God -- thank goodness Mr. de Blasio is not running the  country.  This idea that I'm going to treat businesses differently because  I don't like the politics of their owners, this is -- this is the New York  Model, it's keep taxes very high, and no businesses would want to come  here, so then decide particular businesses that you like to give big  incentives to.  There, just lower rates for everybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mayor Pothole will never be President Pothole.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lauren Simonetti, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Freeman, Carter, thank you.</p><p>CARTER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's all about Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney.  Take it away, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, thank you so much.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p>We break it all down.  </p><p>Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p>The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p>In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p>In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p>Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p>But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p>But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p>And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p>And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p>Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p>Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p>And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p>And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p>And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p>So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p>So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p>So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p>Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p>And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p>So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p>Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p>But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p>Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p>I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p>And second of all -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p>I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p>But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p>And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p>LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p>LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p>LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p>LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p>They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p>But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p>I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p>CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p>And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p>So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p>LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p>But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p>LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p>And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p>But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p>CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p>These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p>Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p>LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.  These are some of the names I've  downgraded now.  </p><p>Their revenue forecast for the year because they're not expecting as many  orders coming from Apple, and this isn't first time that Apple's had  problems with launching a new handset.  </p><p>Remember, the iPhone 5c, do you remember?  The cheaper iPhone that they  launched five years ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  A month later, they also cut become on their orders as well because it  wasn't selling as well.</p><p>I think it's a -- it's a reality that there's saturation in the market.   People have the Apples and the handsets that they need.  </p><p>Can you keep selling 200 million plus each and every year?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then that separate chipmaker, the graphics chipmaker,  NVIDIA, it entered a bear market almost in one day.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Has -- it was down 19 percent.</p><p>LI:  But they've had that track record, up crash, up crash over the last  ten years.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They have.  </p><p>I want to move on to American and Chinese trade tensions boiling over at  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  </p><p>China reportedly upset of the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly  singling out their trade practices.</p><p>This was the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in  which the parties did not issue a communique.  James, your reaction to  this.</p><p>How much should we read into this issue?  Again, it made the front page of  \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Oh, boy.  \"Summit Breaks Amid Trade Tensions.\"</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p>So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p>LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p>I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>CARTER:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.  The final Florida  Election results are in.  Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p>She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p>Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  A public office is a public trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  That public trust now in the hands of Senator-elect Rick Scott.   He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p>\"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p>In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p>Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p>One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p>CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p>CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p>So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p>Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p>LI:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p>We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p>Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p>A full roundup, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p>A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p>Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p>Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p>Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p>The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p>So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p>President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p>But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p>Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p>JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.  It has to be you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald brought in  $16 million, but that makes it the lowest total ever for an opening weekend  in the Harry Potter franchise.  </p><p>These movies were spinoff of Harry Potter and it was filmed with 16 percent  below their 2016 opening weekend, the first version of this one.</p><p>Last week's box office winner, Doctor Seuss' The Grinch brought in just  over $38 million.  </p><p>And rounding up the top five, Bohemian Rhapsody, that's the Queen movie.   New release, Instant Family, and Widows rounding out your numbers, Dagen,  and those are your headlines.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p>Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p>He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p>There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p>And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p>And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p>Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p>ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p>So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p>Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p>I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p>And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p>I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p>And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p>So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p>Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p>The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p>So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p>Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p>But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p>I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p>And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p>The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p>Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p>Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p>With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p>And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p>And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p>I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p>We'll tell you more.  </p><p>And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p>Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p>More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p>In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p>Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p>From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p>We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p>Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p>RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p>And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p>And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p>No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p>Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p>And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p>But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p>Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p>But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p>I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p>I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p>CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p>And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p>And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p>And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p>I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p>LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p>MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p>You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p>Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p>MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.

King Salman bin Abdulaziz, is giving his first public  address since the killing of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi,  after embarking on a nationwide tour with his son, the Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman.  U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.  I know  exactly, I know everything that went on where that happened -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the crowned prince has continuously denied his involvement  in Khashoggi's murder.  </p><p>Well, General Electric reportedly facing a dilemma in Iraq, as the company  seeks power sales.  The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.  The report advises G.E. to distance himself  from at least one of its contracts there.  G.E. is competing with Germany's  Siemens for multi-billion-dollar new power contracts throughout that  country.  Shares of G.E. are lower in the pre-market, a quarter of a  percent right now.  </p><p>Well YouTube is now streaming full length movies for free.  But, of course,  there's a catch because nothing is free, right?  To enjoy them, you've got  to endure advertisements that support the movie.  But if you are willing to  pay to be a YouTube premium subscriber the ads go away.  Movies so far  include \"Rocky,\" \"Zookeeper,\" and \"Legally Blonde\" among other.  Shares of  Google parent company, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, up about one percent  so far this year, Dagen.  And there you go, another way to stream content.

Hey, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  There were  three walk off wins on last second field goals by the Broncos, the Cowboys  and the Raiders.  Last minute comeback went for the Steelers -- how about  the Vikings last night?  First place, Bears were up 14-0.  They were  leading 14-6 when Chicago's Eddy Jackson intercepted Kirk Cousins, brought  it in for a touchdown.  Chicago led 20-6, now, the bear were leading 25-20.   Two minutes to go, Minnesota after a touchdown tries an onside kick, but  the Bears recovering.  Chicago wins, now 7-3 way to off the NFC north.  </p><p>33 years to the day since legendary Washington Redskins Quarterback Joe  Theismann suffered a career-ending injury -- he was at the Skins' game  Sunday, where the team's current quarterback, Alex Smith suffered identical  injuries that Theismann did.  Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p>Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.

The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p>CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p>MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p>CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p>MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p>MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p>MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p>CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p>CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p>MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p>MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p>MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p>CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p>This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p>In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p>Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.  </p><p>Futures pointing to a lower open this morning.  78 point loss on the Dow  Futures right now, this after a week of red for the major market gauges.

The heart-warming story ahead.  </p><p>And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a  splash with their own line of bath bombs.  You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Thank you so much for having us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing  new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on \"SNL\".   We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, November 19th, Happy  Thanksgiving, a little early.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern,  markets under pressure this morning.  Futures are down across the board, an  83-point loss on the Dow futures.  This after a down week for all three  market gauges.  The Dow and NASDAQ both falling more than two percent last  week. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 hurt a little less, but was off more than 1-1/2 percent.  In  Europe, we do have gains to report in England and in France at the moment.   The DAX Index down ever so slightly.  But it was a winning start to the  week in Asia, all four major markets there to the plus side.  This despite  rising trade tensions with China.  Vice President Mike Pence back from the  Asia-Pacific Summit without an accord.  Now, the focus shifts to next  week's G20 Summit where President Trump is set to meet with China's  President Xi Jinping. </p><p>Trouble for Nissan, reports say that Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been  arrested for alleged financial violations in Japan.  The automaker holding  a news conference shortly where it is expected to announce Carlos Ghosn's  removal as chairman.  Devastation in California, crews searching for  victims of the deadly Camp Fire that has left at least 77 dead and nearly  unaccounted for.  We will have a live report from the ground in California. </p><p>Plus, Theresa May standing firm, why the British Prime Minister says that  ousting her will not make the U.K. exit from the European Union any easier.   And it's a cool idea, one company is going the extra mile to make sure its  coats are good fit.  Here to break it all down with me this morning, Fox  Business Network's Susan Li, along with Wall Street Journal Assistant  Editorial Page Editor James Freeman, and pollster and President of  Maslansky + Partners Lee Carter. </p><p>I was trying to get Lee to give the bath bomb young women a free advice -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Happy to do it.  Happy to do  it.  Just a short segment. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I know on air, no.  I'm just kidding.  So much to discuss.   I can't wake to talk about trade, Apple, Facebook.  We much to explore in  the next hour.  But let's move on to trade tensions flaring between the  world's two biggest economies just ahead of talk between President Trump  and China Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit.  Edward Lawrence is live from the  White House with more.  Good morning, Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   The world is watching this trade dispute at a meeting over the weekend at  the Asian-Pacific Cooperation Summit.  The leaders could not come up with a  statement in part because of the Chinese and U.S. positions respectively.   Now, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended that conference along with Vice  President Mike Pence.  Now, the vice president will be here at the White  House later on today to brief the president on exactly what happened there. </p><p>Well, Chinese media now reporting that their vice premier will not come to  Washington, D.C. this week.  He was supposed to lay the groundwork with  treasury officials for that bilateral meeting with President Xi and  President Donald Trump in Buenos Aires later on this month.  That meeting  will now happen between the ministers after the presidential meeting on  December 1st.  Now, last week, the Chinese sent a list to the U.S. of what  they would like to see changed in order to have a trade agreement between  the two countries. </p><p>The president on Friday saying this was a long list and some things not a  good list.  But, again, he says it's a start.  Now, talking with Chris  Wallace over the weekend, he says, his tone is what's given him this  presidential wins and a good economy including on trade. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Because you have people  coming at you so hard that if you don't fight back in a somewhat vigorous  way, you're not going to win. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And as that talk at the president has $267 billion more of  Chinese goods that he could possibly put under tariffs.  On Friday, the  president saying he's going to hold off on that.  We'll see what happens  out of this meeting between he and President Xi, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Edward.  Edward Lawrence for us at the White House.   Joining us now is House Judiciary Committee member Texas Congressman Louie  Gohmert.  Congressman, your take on this and the state of trade in our  relationship with China. </p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  Well, I know a lot of people are upset  that, oh, it appears to be breaking down.  But I recall, the best  negotiating that Reagan ever did was when Gorbachev said get rid of the  missile defense and you can have everything else you want, and he got up  and left the table.  It was the best thing he ever did.  It led to a great  deal for us and eventually to the demise of the Soviet Union.  We're not  looking for the demise of China. </p><p>But I know there are some senators that say, we need to pass a bill that  get rid of the tariffs or the ability the president threatened tariffs.  He  is a deal maker and you know when it's about business, it's good to have a  businessman.  I was told years ago by a U.S. trade rep, Louie, you got to  understand that we know we have the biggest economy in the world, so when  we make a trade deal that's better for other countries than us, it really  inures to our benefit. </p><p>Well, garbage.  We -- if it's better for them, it's better for them and we  got a guy that knows how to negotiate and uses leverage in this case  tariffs. </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you that  over in the Pacific after this APEC Summit, my sources are saying that it's  all been shaken up because I guess Asian tradition goes with process,  procedure, and what they know best, right?  So with this president shaking  things up, it's, you know, some people are calling this a new front, a new  cold war that is taking place between the U.S. and China, your thoughts? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, it's been pretty cool for a long time because China has  been stealing our goods, stealing our technology, so the war was going on.   It was just a one-sided -- </p><p>LI:  Would you call it a cold war though, is that how you would  characterize the relationship? </p><p>GOHMERT:  It's a little bit if not -- it's freezing.  It's tepid.  It's  always been because China is not out to see the United States end up doing  well.  So only to the extent that they get paid back the money we owe them,  so, yes.  It's -- maybe not a cold war but a cool war.  But it's still  doesn't mean you can't negotiate.  But you got to use leverage and I'm  thankful we got a president knows how to make deals. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman maybe frosty would be a good work.  Continue. </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I'm wondering how long it stays  frosty.  You seem, congressman, optimistic that there is going to be a deal  here.  Do you foresee it in the immediate term here or do you think this  goes on for a while? </p><p>GOHMERT:  It's completely up to the Chinese.  I see that we will eventually  get a deal because the Chinese they're not stupid.  They know that when  there is a tariff war usually neither side of the tariff war wins.  But the  president should not have the leverage removed.  It, you know, every time  he brings up tariffs, he usually has the backdoors.  Now, if you work out a  trade deal with us then we'll be able to forget about the tariffs. </p><p>So I think we will get that worked out and it will be to the United States'  benefit instead of continuing to make another deal that hurts us -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, how quickly -- how quickly can -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know.  Just really -- how quickly can you get the U.S.- Mexico-Canada deal approved?  </p><p>GOHMERT:  Oh, I think it will be approved very quickly, yes.  That's going  to be good better for us than NAFTA.  Napa, NAFTA.  I've got Napa on the  brain.  I feel sorry for those folks.  They've been through it.  But, you  know, I think we'll get it approve very quickly.  I don't think it will be  that big of a problem. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to the border, hundreds of Tijuana residents  protesting the arrival of thousands of migrants yesterday attempting to  enter the United States.  This comes as border wall construction will soon  begin in Southern Texas.  Congressman Gohmert, you represent the people of  Texas, your thoughts on this.  Do you get more border wall funding in the  budget?  What do you say? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I've said each of the last two weeks, we were in session in  September that, you know, the Trump voters will come out in 2020.  They've  seen the president do all he could.  But they haven't seen us try to help  the president really at all, and we ought to put money in.  If we don't put  money in for the president to build a wall before the election, there's a  good chance we'll lose the majority.  Nobody listened.  We lose majority. </p><p>The least we can do is get money in there now and I know that we're working  on that I've talked to people that we have elected in leadership positions  that are trying to make sure we get something done to help the president  with the border wall.  The best thing we can do for the people of Mexico  and Central America is get a wall, built where we need it, secure the  border, cut off the hundreds of billions of dollars that have flowed for  drugs, for human trafficking, for sex trafficking because once we cut that  off then the corruption in Mexico comes to a crawl and it becomes one of  the top 10 economies in the world. </p><p>It should have already been if we had nipped the drug cartels, but we  haven't done that.  This president is going to do it for you. </p><p>LEE:  So, congressman, we know that immigration was one of the number one  issues to voters out there.  There's been a lot of criticism since the  election saying that Republicans used the caravan in a scare tactic to sort  of stoke that and make immigration more important and hope that they, you  know, would get into office and then they dropped it ever since.  How do  you respond to that now as the caravan is getting closer and we've got this  right in front of us? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I'm just grateful that, you know, alt-left and media like  CNN, MSNBC now realized, oh, there really are people.  It was not just an  election rouse.  These people have continued to come and they are a threat  to our sovereignty.  If we cannot enforce our borders then like Woodrow  Wilson did, when my least favorite president when he put 75,000 national  guard on the border after Pancho Villa came in and killed Americans.  I  mean this is something we've got to do. </p><p>There were seven -- over 70,000 Americans killed last year by the poison  that is being sold to us by the drug cartels.  This is important.  We got  to stop it.  We got to quit enriching the drug cartels and if we let these  folks in then there's just going to be wave after wave until we can kiss  the America we knew goodbye.  You have to have people that understand how  to keep a self-government and these folks don't know how to do that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Although Woodrow Wilson as a fellow Virginian, he's also behind  basically the arrival of the income tax in the United States, so that's  something to dislike about him as well. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Oh, he's my least favorite, yes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, thank you. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Thank you so much, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, no, I got one -- I'll move on to another topic,  Justice Department showdown President Trump addressing acting Attorney  General Matthew Whitaker's role and potentially limiting Special Counsel  Robert Mueller's probe during a Fox News interview yesterday.  Listen to  this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  It's going to be up to him.  I think he's very well aware  politically.  I think he's astute politically.  He's a very smart person.   A very respected person.  He's going do what's right.  I really believe  he's going to do what's right. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes  weighed in on what will happen to investigations over FISA abuse  allegations when the Democrats take over the House.  Here's what he told  Maria on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  We have three  buckets of information that we want declassified.  We now have a fourth  bucket that we want declassified.  The president has called for three of  those four to be declassified.  This begs an investigation by the  Department of Justice.  So either the Department of Justice under new  leadership can actually go in and investigate these cast of dirty cops is  really what they were and their connections to the Russians and their  connections to the Clinton campaign. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, your reaction to this and I just also want to point  out that John Roberts is reporting that the president will not be  submitting answers to Robert Mueller's team today, those written answers  they have been talked about, so your reaction to what you just heard. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I've worked with some of the folks on the Intel Committee  and they're doing all they can.  The president got some bad advice and  pulling back from declassifying all of the material that was being sought.   That stuff needs to come out.  It -- and he was told that it takes -- it's  a long slow process.  People that know told me we could get it done in an  hour if we're allowed to do that.  And so, we have got to get this stuff  out.  But as far as Matt Whitaker, I mean Matt is a great guy. </p><p>He's a great American.  He should have protected his boss better from those  that work for Rosenstein that have been undermining him.  I went over and  told Jeff who is undermining him and what they're doing and went over and  talked to Matt, and they -- he did not protect his boss.  And now, he's in  his boss' job.  But let me -- let me say this real quick, Dagen, you know,  you picked a jury.  You're not entitled to jurors that it never had an  opinion. </p><p>What you're entitled to is somebody that will be fair going forward and  making appropriate determinations.  They're not entitled to a brain-dead  acting attorney general and Matt is doing fine.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, good to see you.  Congressman Louie Gohmert, we'll  see you soon.  </p><p>GOHMERT:  Good to see you, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come up -- coming up, Florida recount chaos, the details as  Republican Governor Rick Scott wins the Senate seat in the Sunshine State.   More ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Republican Rick Scott officially defeating Democrat Bill Nelson  in the Florida Senate race.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Hey, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Took a while.  That's true,  Dagen.  Incumbent Bill Nelson conceding in the Senate race to Governor Rick  Scott after a hand recount. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D-FL), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious in  this race.  But I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  We may have been heavily outspent in this this campaign, but we  were never outworked.  To all Floridians, whether you voted for me or for  my opponent, or that you didn't vote at all, I ask you to never give up  this fight. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Scott issuing a statement saying, \"I just spoke with Senator  Bill Nelson who graciously conceded and I thanked him for his years of  public service.\"  Scott's win gets Florida two Republican Senators for the  first time in more than a century.  Meanwhile, Florida embattled Broward  County election official Brenda Snipes has reportedly resigned following  heavy criticism over her handling of vote in the midterm election. </p><p>Well, Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested.  The automaker making  the announcement at a news conference in Tokyo just moments ago.  The  company is going to propose ousting Ghosn at a board meeting that's being  held on Thursday after they uncovered significant acts of misconduct.   Japanese media say that Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo after meeting with  prosecutors on suspicion that he falsified his financial reports including  allegedly under reporting his income by millions. </p><p>Nissan also confirming that board member Greg Kelly is also under arrest  this morning.  Ghosn rescued Nissan from their bankruptcy starting back at  1999.  He's also the chairman and chief executive which I should say of  Nissan's partner Renault.  French President Emanuel Macron says that France  wants to ensure stability at the auto alliance and they will protect those  workers at Renault.  Shares of Nissan we should are down nearly 10 percent  so far this year. </p><p>Well, Canada Goose wants customers to put a thousand dollar parkas to the  test against the harshest of conditions, so much another adding get this  frigid rooms to some stores.  You can test the high-end coat in  temperatures as low as negative 13.  The rooms even come with a wind-chill  button.  This is very interesting new approach as part of the company's  plan to increasingly sell directly to consumers instead of relying on  wholesalers like they have done in the past. </p><p>I think it's a great idea, Dagen, and you know what you're dealing with  before you get out there and catch pneumonia because your coat is not warm  enough. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a great idea buying -- never mind. </p><p>CASONE:  One thousand dollar coat.  I -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is the fur thing.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- there are a lot of other things on the planet that can keep  you warm without fur.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, a path of  destruction.  We have live to California as officials say the deadly  wildfire isn't even halfway finished burning yet.  Plus, a tale of two  cities, why New York City's mayor is backing Amazon's decision to setup  shop in the Big Apply but not Wal-Mart, guess why?  I think you can.  More  on the story straight ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Futures are pointing to a lower open this morning.  But there  are also lows of the morning so far 44-point loss on the Dow futures right  now as investors watch negotiations with China.  We do have some retail  earnings coming out this week.  I think investors will be looking for any  sign that the holiday shopping season is going to be a strong one as we get  close to a Thanksgiving and the kind of unofficial start of the shopping  season.  James, your thoughts on where markets are right now? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So we're not seeing a huge dip maybe a lot of trade concern  priced and a lot of negative expectations about this negotiations priced  in, and if our friend, Mr. Scaramucci is right and Mr. Gohmert is right,  and you actually get a quick resolution of this that would suggest there's  a lot of room to run for these markets.  </p><p>LI:  But one of the main drags right now in the premarket is Apple once  again which dipped into correction territory.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting that even more suppliers (INAUDIBLE) reducing their outlook for  the year because they don't expect as many orders to come from Apple in the  future.  So I guess the markets are lacking leadership and there are  concerns about economic growth going into next year which Goldman Sachs  says will only grow in the one percent area. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I worry about any infrastructure spending bill that the  Democrats and Republicans try to get done together given where our debt and  our deficits are right now, and what that could do to interest rates  because if you're worried about interest rates here, you're going to be  biting your fingernails when the 10-year yield is at three and a half  percent -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- four percent. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Maybe in terms of if you're hoping for some pro-growth  legislation to come out next year, maybe there's an immigration deal where  you can allow more legal immigration.  I think that would be the only hope. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to the devastation in California.  A pair of  wildfires leaving at least 80 people dead, nearly 1,000 people are still  unaccounted for.  Jonathan Hunt has the latest in Malibu, California.   Jonathan? </p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, good morning to you.   The flames are no longer the issue either in and around the Camp Fire in  Northern California nor in the Woolsey Fire down here in Southern  California.  The fires are under control.  But the big concern now  particularly around the Camp Fire up in the north is the ongoing search for  bodies.  As you mentioned, there are still close to 1,000 people listed as  unaccounted for and teams have been going through what remains of the town  of Paradise desperately trying to search for any human remains that may  help them identify some of the missing. </p><p>It's a race against time because rain is coming in the next 24 to 36 hours.   And when you're talking about properties that have been burned to tiny  pieces of ash finding human remains is difficult enough.  If the rains come  in and wash a lot of those ashes away, it will become even more difficult.   Meantime though, there was a vigil held near Paradise, California for those  who survived the deadly fires.  That was held last night.  A lot of people  showing up simply because they wanted to be in the presence of other  survivors.  Listen here. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARRIE LYNN, PARADISE RESIDENT:  I just know that God is comforting us as  far as imagine and we're living in.  It's really -- and then I look around  at all the kindness. </p><p>JOE FLORENCE, PARADISE RESIDENT:  My wife is -- she needs some closure.  To  be around other people that have gone through the same thing that we have,  it helps with the grieving process. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HUNT:  Here in Southern California, in Malibu in particular, many residents  are being allowed back in.  Although, a lot of them are finding this.  You  can see behind me that they have pretty much nothing left.  Also concerns  about rain coming here this week.  Dagen, you can't see to my right in this  dark, but we're beneath the Santa Monica Mountains.  When you get these  fires, it burns away all the brush, all the trees.  That essentially means  there's no anchors for the topsoil on there. </p><p>You get the rains.  We get mudslides.  We saw it last year after the big  fires in Santa Barbara followed by deadly mudslides.  That is now the fear  here in Malibu, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jonathan, thank you for all your reporting.  Jonathan Hunt in  Malibu for us.  </p><p>HUNT:  Sure. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, battle over Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May now  issuing a stark warning to opponents threatening to unseat her.  Former  foreign policy adviser former under Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is  weighing in on those negotiations.  That is next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo, it's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure to start this shortened holiday week, Futures lower across  the board; 52-point loss on the Dow Futures right now after a losing week  for all three major market gauges last week.  In Europe, some mixed market  action we have right now, all of the markets there are up but FTSE and the  CAC in France have been toggling back-and-forth between negative and  positive, but green across the board right now.  </p><p>This as British Prime Minister Theresa May assures Britain that ousting her  will not make Britain's exit from the European Union any easier.  And then  we move on to protests in France, the newest problem facing President  Emmanuel Macron that has the French taking to the streets.  Asian markets  finishing higher overnight; gains across the board on all four major  markets there.</p><p>Facebook, under more fire.  First details on why CEO Mark Zuckerberg  reportedly has the company on red alert, then a report on why cutting back  on the social media site is good for your mental health.  And then,  Amazon's big move from super secrecy during the headquartered two selection  process to hot shots from \"Saturday Night Live\" over weekend.  That and  more, the latest from the online retailer. </p><p>To our top story this half-hour.  Moving the plan forward, British Prime  Minister Theresa May is selling agreement for great Britain's exit from the  European Union.  The British leader citing her deal's tough measures on  immigration is one of its strengths; May re-enforcing her resolve to see  this through to the end earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  My job is to get the best deal.   Parliament must then examine it and do what is in national interest.  We  have in view a deal that will work for the U.K. and let no one be in any  doubt, I am determined to deliver it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here now, Director of the Thatcher Center for Freedom at the  Heritage Foundation, Nile Gardiner.  Now, your reaction to Theresa May's  comments and her handling of the Brexit.  </p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF THE THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM AT THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Well, good morning.  I have to say that Theresa May's handling  of the Brexit negotiations have been absolutely disastrous.  In effect,  it's really been a surrender to the European Union.  And the proposal that  she has put forward is completely unacceptable.  It, basically, makes  Britain subservient to the European Union; it does not take Britain outside  of the E.U. Customs Union, the U.K. will not able to sign free trade  agreements including with the United States.  So, this is a deal that does  not restore British sovereignty and self-determination and freedom to the  British people.  </p><p>So, Theresa May, I think, has not lived up to the promises she made to the  British people earlier.  And in many ways, and this is an appalling weak- kneed deal offered by the British prime minister, which is being heavily  opposed by a large number of MPs within her party and she's faced a wave of  resignations, there'll be more resignations to come.  She could indeed face  a vote of \"no\" confidence later this week, if enough conservative MPs come  forward to call for such a vote.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Nile, James Freeman here with the Wall Street Journal.  It sounds  like you're more in camp of wanting what we call hard Brexit, do you feel  like there would be an opportunity for the U.K. out of the E.U. to do a  trade deal, perhaps join our new NAFTA-USMCA, perhaps other moves.  Can you  give us your forecast for if Britain leaves the E.U. completely?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, Brexit definitely taking place on March 29, 2019.  It's a  matter of what kind of Brexit it is.  And the British people in 2016 voted  in huge number: 17.4 million Britons voted to leave the European Union;  they understood that they were leaving the single market and customs union  when they voted.  That was the key message from the voted leave campaign,  the official campaign to vote to leave the European Union.  </p><p>And so, the British people want to see their sovereignty restored.  Theresa  May's deal does not deliver that; it's far better, I think, for Britain to  -- either renegotiate this new May proposal or seek a \"no\" deal Brexit  where Britain trades with the rest of the world under WTO terms also trades  with E.U. under WTO terms.  It would be far preferable, I think, to what  Theresa May is offering which is a deal that shackles Britain indefinitely  to the European Union, that's not what British people voted for.  </p><p>CARTER:  Is there anyone -- I'm curious, because it was so divided when  Brexit was voted on and there were so many people who wanted to say, is  there anyone right now who looks at this deal and says, I'm happy that  we're not doing a hard exit -- is there any of the constituents here who  said this is, this is what we should be doing?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, certainly there are, you know, some supporters of Theresa  May within the conservative party.  There are also, I think, big business  interests who have backed the Theresa May proposal.  There are also many  business leaders who oppose this deal as well.  So, certainly, there has  been a mixed reaction to this, but if you look at the public opinion polls,  there is less than 20 percent support for the Theresa May deal right now.   It's deeply unpopular.  There's a lack of trust in the prime minister and  she's no Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May, that's for sure.  </p><p>Margaret Thatcher would've negotiated a tough deal in the British national  interests.  In addition, Theresa May has pledged to hand over 39 billion  pounds to European Union for nothing in return.  I think the, you know, the  British have been treated with utter, you know, disdain and contempt by  European Union, and this is a sheer blackmail from the E.U. here and should  not give in to these demands.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So, it sounds like you're not a Theresa May fan, is  that fair to characterize you that way?  Does she need to go?  </p><p>GARDINER:  I have to say, she's been hugely disappointing and I think if  she faces a vote of \"no\" confidence, there's a very good chance, I think,  that we could see a new prime minister by the end of this year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move across the channel to France.  Protests erupting  over increased taxes on fuel, now what do these protests say about the  popularity of Macron's presidency?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Uh, well, I think -- you know, Emmanuel Macron's presidency has  been nothing short of disastrous, really.  He has an opinion poll rating at  around, sort of, 21 percentage points which is not exactly a vote of  confidence from the French people.  I think that Emmanuel Macron is seen as  deeply out of touch, as arrogant, as someone who doesn't understand the  concerns of ordinary French voters.  He's a politician, I think, he was  full of, sort of, you know, grand visionary ideas, that cannot understand,  you know, why his own voters don't -- you know, don't support him anymore.  </p><p>And this latest fuel tax which hits tens of millions of French drivers is  deeply unpopular, that's fueling the protests, but Emmanuel Macron, I  think, as somebody who really lives in a sort of another, you know,  political dimension, who dreams of creating a grand European Union Army  while his own people around from the streets protesting against his  leadership, so I think there's a lot of delusional thinking, actually, in  the Elysee Palace these days under Emmanuel Macron.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nile, this is a conversation I had over the weekend with  someone, that the socialists, the kind of new born American socialist that  we hear from quite often, they kind of preach that if we just tax the one  percent more, we can pay for all of these lovely things that Americans  need, but that is not what goes on in other nations, say, across Europe.   The people of these nations -- and I look at France, are taxed to their  teeth, in the form of gas taxes, you name -- value-added taxes.  It's not  just the one percent that's paying for if everything.  </p><p>And in fact, in this country, if you confiscated every single dollar that  the top one percent earned in adjusted growth income, it wouldn't be enough  money to pay for Medicare for all, it' would be two trillion versus 3.2.  trillion.  You would have to confiscate every dollar of adjusted growth  income from the top five percent and that would only pay for Medicare for  all and these protests kind of speak to that. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes, I think, you know, French people have had enough of, you  know, huge state taxes and, you know, France has been basically, sort of, a  big government, sort of, economic you know, basket case for successive  decades thanks to, you know, to high tax policies.  You know, hundreds of  thousands of French citizens have fled to London over the past decade  seeking jobs and opportunities in lower taxes, actually and so you've got  economic refugees leaving France heading to -- especially to the U.K. where  there's a lower tax regime and more free market policies.  </p><p>And basically, I think, increasing Europeans are rejecting socialist style  government -- and at the end of the day, Emmanuel Macron is a big  government thinker, he talks about, you know, free trade, he talks about  free markets.  But in reality, you know, France remains whetted to very  high levels of taxation, it has high levels of unemployment; Emmanuel  Macron is at heart a protectionist he's someone who calls Brexit a crime.   You know, this is a leader who, I think, is just deeply out of touch with,  you know, his own -- you know, his own people and I think is the reflection  of the huge economic problems that you see across big government high tax  European Union today.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, he -- obviously, Macron came into office promising the  opposite: A more dynamic economy.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  A more open economy in France, I guess it hasn't happened,  exactly.  </p><p>GARDINER:  That is not that -- that is not materialized at all.  And in  fact, I think, you know, Emmanuel Macron's big priority right now is a  creation of some sort of grand European Union super state.  So, he is  leader of the Euro Federalist in Europe and its latest plan calls to build  a European Union Army which he calls -- calls for to challenge the United  States.  And so, this is the mindset of the, of the French president right  now, completely delusional and out of touch with reality altogether.  And  so, it's hard to see how Emmanuel Macron is going to be re-elected in 2022  at this rate.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What are they using baguettes as spears and power of taxation to  frighten everyone?  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  Thank you so much, sir.   Great to see you, Nile Gardiner.</p><p>GARDINER:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.  Facebook fallout Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney  that is, will weigh in on how the Web site can make people depressed.   \"Saturday Night Live\" poking fun at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVE CARELL, ACTOR:  Hi everyone, as you know, Amazon just announced  location of its two new headquarters in New York and Virginia.  And  everyone, except for the people who live there and people who live in all  the places we didn't choose, is thrilled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More of Steve Carell.  We have to say thank you to Susan Li,  you'll catch her at the New York Stock Exchange all day.  She's working  hard, stay with us, Varney straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More fallout for Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg under fire over  his reactions to damaging reports about the company.  And now, a new study  also shows it can make you depressed.  Joining me now is the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  OK.  Actually, there is a new  study.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And it is objective.  It's from the University of Pennsylvania.   Now, this has got nothing to do with Facebook's data breaches or their, you  know, censorship of conservative opinion, this is something completely  separate.  This is getting used to this new thing, social networks.  Well,  the University of Pennsylvania studied I think 140, 150 undergraduates at  the college, and for some of them, half of them, they took away their  social network usage.  Then just limited to 10 minutes a day, that half of  the study, their mood all improved.  No more depression, no more, what --  less depression, less anxiety.  The other group which stayed with social  networks hours and hours and hours a day, no improvement in mood  whatsoever.  Apparently, this is the first cause and effect study that's  being recognized as Facebook can give you depression.</p><p>Now, this occur -- it occurs to me that, you know, younger person, you're  on Facebook, and you're scrolling through other people's lives, and all the  people's lives on Facebook are always wonderful, great boyfriend, great  girlfriend, fabulous family, new job, new house, wonderful vacation on the  beach, you got it all.  But what about you?  You look bad in comparison to  all of your friends and relatives who are looking so good on Facebook.  So  you get depressed because you're not enjoying life like they are.  And it's  a way -- we have to get used to this thing, it's not going to go away.   But, we have to get used to how to use it, and I don't think we're there  yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I stopped using Facebook, and even before that, Stuart, I lied  about virtually every bit of information I ever gave them.  I am actually  25 years of age according to Facebook whereabouts.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, and I'm 39.  You know, that's life, but I -- actually, I  don't use Facebook.  I don't do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You have other -- you're out cutting brush and doing things  outdoors, so I can't imagine you ever having time to like scroll through  recipes for ooey gooey butter cake on Facebook.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're absolutely right there, Dagen.  And no contest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just do not see that being your bag, Mr. Varney.</p><p>VARNEY:  Not me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not at all.  But doing T.V. is, and Stuart is coming up in about  10 minutes' time every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Stuart  Varney 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Thank you, Stuart, great to see you, my friend.</p><p>Coming up, a tale two of cities, why New York City's Mayor is backing  Amazon's decision to set up shop in the Big Apple, and the hand-outs and  perks Amazon got.  But no Wal-Mart.  Guess why, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Headquarter headache, Amazon facing fallout over its big move to  New York City from people all over the political spectrum.  Lauren  Simonetti has the latest.  Hey, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Dagen, didn't you  know that some big businesses are good and others are bad?  Well, at least  that's the rationale merging from New York City's winning bid for Amazon's  second headquarters or part of it.  Mayor Bill de Blasio bring up his  efforts to keep Wal-Mart out in response while on a local radio program on  Friday.  This is what he said, \"I was actively involved in the effort to  keep Wal-Mart out of New York City.  Wal-Mart is an entirely different  universe in terms of the systematic efforts they've taken to undermine  labor, small business, the environment, American workers, and obviously,  the politics of the Walton family.  Wal-Mart does not belong in New York  City.\"</p><p>Yes, he's rolling out the red carpet for Amazon, though, which also doesn't  support unions, which also kills off mom and pops, and hasn't put his money  where CEO Jeff Bezos' politics are or at least where the politics of his  newspaper at The Washington Post are.  Whereas this was interesting, I did  some research on this, Wal-Mart's Walton family has given money to  democratic politicians in the past including the Governor of New York  Andrew Cuomo.  But let's get back to basics, he was played by Steve Carell,  must-see T.V.  This was \"Saturday Night Live\" watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARELL:  Some folks have speculated that I was somehow trolling President  Trump by building one headquarters in his hometown of Queens, and the other  in his current residence of Washington D.C., thereby overshadowing or  humiliating them, but that's simply not true.  Sure, he attacked me  repeatedly on Twitter, but I chose our new locations because they were  ideal for growing business, not just to make Donald Trump think about how  I'm literally 100 times richer that he is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It was awesome.  I love the part where they put up all the  Twitter attacks.  You know, the SNL writers only knew the dog codenames  that he -- that the company gave for the 20 finalists competing for the  second quarters.  Crystal City, Virginia or Arlington (INAUDIBLE) New York  (INAUDIBLE) so the Amazon is very dog-friendly.  They basically gave each  of the cities a dog name for their codename.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But by -- can we go back to the de Blasio thing.  Because you  don't like -- you don't actually like the perks, the tax perks that New  York City got, but in terms of the politics, no company helps lower-income  Americans more than a Wal-Mart, and giving people easy access to very  inexpensive goods and groceries, so they are on par with Amazon.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, thank God -- thank goodness Mr. de Blasio is not running the  country.  This idea that I'm going to treat businesses differently because  I don't like the politics of their owners, this is -- this is the New York  Model, it's keep taxes very high, and no businesses would want to come  here, so then decide particular businesses that you like to give big  incentives to.  There, just lower rates for everybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mayor Pothole will never be President Pothole.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lauren Simonetti, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Freeman, Carter, thank you.</p><p>CARTER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's all about Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney.  Take it away, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, thank you so much.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p>We break it all down.  </p><p>Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p>The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p>In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p>In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p>Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p>But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p>But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p>And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p>And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p>Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p>Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p>And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p>And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p>And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p>So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p>So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p>So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p>Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p>And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p>So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p>Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p>But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p>Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p>I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p>And second of all -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p>I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p>But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p>And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p>LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p>LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p>LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p>LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p>They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p>But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p>I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p>CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p>And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p>So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p>LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p>But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p>LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p>And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p>But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p>CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p>These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p>Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p>LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.

When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p>So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p>LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p>I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>CARTER:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.

Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p>She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p>Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.

He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p>\"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p>In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p>Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p>One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p>CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p>CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p>So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p>Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p>LI:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p>We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p>Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p>A full roundup, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p>A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p>Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p>Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p>Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p>The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p>So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p>President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p>But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p>Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p>JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.

Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p>Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p>He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p>There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p>And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p>And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p>Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p>ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p>So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p>Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p>I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p>And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p>I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p>And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p>So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p>Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p>The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p>So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p>Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p>But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p>I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p>And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p>The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p>Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p>Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p>With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p>And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p>And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p>I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p>We'll tell you more.  </p><p>And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p>Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p>More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p>In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p>Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p>From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p>We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p>Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p>RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p>And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p>And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p>No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p>Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p>And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p>But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p>Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p>But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p>I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p>I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p>CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p>And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p>And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p>And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p>I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p>LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p>MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p>You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p>Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p>MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.

U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.

The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.

Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p>Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.   Though, she said she would like to get to call a couple of plates for  Browns, and open doors for women in coaching. </p><p>Watch this Formula 3 crash, at 171 miles per hour.  17-year-old German,  Sophia Floersch, fractured her spine, fractured a facial bone, suffered  concussion and other lacerations; 170 miles per hour at the Macau Grand  Prix in China.  She says, I'm fine but will go into surgery tomorrow.   NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series championship, Homestead, Miami, 12 laps to  go -- oh, well, this is actually before the race.  The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p>CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p>MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p>CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p>MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p>MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p>MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p>CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p>CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p>MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p>MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p>MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p>CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p>This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p>In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.

The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, November 19th, Happy  Thanksgiving, a little early.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern,  markets under pressure this morning.  Futures are down across the board, an  83-point loss on the Dow futures.  This after a down week for all three  market gauges.  The Dow and NASDAQ both falling more than two percent last  week. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 hurt a little less, but was off more than 1-1/2 percent.  In  Europe, we do have gains to report in England and in France at the moment.   The DAX Index down ever so slightly.  But it was a winning start to the  week in Asia, all four major markets there to the plus side.  This despite  rising trade tensions with China.  Vice President Mike Pence back from the  Asia-Pacific Summit without an accord.  Now, the focus shifts to next  week's G20 Summit where President Trump is set to meet with China's  President Xi Jinping. </p><p>Trouble for Nissan, reports say that Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been  arrested for alleged financial violations in Japan.  The automaker holding  a news conference shortly where it is expected to announce Carlos Ghosn's  removal as chairman.  Devastation in California, crews searching for  victims of the deadly Camp Fire that has left at least 77 dead and nearly  unaccounted for.  We will have a live report from the ground in California. </p><p>Plus, Theresa May standing firm, why the British Prime Minister says that  ousting her will not make the U.K. exit from the European Union any easier.   And it's a cool idea, one company is going the extra mile to make sure its  coats are good fit.  Here to break it all down with me this morning, Fox  Business Network's Susan Li, along with Wall Street Journal Assistant  Editorial Page Editor James Freeman, and pollster and President of  Maslansky + Partners Lee Carter. </p><p>I was trying to get Lee to give the bath bomb young women a free advice -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Happy to do it.  Happy to do  it.  Just a short segment. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I know on air, no.  I'm just kidding.  So much to discuss.   I can't wake to talk about trade, Apple, Facebook.  We much to explore in  the next hour.  But let's move on to trade tensions flaring between the  world's two biggest economies just ahead of talk between President Trump  and China Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit.  Edward Lawrence is live from the  White House with more.  Good morning, Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   The world is watching this trade dispute at a meeting over the weekend at  the Asian-Pacific Cooperation Summit.  The leaders could not come up with a  statement in part because of the Chinese and U.S. positions respectively.   Now, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended that conference along with Vice  President Mike Pence.  Now, the vice president will be here at the White  House later on today to brief the president on exactly what happened there. </p><p>Well, Chinese media now reporting that their vice premier will not come to  Washington, D.C. this week.  He was supposed to lay the groundwork with  treasury officials for that bilateral meeting with President Xi and  President Donald Trump in Buenos Aires later on this month.  That meeting  will now happen between the ministers after the presidential meeting on  December 1st.  Now, last week, the Chinese sent a list to the U.S. of what  they would like to see changed in order to have a trade agreement between  the two countries. </p><p>The president on Friday saying this was a long list and some things not a  good list.  But, again, he says it's a start.  Now, talking with Chris  Wallace over the weekend, he says, his tone is what's given him this  presidential wins and a good economy including on trade. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Because you have people  coming at you so hard that if you don't fight back in a somewhat vigorous  way, you're not going to win. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And as that talk at the president has $267 billion more of  Chinese goods that he could possibly put under tariffs.  On Friday, the  president saying he's going to hold off on that.  We'll see what happens  out of this meeting between he and President Xi, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Edward.  Edward Lawrence for us at the White House.   Joining us now is House Judiciary Committee member Texas Congressman Louie  Gohmert.  Congressman, your take on this and the state of trade in our  relationship with China. </p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  Well, I know a lot of people are upset  that, oh, it appears to be breaking down.  But I recall, the best  negotiating that Reagan ever did was when Gorbachev said get rid of the  missile defense and you can have everything else you want, and he got up  and left the table.  It was the best thing he ever did.  It led to a great  deal for us and eventually to the demise of the Soviet Union.  We're not  looking for the demise of China. </p><p>But I know there are some senators that say, we need to pass a bill that  get rid of the tariffs or the ability the president threatened tariffs.  He  is a deal maker and you know when it's about business, it's good to have a  businessman.  I was told years ago by a U.S. trade rep, Louie, you got to  understand that we know we have the biggest economy in the world, so when  we make a trade deal that's better for other countries than us, it really  inures to our benefit. </p><p>Well, garbage.  We -- if it's better for them, it's better for them and we  got a guy that knows how to negotiate and uses leverage in this case  tariffs. </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you that  over in the Pacific after this APEC Summit, my sources are saying that it's  all been shaken up because I guess Asian tradition goes with process,  procedure, and what they know best, right?  So with this president shaking  things up, it's, you know, some people are calling this a new front, a new  cold war that is taking place between the U.S. and China, your thoughts? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, it's been pretty cool for a long time because China has  been stealing our goods, stealing our technology, so the war was going on.   It was just a one-sided -- </p><p>LI:  Would you call it a cold war though, is that how you would  characterize the relationship? </p><p>GOHMERT:  It's a little bit if not -- it's freezing.  It's tepid.  It's  always been because China is not out to see the United States end up doing  well.  So only to the extent that they get paid back the money we owe them,  so, yes.  It's -- maybe not a cold war but a cool war.  But it's still  doesn't mean you can't negotiate.  But you got to use leverage and I'm  thankful we got a president knows how to make deals. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman maybe frosty would be a good work.  Continue. </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I'm wondering how long it stays  frosty.  You seem, congressman, optimistic that there is going to be a deal  here.  Do you foresee it in the immediate term here or do you think this  goes on for a while? </p><p>GOHMERT:  It's completely up to the Chinese.  I see that we will eventually  get a deal because the Chinese they're not stupid.  They know that when  there is a tariff war usually neither side of the tariff war wins.  But the  president should not have the leverage removed.  It, you know, every time  he brings up tariffs, he usually has the backdoors.  Now, if you work out a  trade deal with us then we'll be able to forget about the tariffs. </p><p>So I think we will get that worked out and it will be to the United States'  benefit instead of continuing to make another deal that hurts us -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, how quickly -- how quickly can -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know.  Just really -- how quickly can you get the U.S.- Mexico-Canada deal approved?  </p><p>GOHMERT:  Oh, I think it will be approved very quickly, yes.  That's going  to be good better for us than NAFTA.  Napa, NAFTA.  I've got Napa on the  brain.  I feel sorry for those folks.  They've been through it.  But, you  know, I think we'll get it approve very quickly.  I don't think it will be  that big of a problem. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to the border, hundreds of Tijuana residents  protesting the arrival of thousands of migrants yesterday attempting to  enter the United States.  This comes as border wall construction will soon  begin in Southern Texas.  Congressman Gohmert, you represent the people of  Texas, your thoughts on this.  Do you get more border wall funding in the  budget?  What do you say? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I've said each of the last two weeks, we were in session in  September that, you know, the Trump voters will come out in 2020.  They've  seen the president do all he could.  But they haven't seen us try to help  the president really at all, and we ought to put money in.  If we don't put  money in for the president to build a wall before the election, there's a  good chance we'll lose the majority.  Nobody listened.  We lose majority. </p><p>The least we can do is get money in there now and I know that we're working  on that I've talked to people that we have elected in leadership positions  that are trying to make sure we get something done to help the president  with the border wall.  The best thing we can do for the people of Mexico  and Central America is get a wall, built where we need it, secure the  border, cut off the hundreds of billions of dollars that have flowed for  drugs, for human trafficking, for sex trafficking because once we cut that  off then the corruption in Mexico comes to a crawl and it becomes one of  the top 10 economies in the world. </p><p>It should have already been if we had nipped the drug cartels, but we  haven't done that.  This president is going to do it for you. </p><p>LEE:  So, congressman, we know that immigration was one of the number one  issues to voters out there.  There's been a lot of criticism since the  election saying that Republicans used the caravan in a scare tactic to sort  of stoke that and make immigration more important and hope that they, you  know, would get into office and then they dropped it ever since.  How do  you respond to that now as the caravan is getting closer and we've got this  right in front of us? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I'm just grateful that, you know, alt-left and media like  CNN, MSNBC now realized, oh, there really are people.  It was not just an  election rouse.  These people have continued to come and they are a threat  to our sovereignty.  If we cannot enforce our borders then like Woodrow  Wilson did, when my least favorite president when he put 75,000 national  guard on the border after Pancho Villa came in and killed Americans.  I  mean this is something we've got to do. </p><p>There were seven -- over 70,000 Americans killed last year by the poison  that is being sold to us by the drug cartels.  This is important.  We got  to stop it.  We got to quit enriching the drug cartels and if we let these  folks in then there's just going to be wave after wave until we can kiss  the America we knew goodbye.  You have to have people that understand how  to keep a self-government and these folks don't know how to do that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Although Woodrow Wilson as a fellow Virginian, he's also behind  basically the arrival of the income tax in the United States, so that's  something to dislike about him as well. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Oh, he's my least favorite, yes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, thank you. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Thank you so much, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, no, I got one -- I'll move on to another topic,  Justice Department showdown President Trump addressing acting Attorney  General Matthew Whitaker's role and potentially limiting Special Counsel  Robert Mueller's probe during a Fox News interview yesterday.  Listen to  this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  It's going to be up to him.  I think he's very well aware  politically.  I think he's astute politically.  He's a very smart person.   A very respected person.  He's going do what's right.  I really believe  he's going to do what's right. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes  weighed in on what will happen to investigations over FISA abuse  allegations when the Democrats take over the House.  Here's what he told  Maria on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  We have three  buckets of information that we want declassified.  We now have a fourth  bucket that we want declassified.  The president has called for three of  those four to be declassified.  This begs an investigation by the  Department of Justice.  So either the Department of Justice under new  leadership can actually go in and investigate these cast of dirty cops is  really what they were and their connections to the Russians and their  connections to the Clinton campaign. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, your reaction to this and I just also want to point  out that John Roberts is reporting that the president will not be  submitting answers to Robert Mueller's team today, those written answers  they have been talked about, so your reaction to what you just heard. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I've worked with some of the folks on the Intel Committee  and they're doing all they can.  The president got some bad advice and  pulling back from declassifying all of the material that was being sought.   That stuff needs to come out.  It -- and he was told that it takes -- it's  a long slow process.  People that know told me we could get it done in an  hour if we're allowed to do that.  And so, we have got to get this stuff  out.  But as far as Matt Whitaker, I mean Matt is a great guy. </p><p>He's a great American.  He should have protected his boss better from those  that work for Rosenstein that have been undermining him.  I went over and  told Jeff who is undermining him and what they're doing and went over and  talked to Matt, and they -- he did not protect his boss.  And now, he's in  his boss' job.  But let me -- let me say this real quick, Dagen, you know,  you picked a jury.  You're not entitled to jurors that it never had an  opinion. </p><p>What you're entitled to is somebody that will be fair going forward and  making appropriate determinations.  They're not entitled to a brain-dead  acting attorney general and Matt is doing fine.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, good to see you.  Congressman Louie Gohmert, we'll  see you soon.  </p><p>GOHMERT:  Good to see you, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come up -- coming up, Florida recount chaos, the details as  Republican Governor Rick Scott wins the Senate seat in the Sunshine State.   More ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Republican Rick Scott officially defeating Democrat Bill Nelson  in the Florida Senate race.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Hey, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Took a while.  That's true,  Dagen.  Incumbent Bill Nelson conceding in the Senate race to Governor Rick  Scott after a hand recount. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D-FL), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious in  this race.  But I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  We may have been heavily outspent in this this campaign, but we  were never outworked.  To all Floridians, whether you voted for me or for  my opponent, or that you didn't vote at all, I ask you to never give up  this fight. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Scott issuing a statement saying, \"I just spoke with Senator  Bill Nelson who graciously conceded and I thanked him for his years of  public service.\"  Scott's win gets Florida two Republican Senators for the  first time in more than a century.  Meanwhile, Florida embattled Broward  County election official Brenda Snipes has reportedly resigned following  heavy criticism over her handling of vote in the midterm election. </p><p>Well, Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested.  The automaker making  the announcement at a news conference in Tokyo just moments ago.  The  company is going to propose ousting Ghosn at a board meeting that's being  held on Thursday after they uncovered significant acts of misconduct.   Japanese media say that Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo after meeting with  prosecutors on suspicion that he falsified his financial reports including  allegedly under reporting his income by millions. </p><p>Nissan also confirming that board member Greg Kelly is also under arrest  this morning.  Ghosn rescued Nissan from their bankruptcy starting back at  1999.  He's also the chairman and chief executive which I should say of  Nissan's partner Renault.  French President Emanuel Macron says that France  wants to ensure stability at the auto alliance and they will protect those  workers at Renault.  Shares of Nissan we should are down nearly 10 percent  so far this year. </p><p>Well, Canada Goose wants customers to put a thousand dollar parkas to the  test against the harshest of conditions, so much another adding get this  frigid rooms to some stores.  You can test the high-end coat in  temperatures as low as negative 13.  The rooms even come with a wind-chill  button.  This is very interesting new approach as part of the company's  plan to increasingly sell directly to consumers instead of relying on  wholesalers like they have done in the past. </p><p>I think it's a great idea, Dagen, and you know what you're dealing with  before you get out there and catch pneumonia because your coat is not warm  enough. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a great idea buying -- never mind. </p><p>CASONE:  One thousand dollar coat.  I -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is the fur thing.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- there are a lot of other things on the planet that can keep  you warm without fur.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, a path of  destruction.  We have live to California as officials say the deadly  wildfire isn't even halfway finished burning yet.  Plus, a tale of two  cities, why New York City's mayor is backing Amazon's decision to setup  shop in the Big Apply but not Wal-Mart, guess why?  I think you can.  More  on the story straight ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Futures are pointing to a lower open this morning.  But there  are also lows of the morning so far 44-point loss on the Dow futures right  now as investors watch negotiations with China.  We do have some retail  earnings coming out this week.  I think investors will be looking for any  sign that the holiday shopping season is going to be a strong one as we get  close to a Thanksgiving and the kind of unofficial start of the shopping  season.  James, your thoughts on where markets are right now? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So we're not seeing a huge dip maybe a lot of trade concern  priced and a lot of negative expectations about this negotiations priced  in, and if our friend, Mr. Scaramucci is right and Mr. Gohmert is right,  and you actually get a quick resolution of this that would suggest there's  a lot of room to run for these markets.  </p><p>LI:  But one of the main drags right now in the premarket is Apple once  again which dipped into correction territory.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting that even more suppliers (INAUDIBLE) reducing their outlook for  the year because they don't expect as many orders to come from Apple in the  future.  So I guess the markets are lacking leadership and there are  concerns about economic growth going into next year which Goldman Sachs  says will only grow in the one percent area. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I worry about any infrastructure spending bill that the  Democrats and Republicans try to get done together given where our debt and  our deficits are right now, and what that could do to interest rates  because if you're worried about interest rates here, you're going to be  biting your fingernails when the 10-year yield is at three and a half  percent -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- four percent. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Maybe in terms of if you're hoping for some pro-growth  legislation to come out next year, maybe there's an immigration deal where  you can allow more legal immigration.  I think that would be the only hope. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to the devastation in California.  A pair of  wildfires leaving at least 80 people dead, nearly 1,000 people are still  unaccounted for.  Jonathan Hunt has the latest in Malibu, California.   Jonathan? </p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, good morning to you.   The flames are no longer the issue either in and around the Camp Fire in  Northern California nor in the Woolsey Fire down here in Southern  California.  The fires are under control.  But the big concern now  particularly around the Camp Fire up in the north is the ongoing search for  bodies.  As you mentioned, there are still close to 1,000 people listed as  unaccounted for and teams have been going through what remains of the town  of Paradise desperately trying to search for any human remains that may  help them identify some of the missing. </p><p>It's a race against time because rain is coming in the next 24 to 36 hours.   And when you're talking about properties that have been burned to tiny  pieces of ash finding human remains is difficult enough.  If the rains come  in and wash a lot of those ashes away, it will become even more difficult.   Meantime though, there was a vigil held near Paradise, California for those  who survived the deadly fires.  That was held last night.  A lot of people  showing up simply because they wanted to be in the presence of other  survivors.  Listen here. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARRIE LYNN, PARADISE RESIDENT:  I just know that God is comforting us as  far as imagine and we're living in.  It's really -- and then I look around  at all the kindness. </p><p>JOE FLORENCE, PARADISE RESIDENT:  My wife is -- she needs some closure.  To  be around other people that have gone through the same thing that we have,  it helps with the grieving process. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HUNT:  Here in Southern California, in Malibu in particular, many residents  are being allowed back in.  Although, a lot of them are finding this.  You  can see behind me that they have pretty much nothing left.  Also concerns  about rain coming here this week.  Dagen, you can't see to my right in this  dark, but we're beneath the Santa Monica Mountains.  When you get these  fires, it burns away all the brush, all the trees.  That essentially means  there's no anchors for the topsoil on there. </p><p>You get the rains.  We get mudslides.  We saw it last year after the big  fires in Santa Barbara followed by deadly mudslides.  That is now the fear  here in Malibu, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jonathan, thank you for all your reporting.  Jonathan Hunt in  Malibu for us.  </p><p>HUNT:  Sure. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, battle over Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May now  issuing a stark warning to opponents threatening to unseat her.  Former  foreign policy adviser former under Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is  weighing in on those negotiations.  That is next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo, it's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure to start this shortened holiday week, Futures lower across  the board; 52-point loss on the Dow Futures right now after a losing week  for all three major market gauges last week.  In Europe, some mixed market  action we have right now, all of the markets there are up but FTSE and the  CAC in France have been toggling back-and-forth between negative and  positive, but green across the board right now.  </p><p>This as British Prime Minister Theresa May assures Britain that ousting her  will not make Britain's exit from the European Union any easier.  And then  we move on to protests in France, the newest problem facing President  Emmanuel Macron that has the French taking to the streets.  Asian markets  finishing higher overnight; gains across the board on all four major  markets there.</p><p>Facebook, under more fire.  First details on why CEO Mark Zuckerberg  reportedly has the company on red alert, then a report on why cutting back  on the social media site is good for your mental health.  And then,  Amazon's big move from super secrecy during the headquartered two selection  process to hot shots from \"Saturday Night Live\" over weekend.  That and  more, the latest from the online retailer. </p><p>To our top story this half-hour.  Moving the plan forward, British Prime  Minister Theresa May is selling agreement for great Britain's exit from the  European Union.  The British leader citing her deal's tough measures on  immigration is one of its strengths; May re-enforcing her resolve to see  this through to the end earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  My job is to get the best deal.   Parliament must then examine it and do what is in national interest.  We  have in view a deal that will work for the U.K. and let no one be in any  doubt, I am determined to deliver it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here now, Director of the Thatcher Center for Freedom at the  Heritage Foundation, Nile Gardiner.  Now, your reaction to Theresa May's  comments and her handling of the Brexit.  </p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF THE THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM AT THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Well, good morning.  I have to say that Theresa May's handling  of the Brexit negotiations have been absolutely disastrous.  In effect,  it's really been a surrender to the European Union.  And the proposal that  she has put forward is completely unacceptable.  It, basically, makes  Britain subservient to the European Union; it does not take Britain outside  of the E.U. Customs Union, the U.K. will not able to sign free trade  agreements including with the United States.  So, this is a deal that does  not restore British sovereignty and self-determination and freedom to the  British people.  </p><p>So, Theresa May, I think, has not lived up to the promises she made to the  British people earlier.  And in many ways, and this is an appalling weak- kneed deal offered by the British prime minister, which is being heavily  opposed by a large number of MPs within her party and she's faced a wave of  resignations, there'll be more resignations to come.  She could indeed face  a vote of \"no\" confidence later this week, if enough conservative MPs come  forward to call for such a vote.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Nile, James Freeman here with the Wall Street Journal.  It sounds  like you're more in camp of wanting what we call hard Brexit, do you feel  like there would be an opportunity for the U.K. out of the E.U. to do a  trade deal, perhaps join our new NAFTA-USMCA, perhaps other moves.  Can you  give us your forecast for if Britain leaves the E.U. completely?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, Brexit definitely taking place on March 29, 2019.  It's a  matter of what kind of Brexit it is.  And the British people in 2016 voted  in huge number: 17.4 million Britons voted to leave the European Union;  they understood that they were leaving the single market and customs union  when they voted.  That was the key message from the voted leave campaign,  the official campaign to vote to leave the European Union.  </p><p>And so, the British people want to see their sovereignty restored.  Theresa  May's deal does not deliver that; it's far better, I think, for Britain to  -- either renegotiate this new May proposal or seek a \"no\" deal Brexit  where Britain trades with the rest of the world under WTO terms also trades  with E.U. under WTO terms.  It would be far preferable, I think, to what  Theresa May is offering which is a deal that shackles Britain indefinitely  to the European Union, that's not what British people voted for.  </p><p>CARTER:  Is there anyone -- I'm curious, because it was so divided when  Brexit was voted on and there were so many people who wanted to say, is  there anyone right now who looks at this deal and says, I'm happy that  we're not doing a hard exit -- is there any of the constituents here who  said this is, this is what we should be doing?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, certainly there are, you know, some supporters of Theresa  May within the conservative party.  There are also, I think, big business  interests who have backed the Theresa May proposal.  There are also many  business leaders who oppose this deal as well.  So, certainly, there has  been a mixed reaction to this, but if you look at the public opinion polls,  there is less than 20 percent support for the Theresa May deal right now.   It's deeply unpopular.  There's a lack of trust in the prime minister and  she's no Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May, that's for sure.  </p><p>Margaret Thatcher would've negotiated a tough deal in the British national  interests.  In addition, Theresa May has pledged to hand over 39 billion  pounds to European Union for nothing in return.  I think the, you know, the  British have been treated with utter, you know, disdain and contempt by  European Union, and this is a sheer blackmail from the E.U. here and should  not give in to these demands.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So, it sounds like you're not a Theresa May fan, is  that fair to characterize you that way?  Does she need to go?  </p><p>GARDINER:  I have to say, she's been hugely disappointing and I think if  she faces a vote of \"no\" confidence, there's a very good chance, I think,  that we could see a new prime minister by the end of this year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move across the channel to France.  Protests erupting  over increased taxes on fuel, now what do these protests say about the  popularity of Macron's presidency?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Uh, well, I think -- you know, Emmanuel Macron's presidency has  been nothing short of disastrous, really.  He has an opinion poll rating at  around, sort of, 21 percentage points which is not exactly a vote of  confidence from the French people.  I think that Emmanuel Macron is seen as  deeply out of touch, as arrogant, as someone who doesn't understand the  concerns of ordinary French voters.  He's a politician, I think, he was  full of, sort of, you know, grand visionary ideas, that cannot understand,  you know, why his own voters don't -- you know, don't support him anymore.  </p><p>And this latest fuel tax which hits tens of millions of French drivers is  deeply unpopular, that's fueling the protests, but Emmanuel Macron, I  think, as somebody who really lives in a sort of another, you know,  political dimension, who dreams of creating a grand European Union Army  while his own people around from the streets protesting against his  leadership, so I think there's a lot of delusional thinking, actually, in  the Elysee Palace these days under Emmanuel Macron.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nile, this is a conversation I had over the weekend with  someone, that the socialists, the kind of new born American socialist that  we hear from quite often, they kind of preach that if we just tax the one  percent more, we can pay for all of these lovely things that Americans  need, but that is not what goes on in other nations, say, across Europe.   The people of these nations -- and I look at France, are taxed to their  teeth, in the form of gas taxes, you name -- value-added taxes.  It's not  just the one percent that's paying for if everything.  </p><p>And in fact, in this country, if you confiscated every single dollar that  the top one percent earned in adjusted growth income, it wouldn't be enough  money to pay for Medicare for all, it' would be two trillion versus 3.2.  trillion.  You would have to confiscate every dollar of adjusted growth  income from the top five percent and that would only pay for Medicare for  all and these protests kind of speak to that. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes, I think, you know, French people have had enough of, you  know, huge state taxes and, you know, France has been basically, sort of, a  big government, sort of, economic you know, basket case for successive  decades thanks to, you know, to high tax policies.  You know, hundreds of  thousands of French citizens have fled to London over the past decade  seeking jobs and opportunities in lower taxes, actually and so you've got  economic refugees leaving France heading to -- especially to the U.K. where  there's a lower tax regime and more free market policies.  </p><p>And basically, I think, increasing Europeans are rejecting socialist style  government -- and at the end of the day, Emmanuel Macron is a big  government thinker, he talks about, you know, free trade, he talks about  free markets.  But in reality, you know, France remains whetted to very  high levels of taxation, it has high levels of unemployment; Emmanuel  Macron is at heart a protectionist he's someone who calls Brexit a crime.   You know, this is a leader who, I think, is just deeply out of touch with,  you know, his own -- you know, his own people and I think is the reflection  of the huge economic problems that you see across big government high tax  European Union today.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, he -- obviously, Macron came into office promising the  opposite: A more dynamic economy.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  A more open economy in France, I guess it hasn't happened,  exactly.  </p><p>GARDINER:  That is not that -- that is not materialized at all.  And in  fact, I think, you know, Emmanuel Macron's big priority right now is a  creation of some sort of grand European Union super state.  So, he is  leader of the Euro Federalist in Europe and its latest plan calls to build  a European Union Army which he calls -- calls for to challenge the United  States.  And so, this is the mindset of the, of the French president right  now, completely delusional and out of touch with reality altogether.  And  so, it's hard to see how Emmanuel Macron is going to be re-elected in 2022  at this rate.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What are they using baguettes as spears and power of taxation to  frighten everyone?  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  Thank you so much, sir.   Great to see you, Nile Gardiner.</p><p>GARDINER:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.  Facebook fallout Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney  that is, will weigh in on how the Web site can make people depressed.   \"Saturday Night Live\" poking fun at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVE CARELL, ACTOR:  Hi everyone, as you know, Amazon just announced  location of its two new headquarters in New York and Virginia.  And  everyone, except for the people who live there and people who live in all  the places we didn't choose, is thrilled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More of Steve Carell.  We have to say thank you to Susan Li,  you'll catch her at the New York Stock Exchange all day.  She's working  hard, stay with us, Varney straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More fallout for Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg under fire over  his reactions to damaging reports about the company.  And now, a new study  also shows it can make you depressed.  Joining me now is the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  OK.  Actually, there is a new  study.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And it is objective.  It's from the University of Pennsylvania.   Now, this has got nothing to do with Facebook's data breaches or their, you  know, censorship of conservative opinion, this is something completely  separate.  This is getting used to this new thing, social networks.  Well,  the University of Pennsylvania studied I think 140, 150 undergraduates at  the college, and for some of them, half of them, they took away their  social network usage.  Then just limited to 10 minutes a day, that half of  the study, their mood all improved.  No more depression, no more, what --  less depression, less anxiety.  The other group which stayed with social  networks hours and hours and hours a day, no improvement in mood  whatsoever.  Apparently, this is the first cause and effect study that's  being recognized as Facebook can give you depression.</p><p>Now, this occur -- it occurs to me that, you know, younger person, you're  on Facebook, and you're scrolling through other people's lives, and all the  people's lives on Facebook are always wonderful, great boyfriend, great  girlfriend, fabulous family, new job, new house, wonderful vacation on the  beach, you got it all.  But what about you?  You look bad in comparison to  all of your friends and relatives who are looking so good on Facebook.  So  you get depressed because you're not enjoying life like they are.  And it's  a way -- we have to get used to this thing, it's not going to go away.   But, we have to get used to how to use it, and I don't think we're there  yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I stopped using Facebook, and even before that, Stuart, I lied  about virtually every bit of information I ever gave them.  I am actually  25 years of age according to Facebook whereabouts.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, and I'm 39.  You know, that's life, but I -- actually, I  don't use Facebook.  I don't do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You have other -- you're out cutting brush and doing things  outdoors, so I can't imagine you ever having time to like scroll through  recipes for ooey gooey butter cake on Facebook.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're absolutely right there, Dagen.  And no contest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just do not see that being your bag, Mr. Varney.</p><p>VARNEY:  Not me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not at all.  But doing T.V. is, and Stuart is coming up in about  10 minutes' time every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Stuart  Varney 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Thank you, Stuart, great to see you, my friend.</p><p>Coming up, a tale two of cities, why New York City's Mayor is backing  Amazon's decision to set up shop in the Big Apple, and the hand-outs and  perks Amazon got.  But no Wal-Mart.  Guess why, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Headquarter headache, Amazon facing fallout over its big move to  New York City from people all over the political spectrum.  Lauren  Simonetti has the latest.  Hey, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Dagen, didn't you  know that some big businesses are good and others are bad?  Well, at least  that's the rationale merging from New York City's winning bid for Amazon's  second headquarters or part of it.  Mayor Bill de Blasio bring up his  efforts to keep Wal-Mart out in response while on a local radio program on  Friday.  This is what he said, \"I was actively involved in the effort to  keep Wal-Mart out of New York City.  Wal-Mart is an entirely different  universe in terms of the systematic efforts they've taken to undermine  labor, small business, the environment, American workers, and obviously,  the politics of the Walton family.  Wal-Mart does not belong in New York  City.\"</p><p>Yes, he's rolling out the red carpet for Amazon, though, which also doesn't  support unions, which also kills off mom and pops, and hasn't put his money  where CEO Jeff Bezos' politics are or at least where the politics of his  newspaper at The Washington Post are.  Whereas this was interesting, I did  some research on this, Wal-Mart's Walton family has given money to  democratic politicians in the past including the Governor of New York  Andrew Cuomo.  But let's get back to basics, he was played by Steve Carell,  must-see T.V.  This was \"Saturday Night Live\" watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARELL:  Some folks have speculated that I was somehow trolling President  Trump by building one headquarters in his hometown of Queens, and the other  in his current residence of Washington D.C., thereby overshadowing or  humiliating them, but that's simply not true.  Sure, he attacked me  repeatedly on Twitter, but I chose our new locations because they were  ideal for growing business, not just to make Donald Trump think about how  I'm literally 100 times richer that he is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It was awesome.  I love the part where they put up all the  Twitter attacks.  You know, the SNL writers only knew the dog codenames  that he -- that the company gave for the 20 finalists competing for the  second quarters.  Crystal City, Virginia or Arlington (INAUDIBLE) New York  (INAUDIBLE) so the Amazon is very dog-friendly.  They basically gave each  of the cities a dog name for their codename.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But by -- can we go back to the de Blasio thing.  Because you  don't like -- you don't actually like the perks, the tax perks that New  York City got, but in terms of the politics, no company helps lower-income  Americans more than a Wal-Mart, and giving people easy access to very  inexpensive goods and groceries, so they are on par with Amazon.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, thank God -- thank goodness Mr. de Blasio is not running the  country.  This idea that I'm going to treat businesses differently because  I don't like the politics of their owners, this is -- this is the New York  Model, it's keep taxes very high, and no businesses would want to come  here, so then decide particular businesses that you like to give big  incentives to.  There, just lower rates for everybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mayor Pothole will never be President Pothole.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lauren Simonetti, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Freeman, Carter, thank you.</p><p>CARTER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's all about Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney.  Take it away, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, thank you so much.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p>We break it all down.  </p><p>Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p>The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p>In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p>In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p>Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p>But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p>But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p>And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p>And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p>Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p>Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p>And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p>And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p>And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p>So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p>So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p>So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p>Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p>And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p>So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p>Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p>But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p>Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p>I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p>And second of all -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p>I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p>But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p>And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p>LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p>LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p>LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p>LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p>They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p>But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p>I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p>CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p>And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p>So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p>LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p>But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p>LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p>And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p>But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p>CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p>These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p>Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p>LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.

When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p>So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p>LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p>I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>CARTER:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.

Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p>She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p>Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.

He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p>\"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p>In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p>Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p>One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p>CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p>CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p>So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p>Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p>LI:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p>We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p>Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p>A full roundup, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p>A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p>Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p>Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p>Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p>The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p>So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p>President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p>But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p>Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p>JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.

Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p>Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p>He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p>There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p>And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p>And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p>Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p>ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p>So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p>Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p>I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p>And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p>I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p>And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p>So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p>Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p>The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p>So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p>Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p>But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p>I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p>And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p>The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p>Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p>Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p>With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p>And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p>And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p>I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p>We'll tell you more.  </p><p>And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p>Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p>More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p>In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p>Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p>From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p>We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p>Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p>RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p>And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p>And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p>No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p>Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p>And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p>But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p>Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p>But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p>I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p>I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p>CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p>And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p>And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p>And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p>I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p>LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p>MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p>You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p>Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p>MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.

U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.

The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.

Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p>Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.   Though, she said she would like to get to call a couple of plates for  Browns, and open doors for women in coaching. </p><p>Watch this Formula 3 crash, at 171 miles per hour.  17-year-old German,  Sophia Floersch, fractured her spine, fractured a facial bone, suffered  concussion and other lacerations; 170 miles per hour at the Macau Grand  Prix in China.  She says, I'm fine but will go into surgery tomorrow.   NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series championship, Homestead, Miami, 12 laps to  go -- oh, well, this is actually before the race.  The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p>CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p>MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p>CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p>MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p>MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p>MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p>CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p>CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p>MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p>MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p>MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p>CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p>This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p>In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p>Asian markets finishing higher overnight.

The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p>And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p>And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p>Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p>But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p>So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p>Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p>And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p>He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p>And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p>LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p>LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p>And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p>But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p>How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p>Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p>And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p>So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p>So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p>So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p>So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p>And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p>Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p>We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p>John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p>Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p>Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p>And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p>And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p>LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p>Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p>FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p>But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p>Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p>LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p>But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p>And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p>CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p>LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p>CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p>LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p>CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p>LI:  You know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p>Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p>Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p>Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p>So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p>LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p>LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p>GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p>It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p>GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p>So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p>So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p>What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p>And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p>GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p>But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p>BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p>So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p>But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p>BASENESE:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p>Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p>But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p>BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p>LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p>Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p>BASENESE Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p>Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p>And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p>All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p>All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p>Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p>LI:  How did it start?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p>LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p>LI:  Offer some.  </p><p>CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p>LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p>I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p>C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p>I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p>CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, November 19th, Happy  Thanksgiving, a little early.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern,  markets under pressure this morning.  Futures are down across the board, an  83-point loss on the Dow futures.  This after a down week for all three  market gauges.  The Dow and NASDAQ both falling more than two percent last  week. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 hurt a little less, but was off more than 1-1/2 percent.  In  Europe, we do have gains to report in England and in France at the moment.   The DAX Index down ever so slightly.  But it was a winning start to the  week in Asia, all four major markets there to the plus side.  This despite  rising trade tensions with China.  Vice President Mike Pence back from the  Asia-Pacific Summit without an accord.  Now, the focus shifts to next  week's G20 Summit where President Trump is set to meet with China's  President Xi Jinping. </p><p>Trouble for Nissan, reports say that Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been  arrested for alleged financial violations in Japan.  The automaker holding  a news conference shortly where it is expected to announce Carlos Ghosn's  removal as chairman.  Devastation in California, crews searching for  victims of the deadly Camp Fire that has left at least 77 dead and nearly  unaccounted for.  We will have a live report from the ground in California. </p><p>Plus, Theresa May standing firm, why the British Prime Minister says that  ousting her will not make the U.K. exit from the European Union any easier.   And it's a cool idea, one company is going the extra mile to make sure its  coats are good fit.  Here to break it all down with me this morning, Fox  Business Network's Susan Li, along with Wall Street Journal Assistant  Editorial Page Editor James Freeman, and pollster and President of  Maslansky + Partners Lee Carter. </p><p>I was trying to get Lee to give the bath bomb young women a free advice -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Happy to do it.  Happy to do  it.  Just a short segment. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I know on air, no.  I'm just kidding.  So much to discuss.   I can't wake to talk about trade, Apple, Facebook.  We much to explore in  the next hour.  But let's move on to trade tensions flaring between the  world's two biggest economies just ahead of talk between President Trump  and China Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit.  Edward Lawrence is live from the  White House with more.  Good morning, Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   The world is watching this trade dispute at a meeting over the weekend at  the Asian-Pacific Cooperation Summit.  The leaders could not come up with a  statement in part because of the Chinese and U.S. positions respectively.   Now, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended that conference along with Vice  President Mike Pence.  Now, the vice president will be here at the White  House later on today to brief the president on exactly what happened there. </p><p>Well, Chinese media now reporting that their vice premier will not come to  Washington, D.C. this week.  He was supposed to lay the groundwork with  treasury officials for that bilateral meeting with President Xi and  President Donald Trump in Buenos Aires later on this month.  That meeting  will now happen between the ministers after the presidential meeting on  December 1st.  Now, last week, the Chinese sent a list to the U.S. of what  they would like to see changed in order to have a trade agreement between  the two countries. </p><p>The president on Friday saying this was a long list and some things not a  good list.  But, again, he says it's a start.  Now, talking with Chris  Wallace over the weekend, he says, his tone is what's given him this  presidential wins and a good economy including on trade. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Because you have people  coming at you so hard that if you don't fight back in a somewhat vigorous  way, you're not going to win. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And as that talk at the president has $267 billion more of  Chinese goods that he could possibly put under tariffs.  On Friday, the  president saying he's going to hold off on that.  We'll see what happens  out of this meeting between he and President Xi, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Edward.  Edward Lawrence for us at the White House.   Joining us now is House Judiciary Committee member Texas Congressman Louie  Gohmert.  Congressman, your take on this and the state of trade in our  relationship with China. </p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  Well, I know a lot of people are upset  that, oh, it appears to be breaking down.  But I recall, the best  negotiating that Reagan ever did was when Gorbachev said get rid of the  missile defense and you can have everything else you want, and he got up  and left the table.  It was the best thing he ever did.  It led to a great  deal for us and eventually to the demise of the Soviet Union.  We're not  looking for the demise of China. </p><p>But I know there are some senators that say, we need to pass a bill that  get rid of the tariffs or the ability the president threatened tariffs.  He  is a deal maker and you know when it's about business, it's good to have a  businessman.  I was told years ago by a U.S. trade rep, Louie, you got to  understand that we know we have the biggest economy in the world, so when  we make a trade deal that's better for other countries than us, it really  inures to our benefit. </p><p>Well, garbage.  We -- if it's better for them, it's better for them and we  got a guy that knows how to negotiate and uses leverage in this case  tariffs. </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you that  over in the Pacific after this APEC Summit, my sources are saying that it's  all been shaken up because I guess Asian tradition goes with process,  procedure, and what they know best, right?  So with this president shaking  things up, it's, you know, some people are calling this a new front, a new  cold war that is taking place between the U.S. and China, your thoughts? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, it's been pretty cool for a long time because China has  been stealing our goods, stealing our technology, so the war was going on.   It was just a one-sided -- </p><p>LI:  Would you call it a cold war though, is that how you would  characterize the relationship? </p><p>GOHMERT:  It's a little bit if not -- it's freezing.  It's tepid.  It's  always been because China is not out to see the United States end up doing  well.  So only to the extent that they get paid back the money we owe them,  so, yes.  It's -- maybe not a cold war but a cool war.  But it's still  doesn't mean you can't negotiate.  But you got to use leverage and I'm  thankful we got a president knows how to make deals. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James Freeman maybe frosty would be a good work.  Continue. </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I'm wondering how long it stays  frosty.  You seem, congressman, optimistic that there is going to be a deal  here.  Do you foresee it in the immediate term here or do you think this  goes on for a while? </p><p>GOHMERT:  It's completely up to the Chinese.  I see that we will eventually  get a deal because the Chinese they're not stupid.  They know that when  there is a tariff war usually neither side of the tariff war wins.  But the  president should not have the leverage removed.  It, you know, every time  he brings up tariffs, he usually has the backdoors.  Now, if you work out a  trade deal with us then we'll be able to forget about the tariffs. </p><p>So I think we will get that worked out and it will be to the United States'  benefit instead of continuing to make another deal that hurts us -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, how quickly -- how quickly can -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know.  Just really -- how quickly can you get the U.S.- Mexico-Canada deal approved?  </p><p>GOHMERT:  Oh, I think it will be approved very quickly, yes.  That's going  to be good better for us than NAFTA.  Napa, NAFTA.  I've got Napa on the  brain.  I feel sorry for those folks.  They've been through it.  But, you  know, I think we'll get it approve very quickly.  I don't think it will be  that big of a problem. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to the border, hundreds of Tijuana residents  protesting the arrival of thousands of migrants yesterday attempting to  enter the United States.  This comes as border wall construction will soon  begin in Southern Texas.  Congressman Gohmert, you represent the people of  Texas, your thoughts on this.  Do you get more border wall funding in the  budget?  What do you say? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I've said each of the last two weeks, we were in session in  September that, you know, the Trump voters will come out in 2020.  They've  seen the president do all he could.  But they haven't seen us try to help  the president really at all, and we ought to put money in.  If we don't put  money in for the president to build a wall before the election, there's a  good chance we'll lose the majority.  Nobody listened.  We lose majority. </p><p>The least we can do is get money in there now and I know that we're working  on that I've talked to people that we have elected in leadership positions  that are trying to make sure we get something done to help the president  with the border wall.  The best thing we can do for the people of Mexico  and Central America is get a wall, built where we need it, secure the  border, cut off the hundreds of billions of dollars that have flowed for  drugs, for human trafficking, for sex trafficking because once we cut that  off then the corruption in Mexico comes to a crawl and it becomes one of  the top 10 economies in the world. </p><p>It should have already been if we had nipped the drug cartels, but we  haven't done that.  This president is going to do it for you. </p><p>LEE:  So, congressman, we know that immigration was one of the number one  issues to voters out there.  There's been a lot of criticism since the  election saying that Republicans used the caravan in a scare tactic to sort  of stoke that and make immigration more important and hope that they, you  know, would get into office and then they dropped it ever since.  How do  you respond to that now as the caravan is getting closer and we've got this  right in front of us? </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I'm just grateful that, you know, alt-left and media like  CNN, MSNBC now realized, oh, there really are people.  It was not just an  election rouse.  These people have continued to come and they are a threat  to our sovereignty.  If we cannot enforce our borders then like Woodrow  Wilson did, when my least favorite president when he put 75,000 national  guard on the border after Pancho Villa came in and killed Americans.  I  mean this is something we've got to do. </p><p>There were seven -- over 70,000 Americans killed last year by the poison  that is being sold to us by the drug cartels.  This is important.  We got  to stop it.  We got to quit enriching the drug cartels and if we let these  folks in then there's just going to be wave after wave until we can kiss  the America we knew goodbye.  You have to have people that understand how  to keep a self-government and these folks don't know how to do that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Although Woodrow Wilson as a fellow Virginian, he's also behind  basically the arrival of the income tax in the United States, so that's  something to dislike about him as well. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Oh, he's my least favorite, yes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, thank you. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Thank you so much, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, no, I got one -- I'll move on to another topic,  Justice Department showdown President Trump addressing acting Attorney  General Matthew Whitaker's role and potentially limiting Special Counsel  Robert Mueller's probe during a Fox News interview yesterday.  Listen to  this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  It's going to be up to him.  I think he's very well aware  politically.  I think he's astute politically.  He's a very smart person.   A very respected person.  He's going do what's right.  I really believe  he's going to do what's right. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes  weighed in on what will happen to investigations over FISA abuse  allegations when the Democrats take over the House.  Here's what he told  Maria on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  We have three  buckets of information that we want declassified.  We now have a fourth  bucket that we want declassified.  The president has called for three of  those four to be declassified.  This begs an investigation by the  Department of Justice.  So either the Department of Justice under new  leadership can actually go in and investigate these cast of dirty cops is  really what they were and their connections to the Russians and their  connections to the Clinton campaign. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, your reaction to this and I just also want to point  out that John Roberts is reporting that the president will not be  submitting answers to Robert Mueller's team today, those written answers  they have been talked about, so your reaction to what you just heard. </p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, I've worked with some of the folks on the Intel Committee  and they're doing all they can.  The president got some bad advice and  pulling back from declassifying all of the material that was being sought.   That stuff needs to come out.  It -- and he was told that it takes -- it's  a long slow process.  People that know told me we could get it done in an  hour if we're allowed to do that.  And so, we have got to get this stuff  out.  But as far as Matt Whitaker, I mean Matt is a great guy. </p><p>He's a great American.  He should have protected his boss better from those  that work for Rosenstein that have been undermining him.  I went over and  told Jeff who is undermining him and what they're doing and went over and  talked to Matt, and they -- he did not protect his boss.  And now, he's in  his boss' job.  But let me -- let me say this real quick, Dagen, you know,  you picked a jury.  You're not entitled to jurors that it never had an  opinion. </p><p>What you're entitled to is somebody that will be fair going forward and  making appropriate determinations.  They're not entitled to a brain-dead  acting attorney general and Matt is doing fine.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, good to see you.  Congressman Louie Gohmert, we'll  see you soon.  </p><p>GOHMERT:  Good to see you, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come up -- coming up, Florida recount chaos, the details as  Republican Governor Rick Scott wins the Senate seat in the Sunshine State.   More ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Republican Rick Scott officially defeating Democrat Bill Nelson  in the Florida Senate race.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Hey, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Took a while.  That's true,  Dagen.  Incumbent Bill Nelson conceding in the Senate race to Governor Rick  Scott after a hand recount. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D-FL), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious in  this race.  But I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  We may have been heavily outspent in this this campaign, but we  were never outworked.  To all Floridians, whether you voted for me or for  my opponent, or that you didn't vote at all, I ask you to never give up  this fight. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Scott issuing a statement saying, \"I just spoke with Senator  Bill Nelson who graciously conceded and I thanked him for his years of  public service.\"  Scott's win gets Florida two Republican Senators for the  first time in more than a century.  Meanwhile, Florida embattled Broward  County election official Brenda Snipes has reportedly resigned following  heavy criticism over her handling of vote in the midterm election. </p><p>Well, Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested.  The automaker making  the announcement at a news conference in Tokyo just moments ago.  The  company is going to propose ousting Ghosn at a board meeting that's being  held on Thursday after they uncovered significant acts of misconduct.   Japanese media say that Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo after meeting with  prosecutors on suspicion that he falsified his financial reports including  allegedly under reporting his income by millions. </p><p>Nissan also confirming that board member Greg Kelly is also under arrest  this morning.  Ghosn rescued Nissan from their bankruptcy starting back at  1999.  He's also the chairman and chief executive which I should say of  Nissan's partner Renault.  French President Emanuel Macron says that France  wants to ensure stability at the auto alliance and they will protect those  workers at Renault.  Shares of Nissan we should are down nearly 10 percent  so far this year. </p><p>Well, Canada Goose wants customers to put a thousand dollar parkas to the  test against the harshest of conditions, so much another adding get this  frigid rooms to some stores.  You can test the high-end coat in  temperatures as low as negative 13.  The rooms even come with a wind-chill  button.  This is very interesting new approach as part of the company's  plan to increasingly sell directly to consumers instead of relying on  wholesalers like they have done in the past. </p><p>I think it's a great idea, Dagen, and you know what you're dealing with  before you get out there and catch pneumonia because your coat is not warm  enough. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a great idea buying -- never mind. </p><p>CASONE:  One thousand dollar coat.  I -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is the fur thing.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- there are a lot of other things on the planet that can keep  you warm without fur.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, a path of  destruction.  We have live to California as officials say the deadly  wildfire isn't even halfway finished burning yet.  Plus, a tale of two  cities, why New York City's mayor is backing Amazon's decision to setup  shop in the Big Apply but not Wal-Mart, guess why?  I think you can.  More  on the story straight ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Futures are pointing to a lower open this morning.  But there  are also lows of the morning so far 44-point loss on the Dow futures right  now as investors watch negotiations with China.  We do have some retail  earnings coming out this week.  I think investors will be looking for any  sign that the holiday shopping season is going to be a strong one as we get  close to a Thanksgiving and the kind of unofficial start of the shopping  season.  James, your thoughts on where markets are right now? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So we're not seeing a huge dip maybe a lot of trade concern  priced and a lot of negative expectations about this negotiations priced  in, and if our friend, Mr. Scaramucci is right and Mr. Gohmert is right,  and you actually get a quick resolution of this that would suggest there's  a lot of room to run for these markets.  </p><p>LI:  But one of the main drags right now in the premarket is Apple once  again which dipped into correction territory.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting that even more suppliers (INAUDIBLE) reducing their outlook for  the year because they don't expect as many orders to come from Apple in the  future.  So I guess the markets are lacking leadership and there are  concerns about economic growth going into next year which Goldman Sachs  says will only grow in the one percent area. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I worry about any infrastructure spending bill that the  Democrats and Republicans try to get done together given where our debt and  our deficits are right now, and what that could do to interest rates  because if you're worried about interest rates here, you're going to be  biting your fingernails when the 10-year yield is at three and a half  percent -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- four percent. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Maybe in terms of if you're hoping for some pro-growth  legislation to come out next year, maybe there's an immigration deal where  you can allow more legal immigration.  I think that would be the only hope. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to the devastation in California.  A pair of  wildfires leaving at least 80 people dead, nearly 1,000 people are still  unaccounted for.  Jonathan Hunt has the latest in Malibu, California.   Jonathan? </p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, good morning to you.   The flames are no longer the issue either in and around the Camp Fire in  Northern California nor in the Woolsey Fire down here in Southern  California.  The fires are under control.  But the big concern now  particularly around the Camp Fire up in the north is the ongoing search for  bodies.  As you mentioned, there are still close to 1,000 people listed as  unaccounted for and teams have been going through what remains of the town  of Paradise desperately trying to search for any human remains that may  help them identify some of the missing. </p><p>It's a race against time because rain is coming in the next 24 to 36 hours.   And when you're talking about properties that have been burned to tiny  pieces of ash finding human remains is difficult enough.  If the rains come  in and wash a lot of those ashes away, it will become even more difficult.   Meantime though, there was a vigil held near Paradise, California for those  who survived the deadly fires.  That was held last night.  A lot of people  showing up simply because they wanted to be in the presence of other  survivors.  Listen here. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARRIE LYNN, PARADISE RESIDENT:  I just know that God is comforting us as  far as imagine and we're living in.  It's really -- and then I look around  at all the kindness. </p><p>JOE FLORENCE, PARADISE RESIDENT:  My wife is -- she needs some closure.  To  be around other people that have gone through the same thing that we have,  it helps with the grieving process. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HUNT:  Here in Southern California, in Malibu in particular, many residents  are being allowed back in.  Although, a lot of them are finding this.  You  can see behind me that they have pretty much nothing left.  Also concerns  about rain coming here this week.  Dagen, you can't see to my right in this  dark, but we're beneath the Santa Monica Mountains.  When you get these  fires, it burns away all the brush, all the trees.  That essentially means  there's no anchors for the topsoil on there. </p><p>You get the rains.  We get mudslides.  We saw it last year after the big  fires in Santa Barbara followed by deadly mudslides.  That is now the fear  here in Malibu, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jonathan, thank you for all your reporting.  Jonathan Hunt in  Malibu for us.  </p><p>HUNT:  Sure. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, battle over Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May now  issuing a stark warning to opponents threatening to unseat her.  Former  foreign policy adviser former under Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is  weighing in on those negotiations.  That is next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo, it's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure to start this shortened holiday week, Futures lower across  the board; 52-point loss on the Dow Futures right now after a losing week  for all three major market gauges last week.  In Europe, some mixed market  action we have right now, all of the markets there are up but FTSE and the  CAC in France have been toggling back-and-forth between negative and  positive, but green across the board right now.  </p><p>This as British Prime Minister Theresa May assures Britain that ousting her  will not make Britain's exit from the European Union any easier.  And then  we move on to protests in France, the newest problem facing President  Emmanuel Macron that has the French taking to the streets.  Asian markets  finishing higher overnight; gains across the board on all four major  markets there.</p><p>Facebook, under more fire.  First details on why CEO Mark Zuckerberg  reportedly has the company on red alert, then a report on why cutting back  on the social media site is good for your mental health.  And then,  Amazon's big move from super secrecy during the headquartered two selection  process to hot shots from \"Saturday Night Live\" over weekend.  That and  more, the latest from the online retailer. </p><p>To our top story this half-hour.  Moving the plan forward, British Prime  Minister Theresa May is selling agreement for great Britain's exit from the  European Union.  The British leader citing her deal's tough measures on  immigration is one of its strengths; May re-enforcing her resolve to see  this through to the end earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  My job is to get the best deal.   Parliament must then examine it and do what is in national interest.  We  have in view a deal that will work for the U.K. and let no one be in any  doubt, I am determined to deliver it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here now, Director of the Thatcher Center for Freedom at the  Heritage Foundation, Nile Gardiner.  Now, your reaction to Theresa May's  comments and her handling of the Brexit.  </p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF THE THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM AT THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Well, good morning.  I have to say that Theresa May's handling  of the Brexit negotiations have been absolutely disastrous.  In effect,  it's really been a surrender to the European Union.  And the proposal that  she has put forward is completely unacceptable.  It, basically, makes  Britain subservient to the European Union; it does not take Britain outside  of the E.U. Customs Union, the U.K. will not able to sign free trade  agreements including with the United States.  So, this is a deal that does  not restore British sovereignty and self-determination and freedom to the  British people.  </p><p>So, Theresa May, I think, has not lived up to the promises she made to the  British people earlier.  And in many ways, and this is an appalling weak- kneed deal offered by the British prime minister, which is being heavily  opposed by a large number of MPs within her party and she's faced a wave of  resignations, there'll be more resignations to come.  She could indeed face  a vote of \"no\" confidence later this week, if enough conservative MPs come  forward to call for such a vote.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Nile, James Freeman here with the Wall Street Journal.  It sounds  like you're more in camp of wanting what we call hard Brexit, do you feel  like there would be an opportunity for the U.K. out of the E.U. to do a  trade deal, perhaps join our new NAFTA-USMCA, perhaps other moves.  Can you  give us your forecast for if Britain leaves the E.U. completely?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, Brexit definitely taking place on March 29, 2019.  It's a  matter of what kind of Brexit it is.  And the British people in 2016 voted  in huge number: 17.4 million Britons voted to leave the European Union;  they understood that they were leaving the single market and customs union  when they voted.  That was the key message from the voted leave campaign,  the official campaign to vote to leave the European Union.  </p><p>And so, the British people want to see their sovereignty restored.  Theresa  May's deal does not deliver that; it's far better, I think, for Britain to  -- either renegotiate this new May proposal or seek a \"no\" deal Brexit  where Britain trades with the rest of the world under WTO terms also trades  with E.U. under WTO terms.  It would be far preferable, I think, to what  Theresa May is offering which is a deal that shackles Britain indefinitely  to the European Union, that's not what British people voted for.  </p><p>CARTER:  Is there anyone -- I'm curious, because it was so divided when  Brexit was voted on and there were so many people who wanted to say, is  there anyone right now who looks at this deal and says, I'm happy that  we're not doing a hard exit -- is there any of the constituents here who  said this is, this is what we should be doing?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, certainly there are, you know, some supporters of Theresa  May within the conservative party.  There are also, I think, big business  interests who have backed the Theresa May proposal.  There are also many  business leaders who oppose this deal as well.  So, certainly, there has  been a mixed reaction to this, but if you look at the public opinion polls,  there is less than 20 percent support for the Theresa May deal right now.   It's deeply unpopular.  There's a lack of trust in the prime minister and  she's no Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May, that's for sure.  </p><p>Margaret Thatcher would've negotiated a tough deal in the British national  interests.  In addition, Theresa May has pledged to hand over 39 billion  pounds to European Union for nothing in return.  I think the, you know, the  British have been treated with utter, you know, disdain and contempt by  European Union, and this is a sheer blackmail from the E.U. here and should  not give in to these demands.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So, it sounds like you're not a Theresa May fan, is  that fair to characterize you that way?  Does she need to go?  </p><p>GARDINER:  I have to say, she's been hugely disappointing and I think if  she faces a vote of \"no\" confidence, there's a very good chance, I think,  that we could see a new prime minister by the end of this year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move across the channel to France.  Protests erupting  over increased taxes on fuel, now what do these protests say about the  popularity of Macron's presidency?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Uh, well, I think -- you know, Emmanuel Macron's presidency has  been nothing short of disastrous, really.  He has an opinion poll rating at  around, sort of, 21 percentage points which is not exactly a vote of  confidence from the French people.  I think that Emmanuel Macron is seen as  deeply out of touch, as arrogant, as someone who doesn't understand the  concerns of ordinary French voters.  He's a politician, I think, he was  full of, sort of, you know, grand visionary ideas, that cannot understand,  you know, why his own voters don't -- you know, don't support him anymore.  </p><p>And this latest fuel tax which hits tens of millions of French drivers is  deeply unpopular, that's fueling the protests, but Emmanuel Macron, I  think, as somebody who really lives in a sort of another, you know,  political dimension, who dreams of creating a grand European Union Army  while his own people around from the streets protesting against his  leadership, so I think there's a lot of delusional thinking, actually, in  the Elysee Palace these days under Emmanuel Macron.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nile, this is a conversation I had over the weekend with  someone, that the socialists, the kind of new born American socialist that  we hear from quite often, they kind of preach that if we just tax the one  percent more, we can pay for all of these lovely things that Americans  need, but that is not what goes on in other nations, say, across Europe.   The people of these nations -- and I look at France, are taxed to their  teeth, in the form of gas taxes, you name -- value-added taxes.  It's not  just the one percent that's paying for if everything.  </p><p>And in fact, in this country, if you confiscated every single dollar that  the top one percent earned in adjusted growth income, it wouldn't be enough  money to pay for Medicare for all, it' would be two trillion versus 3.2.  trillion.  You would have to confiscate every dollar of adjusted growth  income from the top five percent and that would only pay for Medicare for  all and these protests kind of speak to that. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes, I think, you know, French people have had enough of, you  know, huge state taxes and, you know, France has been basically, sort of, a  big government, sort of, economic you know, basket case for successive  decades thanks to, you know, to high tax policies.  You know, hundreds of  thousands of French citizens have fled to London over the past decade  seeking jobs and opportunities in lower taxes, actually and so you've got  economic refugees leaving France heading to -- especially to the U.K. where  there's a lower tax regime and more free market policies.  </p><p>And basically, I think, increasing Europeans are rejecting socialist style  government -- and at the end of the day, Emmanuel Macron is a big  government thinker, he talks about, you know, free trade, he talks about  free markets.  But in reality, you know, France remains whetted to very  high levels of taxation, it has high levels of unemployment; Emmanuel  Macron is at heart a protectionist he's someone who calls Brexit a crime.   You know, this is a leader who, I think, is just deeply out of touch with,  you know, his own -- you know, his own people and I think is the reflection  of the huge economic problems that you see across big government high tax  European Union today.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, he -- obviously, Macron came into office promising the  opposite: A more dynamic economy.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  A more open economy in France, I guess it hasn't happened,  exactly.  </p><p>GARDINER:  That is not that -- that is not materialized at all.  And in  fact, I think, you know, Emmanuel Macron's big priority right now is a  creation of some sort of grand European Union super state.  So, he is  leader of the Euro Federalist in Europe and its latest plan calls to build  a European Union Army which he calls -- calls for to challenge the United  States.  And so, this is the mindset of the, of the French president right  now, completely delusional and out of touch with reality altogether.  And  so, it's hard to see how Emmanuel Macron is going to be re-elected in 2022  at this rate.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What are they using baguettes as spears and power of taxation to  frighten everyone?  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  Thank you so much, sir.   Great to see you, Nile Gardiner.</p><p>GARDINER:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.  Facebook fallout Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney  that is, will weigh in on how the Web site can make people depressed.   \"Saturday Night Live\" poking fun at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVE CARELL, ACTOR:  Hi everyone, as you know, Amazon just announced  location of its two new headquarters in New York and Virginia.  And  everyone, except for the people who live there and people who live in all  the places we didn't choose, is thrilled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More of Steve Carell.  We have to say thank you to Susan Li,  you'll catch her at the New York Stock Exchange all day.  She's working  hard, stay with us, Varney straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More fallout for Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg under fire over  his reactions to damaging reports about the company.  And now, a new study  also shows it can make you depressed.  Joining me now is the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  OK.  Actually, there is a new  study.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And it is objective.  It's from the University of Pennsylvania.   Now, this has got nothing to do with Facebook's data breaches or their, you  know, censorship of conservative opinion, this is something completely  separate.  This is getting used to this new thing, social networks.  Well,  the University of Pennsylvania studied I think 140, 150 undergraduates at  the college, and for some of them, half of them, they took away their  social network usage.  Then just limited to 10 minutes a day, that half of  the study, their mood all improved.  No more depression, no more, what --  less depression, less anxiety.  The other group which stayed with social  networks hours and hours and hours a day, no improvement in mood  whatsoever.  Apparently, this is the first cause and effect study that's  being recognized as Facebook can give you depression.</p><p>Now, this occur -- it occurs to me that, you know, younger person, you're  on Facebook, and you're scrolling through other people's lives, and all the  people's lives on Facebook are always wonderful, great boyfriend, great  girlfriend, fabulous family, new job, new house, wonderful vacation on the  beach, you got it all.  But what about you?  You look bad in comparison to  all of your friends and relatives who are looking so good on Facebook.  So  you get depressed because you're not enjoying life like they are.  And it's  a way -- we have to get used to this thing, it's not going to go away.   But, we have to get used to how to use it, and I don't think we're there  yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I stopped using Facebook, and even before that, Stuart, I lied  about virtually every bit of information I ever gave them.  I am actually  25 years of age according to Facebook whereabouts.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, and I'm 39.  You know, that's life, but I -- actually, I  don't use Facebook.  I don't do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You have other -- you're out cutting brush and doing things  outdoors, so I can't imagine you ever having time to like scroll through  recipes for ooey gooey butter cake on Facebook.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're absolutely right there, Dagen.  And no contest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just do not see that being your bag, Mr. Varney.</p><p>VARNEY:  Not me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not at all.  But doing T.V. is, and Stuart is coming up in about  10 minutes' time every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Stuart  Varney 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Thank you, Stuart, great to see you, my friend.</p><p>Coming up, a tale two of cities, why New York City's Mayor is backing  Amazon's decision to set up shop in the Big Apple, and the hand-outs and  perks Amazon got.  But no Wal-Mart.  Guess why, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Headquarter headache, Amazon facing fallout over its big move to  New York City from people all over the political spectrum.  Lauren  Simonetti has the latest.  Hey, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Dagen, didn't you  know that some big businesses are good and others are bad?  Well, at least  that's the rationale merging from New York City's winning bid for Amazon's  second headquarters or part of it.  Mayor Bill de Blasio bring up his  efforts to keep Wal-Mart out in response while on a local radio program on  Friday.  This is what he said, \"I was actively involved in the effort to  keep Wal-Mart out of New York City.  Wal-Mart is an entirely different  universe in terms of the systematic efforts they've taken to undermine  labor, small business, the environment, American workers, and obviously,  the politics of the Walton family.  Wal-Mart does not belong in New York  City.\"</p><p>Yes, he's rolling out the red carpet for Amazon, though, which also doesn't  support unions, which also kills off mom and pops, and hasn't put his money  where CEO Jeff Bezos' politics are or at least where the politics of his  newspaper at The Washington Post are.  Whereas this was interesting, I did  some research on this, Wal-Mart's Walton family has given money to  democratic politicians in the past including the Governor of New York  Andrew Cuomo.  But let's get back to basics, he was played by Steve Carell,  must-see T.V.  This was \"Saturday Night Live\" watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARELL:  Some folks have speculated that I was somehow trolling President  Trump by building one headquarters in his hometown of Queens, and the other  in his current residence of Washington D.C., thereby overshadowing or  humiliating them, but that's simply not true.  Sure, he attacked me  repeatedly on Twitter, but I chose our new locations because they were  ideal for growing business, not just to make Donald Trump think about how  I'm literally 100 times richer that he is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It was awesome.  I love the part where they put up all the  Twitter attacks.  You know, the SNL writers only knew the dog codenames  that he -- that the company gave for the 20 finalists competing for the  second quarters.  Crystal City, Virginia or Arlington (INAUDIBLE) New York  (INAUDIBLE) so the Amazon is very dog-friendly.  They basically gave each  of the cities a dog name for their codename.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But by -- can we go back to the de Blasio thing.  Because you  don't like -- you don't actually like the perks, the tax perks that New  York City got, but in terms of the politics, no company helps lower-income  Americans more than a Wal-Mart, and giving people easy access to very  inexpensive goods and groceries, so they are on par with Amazon.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, thank God -- thank goodness Mr. de Blasio is not running the  country.  This idea that I'm going to treat businesses differently because  I don't like the politics of their owners, this is -- this is the New York  Model, it's keep taxes very high, and no businesses would want to come  here, so then decide particular businesses that you like to give big  incentives to.  There, just lower rates for everybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mayor Pothole will never be President Pothole.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lauren Simonetti, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Freeman, Carter, thank you.</p><p>CARTER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's all about Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney.  Take it away, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, thank you so much.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p> We break it all down.  </p><p> Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p> The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p> In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p> In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p> Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p> Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p> But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p> But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p> And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p> And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p> Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p> Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p> And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p> And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p> And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p> So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p> So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p> So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p> Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p> And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p> So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p> Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p> But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p> Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p> I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p> And second of all -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p> I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p> But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p> And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p> LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p> LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p> LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p> LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p> FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p> LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p> They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p> But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p> I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p> CARTER:  Right.  </p><p> LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p> CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p> And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p> So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p> LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p> But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p> LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p> And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p> But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p> CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p> LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p> These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p> Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p> LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p> LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.  These are some of the names I've  downgraded now.  </p><p> Their revenue forecast for the year because they're not expecting as many  orders coming from Apple, and this isn't first time that Apple's had  problems with launching a new handset.  </p><p> Remember, the iPhone 5c, do you remember?  The cheaper iPhone that they  launched five years ago.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> LI:  A month later, they also cut become on their orders as well because it  wasn't selling as well.</p><p> I think it's a -- it's a reality that there's saturation in the market.   People have the Apples and the handsets that they need.  </p><p> Can you keep selling 200 million plus each and every year?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then that separate chipmaker, the graphics chipmaker,  NVIDIA, it entered a bear market almost in one day.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Has -- it was down 19 percent.</p><p> LI:  But they've had that track record, up crash, up crash over the last  ten years.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They have.  </p><p> I want to move on to American and Chinese trade tensions boiling over at  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  </p><p> China reportedly upset of the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly  singling out their trade practices.</p><p> This was the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in  which the parties did not issue a communique.  James, your reaction to  this.</p><p> How much should we read into this issue?  Again, it made the front page of  \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Oh, boy.  \"Summit Breaks Amid Trade Tensions.\"</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p> So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p> LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p> I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p> CARTER:  For sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.  The final Florida  Election results are in.  Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p> Good morning, Griff.</p><p> GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p> You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p> She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p> Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  A public office is a public trust.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JENKINS:  That public trust now in the hands of Senator-elect Rick Scott.   He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p> \"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p> In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p> Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p> One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p> CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p> CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p> CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p> So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p> So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p> CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p> Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p> LI:  There you go.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p> Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p> We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p> Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p> A full roundup, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p> A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p> Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p> Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p> Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p> The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p> So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p> President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p> Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p> But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p> Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p> JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.  It has to be you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald brought in  $16 million, but that makes it the lowest total ever for an opening weekend  in the Harry Potter franchise.  </p><p> These movies were spinoff of Harry Potter and it was filmed with 16 percent  below their 2016 opening weekend, the first version of this one.</p><p> Last week's box office winner, Doctor Seuss' The Grinch brought in just  over $38 million.  </p><p> And rounding up the top five, Bohemian Rhapsody, that's the Queen movie.   New release, Instant Family, and Widows rounding out your numbers, Dagen,  and those are your headlines.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p> LI:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p> LI:  Thank you.</p><p> Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p> Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p> He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p> There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p> And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p> And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p> Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p> ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p> So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p> KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p> Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p> JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p> I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p> And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p> I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p> And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p> So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p> FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p> Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p> The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p> So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p> Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p> But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p> I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p> And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p> The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p> Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p> Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p> With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p> And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p> And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p> I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p> HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p> We'll tell you more.  </p><p> And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p> Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p> More ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p> In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p> Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p> From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p> We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p> To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p> Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p> RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p> And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p> And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p> No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p> Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p> And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p> FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p> But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p> Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p> MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p> But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p> I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p> I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p> So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p> CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p> And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p> MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p> And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p> And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p> I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p> LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p> MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p> LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p> MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p> You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p> Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p> MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p> MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.

Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, Dagen.  King Salman bin Abdulaziz, is giving his first public  address since the killing of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi,  after embarking on a nationwide tour with his son, the Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman.  U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.  I know  exactly, I know everything that went on where that happened -- </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, the crowned prince has continuously denied his involvement  in Khashoggi's murder.  </p><p> Well, General Electric reportedly facing a dilemma in Iraq, as the company  seeks power sales.  The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.  The report advises G.E. to distance himself  from at least one of its contracts there.  G.E. is competing with Germany's  Siemens for multi-billion-dollar new power contracts throughout that  country.  Shares of G.E. are lower in the pre-market, a quarter of a  percent right now.  </p><p> Well YouTube is now streaming full length movies for free.  But, of course,  there's a catch because nothing is free, right?  To enjoy them, you've got  to endure advertisements that support the movie.  But if you are willing to  pay to be a YouTube premium subscriber the ads go away.  Movies so far  include \"Rocky,\" \"Zookeeper,\" and \"Legally Blonde\" among other.  Shares of  Google parent company, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, up about one percent  so far this year, Dagen.  And there you go, another way to stream content.   Like number 50.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I hooked my dad with streaming his ACC games or his  University of Virginia games.</p><p> CASONE:  Nice, that's important.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a -- that was a long row, so to speak.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, the teaching moments with our parents can be interesting  sometimes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, dreams of Coach Condi; why  Condoleezza Rice says that she will not be coaching Cleveland Browns.  More  sports, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A lot of drama in NFL yesterday.  Jared Max is here with all of  your sports highlights.  Hey, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  There were  three walk off wins on last second field goals by the Broncos, the Cowboys  and the Raiders.  Last minute comeback went for the Steelers -- how about  the Vikings last night?  First place, Bears were up 14-0.  They were  leading 14-6 when Chicago's Eddy Jackson intercepted Kirk Cousins, brought  it in for a touchdown.  Chicago led 20-6, now, the bear were leading 25-20.   Two minutes to go, Minnesota after a touchdown tries an onside kick, but  the Bears recovering.  Chicago wins, now 7-3 way to off the NFC north.  </p><p> 33 years to the day since legendary Washington Redskins Quarterback Joe  Theismann suffered a career-ending injury -- he was at the Skins' game  Sunday, where the team's current quarterback, Alex Smith suffered identical  injuries that Theismann did.  Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p> Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.   Though, she said she would like to get to call a couple of plates for  Browns, and open doors for women in coaching. </p><p> Watch this Formula 3 crash, at 171 miles per hour.  17-year-old German,  Sophia Floersch, fractured her spine, fractured a facial bone, suffered  concussion and other lacerations; 170 miles per hour at the Macau Grand  Prix in China.  She says, I'm fine but will go into surgery tomorrow.   NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series championship, Homestead, Miami, 12 laps to  go -- oh, well, this is actually before the race.  The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p> MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p> CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p> MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p> MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p> CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p> MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p> MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p> MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p> CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p> MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p> CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p> MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p> MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p> MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p> CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to  the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.</p><p> This after a week of red for all your major market indicators.  Dow and  Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week.  The S&amp;P down 1.6 percent.</p><p> In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session.  But now  the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.</p><p> Asian markets finishing higher overnight.  All four major markets there to  the plus side.</p><p> Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has  been arrested for alleged financial violations.  The automaker looking to  remove him as chairman.</p><p> And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation  but he says it is coming anyway.  The tech giant already struggling with  orders for its new iPhones.  Suppliers are paying the price.  We break down  all of that for you.</p><p> And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of  the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than  a year.</p><p> Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with \"Wall Street  Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and  Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter.  Welcome, one and all.  What's  on your mind?  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese  government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we  shouldn't have unfair trade practices.  We've seen how in the past they've  refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft.  Now they're not even  willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair  trading relationship.  Very bizarre.</p><p> But maybe it's just setting the table.  Maybe this is art of the deal and  then they'll be more reasonable later.  I don't know.</p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  But I'm scare when you're  using the term \"cold war\".  This is a new cold war and it's been opened in  2018.  And they're calling chaos at APEC.  I mean they've never seen this  before.  And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the  countries.</p><p> So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking  up.  And we'll see how it works.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting  like everyone gets along and essentially lying?  Like oh, we love each  other.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Isn't that what diplomacy is?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world  what's really going on.  </p><p> CARTER:  Right.  I think it's really fascinating too that people are  willing to be patient with this process.  Like I've been having some  conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we  do.  They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know,  it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now.  And I think  that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony  Scaramucci on deck.</p><p> LI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's raring to go.</p><p>American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about  this.  Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  Summit.  China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as  unfairly singling out their trade practices.  This is the first time in the  summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.</p><p> Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital  founder, author of \"The Blue Collar President\" -- Anthony Scaramucci -- </p><p> ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Practicing my APEC wave  here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- no.  If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the  -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb.  There you go.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Good, good.  I need shoulder surgery.  But go ahead.  I'm  sorry.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Your reaction -- China, the United States.  Where do we go from  here in terms of the trade relationship?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  So I'm going to say something outrageous.  I actually think  that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly.  And if it's not next  week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's  personality.</p><p> And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the  concessions that were made that were minor concessions.  And so this has  typically been the President's style.</p><p> He is very rough in the beginning.  He comes out guns a-blazing.  He's  boxing away.  If you read \"The Art of the Deal\", that's exactly what he  does.  And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the  negotiation.</p><p> And so here's another thing for the President.  I know his personality well  enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January  because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his  administration that he's tied up these trade deals.  And then he'll want to  work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.  </p><p> LI:  So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Were you doing this?</p><p> LI:  Well, you know, working on it, at great risk.  Great risk -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LI:  -- because of it.  But basically from my sources in Asia, they said  that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to  Papua New Guinea.  So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by  not showing respect.  </p><p> And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least  you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't  you?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean -- you know, that could be.  I think it's a  combination of different things.  Just the unbelievable schedule that he  had leading up into the midterms.  I think that they probably held him back  from going to Asia.</p><p> But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting  anybody.  I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP  situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be  concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think  the trade deal gets done.  But I don't think anybody should be upset that  he didn't make it to APEC.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Ok.  So we've talked a lot about the President's time line.  And  this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent  fight with the Chinese in your view.  That he's looking to wrap it up.</p><p> How about on the Chinese side?  There's this sense that China thinks in  decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to  deal as well.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I absolutely think that.  If you know where their market is  Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things  are true.  And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the  western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.  </p><p> Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst  and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the  capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never  wrote down those assets after 2008.</p><p> And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the  Chinese government.  It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop  up those banks.  And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you  see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a  danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place  throughout China.</p><p> So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the  President likes -- I think both presidents like each other.  So my guess is  this thing will get done.  If not next week, shortly thereafter.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz  Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox.  So listen to this.  I want to get your  reaction. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  The Democrats right now are  focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat.  I think the  real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style  economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen  coming in are advocating.</p><p> So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.  And  Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which  means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party.   That's not good for the country.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the  speakership.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  As many votes as she needs.  As many votes as she needs.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud.  Because it -- it  seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she  may need the votes.  And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.</p><p> So they can say whatever they want.  And they can posture any way that they  want.  She's an absolutely ruthless killer.  I say that in the most  complementary, most admirable way.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not literally.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  No, I'm saying metaphorically.  But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE)  in.  She's definitely going to be the House Speaker.  So -- and by the way,  I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.  </p><p> So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are  being sharpened metaphorically.  And she is going to be the House Speaker.   So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or  you'd rather not?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or  anywhere else in the country.  And ultimately she is one of the greatest  fundraisers in modern Democratic history.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit  for the midterm elections.  She raised a ton of money and she mobilized  people in the right areas.</p><p> And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave.  It wasn't a  blue ripple.  If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state  legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue  ripple.</p><p> Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been  way worse.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this -- speaking of the President.  He was  sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday.  So  listen to this, Anthony, and then react.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like her a lot.  I respect  her a lot.  She's very smart.  I want her to get much tougher and we'll see  what happens there.</p><p> We get along well.  There are certain things I love what he does and there  are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his  strength (ph).</p><p> John at some point is going to want to move on.  John will move on.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  When will John Kelly move on?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Look at me.  It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right.   But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot  like George Steinbrenner.  So all of us that are aficionados of sports  going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens,  that's like incoming, take cover.  You follow what I'm saying.</p><p> Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him.  But he  said that with, you know, the attorney general.  And he has said that on  many different occasions.  And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough  for him to say let's see what happens, ok.  I was gone before he could say  let's see what happens.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Who's going to be the next attorney general?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I mean hope it's Chris Christie.  You know, I  think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial.  And I  see, you know, there's some -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just made a face.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot.  I mean -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's  father.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I got it.  I think they've moved past that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris.  And so I would  like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he  would also run the department properly.  </p><p> CARTER:  There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with  all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves.  Do you think all of  this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening?  Or  are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things  up?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an  entrepreneur.  He's been an entrepreneur his whole life.  If you study  entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship,  there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're  getting started in a situation.</p><p> Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can  pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning  until they get the team right.  </p><p> And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if  you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders.  If you're a golf guy, you  hire golf course builders.  He thought ok, I going into the government, I  hire government builders.</p><p> And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very  loyal to him or his agenda.  And so now he's got to shift the deck and  reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.  </p><p> LI:  So who's going to be the chief of staff?  A budget guy?  Do you think  it will be Mick Mulvaney?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I think he would be great.   Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff.   I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.</p><p> Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of  death for both of them.  They're probably going to call me later and say  stop talking about me on TV.  You know, I don't know but I like both those  guys.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I mean your experience, I understand -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  PhD.</p><p> FREEMAN:  PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days.   But -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk  -- Jim.  But, you know -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things  there.  I mean -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't think this is a given.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Name one good thing that he's done.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, for example -- </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Name one.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos  has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has  gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax  cut.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I would say both of them.  But I would say Kelly deserves some  credit here as the chief of staff.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really  comes out, ok.  I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I.  So we're  going to see -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I did.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  -- the aftermath of this whole thing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  Because I want to -- that's the narrative.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  He hasn't been fair to the President.  I mean just read what  he talks about -- read what he says about the President.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a  minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office.   And I think that people who know the President push back on that.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I pushed back on that very hard, ok.  And I don't even care  that John fired me.  That's ridiculous.  That won't be the last time I've  been fired.  It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok.  I'm a bit  of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.</p><p> But here's the bottom line, ok.  He hurt the morale inside the White House,  ok.  And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality  and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the  President.</p><p> Forget about me.  Let's say that I wasn't.  but I'm just talking about  other people inside the White House.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff? </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  They're playing the music, brother.  See that?  I'm going to  get out of here.  We're going to get through a commercial break.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?  </p><p> LI:  Make a twist, more wrist action.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I just want to make sure.  Ok.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Holding back.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest.  More when we come back.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on this developing story -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  And we're  hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.</p><p> But first to this news.  Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal  investigation found significant acts of misconduct.  Japanese media  reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion  that he falsified his financial reports.</p><p>Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also  arrested.  Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company  from near bankruptcy.  He is also chairman and chief executive of France's  Renault.  Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their  records clean of complaints by customers and employers.  According to a new  study in the \"Wall Street Journal\", employees which found the practice  makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of  brokers.  Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates  the brokerages.  FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder  for brokers to purge those records.</p><p>Ok.  There is this.  Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a  record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University.   It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school.  The money can allow  students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p> Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more  generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.  </p><p> And those are your headlines.  A lot of cash -- Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put  it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are  beneath him.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, pretty much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He has to socialize with billionaires.  </p><p> CASONE:  Millionaire whatever.  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This is money well spent.  Running for  president, maybe not so much.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think he's going to look at that and find that there's  not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and  social liberalism.  </p><p> LI:  And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the  Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on  sugary sodas.  He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through  things like that.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on  gun control issues.  And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some  ways.  He knows how to balance a budget.  But that means taking things away  from people.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an  independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go.  But I just -- I  don't see it.  </p><p> CARTER:  I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him  as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology.  So I  don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not  necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.  </p><p> LI:  Or a running mate potentially?  </p><p> CARTER:  An interesting idea, for sure.  </p><p> LI:  You know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the  Iowa State Fair.  That's all I have to say.</p><p> Coming up -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Always good advice.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians  sometimes.</p><p> Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war  over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.</p><p> Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales.  Why strong  corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors'  spirits.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at futures.  They're pointing to a lower open  on Wall Street with technology on the decline.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with  slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.</p><p> Joining me now, S&amp;P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin  Gibbs.  Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come  back to technology stocks?  </p><p> ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P:  No, we've  been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks.   There's been a change in leadership.</p><p> Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced  growth stocks.  And part of that is because technology is actually going to  have massively slowing growth next year.  They're actually going to have  below average earnings growth versus the broader market.</p><p> So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to  look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from  as well as better valuations.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit  all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and  Procter &amp; Gamble.  </p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's where the money was.  </p><p> LI:  And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman  bought a stake recently.  But I was really a little shocked by reading the  Goldman Sachs report this weekend.  They're predicting GDP to be 3.5  percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005.  Next year  in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year  this year.  But it's really tough to keep up that pace.  And we're even  seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit  growth this year and 8 percent next year.  And so it's just harder and  harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.  </p><p> LI:  But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?  </p><p> GIBBS:  Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past  month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people  start looking at 2019.  It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh,  wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year.  There's going  to be slower growth.</p><p> It's still super healthy.  We're not talking about a recession or anything.   It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little  more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a  little.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think that does raise a question, whether people are too  cautious.  The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings  growth, the multiples are not that huge.  Maybe on some of the tech names,  but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?  </p><p> GIBBS:  No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward  valuations and PEs.  And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings.   That is not super cheap.  That's actually in line with about your sort of  three-year average.</p><p> So yes, there's room to go up.  We could certainly go up, you know, 10  percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation.  But we could  also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6  percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.</p><p> So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say  definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets  for this market -- in this territory.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to mention retail really quickly.  A big list of  companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L.  Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Victoria's Secret.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there.   Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector?  Will it give us a  window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p> GIBBS:  Yes.  This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going  to see, look for guidance for the holiday season.  Right now forecast for  retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever.  We're looking at  about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes  to online. </p><p> What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and  manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit.  The people that  sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the  shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong  online presence.</p><p> And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to  consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up  and that type of thing.  So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going  to be an interesting year.  Yes, this is a very important week for those  holiday sales.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny  women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little  outdated.  The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's  Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell.  Anyway, that was my two  cents.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Agreed.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I put you on the spot -- Erin.  But let's hope for a nice  holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.  </p><p> GIBBS:  Yes, they did.  And they've been struggling.  And they -- again,  it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them.  These  big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you -- Erin.  Thank you so much.</p><p> Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology.

You got to stay tuned for that.  </p><p> To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim  Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I am not a big fan of regulation.  I'm a big  believer in the free market.  But we have to admit when the free market's  not working.  And it hasn't worked here.  And I think it's inevitable that  there will be some level of regulation.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory.   Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou  Basenese.  Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?  </p><p> LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Look,  he's being honest like, big tech blew it.  They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it.  And you know, I think it's unfair for  Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after  users' data and protected it, it's Apple.  Now, you flip over to Facebook  and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are  predicated on exploiting user data.  So, you know, built by association.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lou -- I mean, OK.   So, yes, it's a different business model.  I think we have to understand  that first of all.  And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to  be able to go on the offensive at this point.  He's -- yes, he's more of a  hardware maker.  Were as others sell free services, they take your data.   So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou  and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic.  There's no reason  to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this.  If you  remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out  there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too.   And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives  because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.  </p><p> But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit  holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex.  They do look  after our user data.  Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent  grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data  based on data images and key words you use.  I mean, is there no  information that's not safe from Facebook?  I mean, that's the kind of  thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people  from getting to your data.  </p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  To be fair though, I mean, to  say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a  little bit of fear mongering, right?  Because if they're putting this  together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free  access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a  value exchange that's happening.  And we're acting a little bit like it's  on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.  </p><p> BASENESE:  No, I agree with you.  There's got to be an exchange, right?   You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and  I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some  privacy.  But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your  protections kick in?  </p><p> So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering.  But at the end of the  day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses.  I  mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple  is at 0.4 percent.  So, you know, it's just built into that model and we  have to figure out.  Tim Cook said it, it didn't work.  The free market  didn't work here.  Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out  where that balance is.  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall  Street Journal.  I think we could argue whether the market's working or  not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working?  We've seen these  reports.  They didn't -- they want to share a little less information  lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd  like to see.  What kind of condition is Apple in right now?  </p><p> BASENESE:  Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium.  Less  transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing.  And you know, I think  this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying  that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models.  So we've  had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we  might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.  </p><p> But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple.  They're  really making this pivot to show that their services business.  I mean,  their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business.  So  it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right?  That's going to  be make or break for Apple.  And we're not going to get the data on whether  they sold enough iPhones.  And I really don't think that's as important as  how much money they've made per customer and from that those services  businesses.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.  </p><p> BASENESE:  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the  tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times  story last week.  It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg  adopts a more aggressive style.  Here's part of it.  Mr. Zuckerberg's new  approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key  executives from the company.  At times, it is created tensions with his  long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.  Lou, your take on  this.  </p><p> Again, where is this man's focus been?  If you're running the company, he  was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every  year.  And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in  Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a  cocktail, join the party, where have you been.  That all of these -- that  all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into  their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since  day one.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there.  I mean,  remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?  I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere  to be found for days.  I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership  here.  So look, I'm glad.  If he's really genuine about going to war, it's  about time.  Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen  short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early.   It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better  get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals  who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for  years.  LI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was the business model.  That's how they grew to the size  that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.  </p><p> But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do  you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my  home address is and why you need my phone number.  At every -- at every  moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more  information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the  service is for free.  Well, it's not free.  They're using your data and  they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for  the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade.  But -- well, also, I  think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is  that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political  spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise  that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right?  And  I think you're right, it's --  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Should they?  </p><p> BASENESE:  I think they should, absolutely.  I mean, look, the New York  Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right?  Saying that this was  known well in advance and what if Facebook -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in  2016.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FREEMAN:  But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is  because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of  media that our customers are consuming.  </p><p> BASENESE:  Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of  materiality.  And I would tell you that every single shareholder would  argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that  has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material.  So that's  not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the  public.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this,  I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been  going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about  it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Why -- exactly, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- that we would never know about any of this.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  It's a little bit rich.  </p><p> LI:  But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between  Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg.  There's no love lost between those two.  You  know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one  can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that  privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including  Facebook.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social  media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created  content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are,  do they get that liability waiver?  That's something that congress could  easily do, just pointing that out.  </p><p> Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.</p><p> BASENESE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Come back soon sir.  </p><p> BASENESE Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great conversation.  </p><p> Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the  holiday season's biggest shopping day.  </p><p> And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its  journey to Washington today, more coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, quick relationship to  tell you about, Dagen.  James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months  on the job.  Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the  company should evolve.  J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping  season without their CEO.  Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO  responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure  to appoint somebody new.  </p><p> All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right  now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the  National Christmas Tree at the White House today.  The nearly 20-foot tall,  800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured  in the Blue Room.  It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00  Eastern Time.  It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however.  They're  going to decorate it.</p><p> All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's  nice list.  An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay  away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either  I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later.  I get goose  bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the  Christmas spirit walking amongst us.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items,  the mystery man said Santa Claus can.  Store officials are not going to say  how much the secret Santa spent but good for him.  No bah humbug at that  Wal-Mart, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I  did not know, sadly.  It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach  mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.  </p><p> Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business,  all before they're old enough for college.  We'll speak to these two  entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in  their mom's kitchen.  And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year.   Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and  Isabel Bercaw.  Good to see you both.  </p><p> CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  Yes, you too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How old were you when you started this business?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  We were about 10 and 11.  Yes, it was pretty crazy.  </p><p> LI:  How did it start?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all  the time.  But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would  stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside  our bath bombs which was the surprise.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?  </p><p> ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  And we have bath  bombs for everybody.  So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and  kids a alike.  Because we want to have fun.</p><p> LI:  But how did you think we could turn this into a business?  You were 10  and 11 years old.</p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes, we first started at a local art fairs.  But then a local  salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in  his salon.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of  fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully  understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who  didn't discourage you.</p><p> I. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this.  And now, I just want  to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco,  Target, just to name a couple.  So it's gone beyond like the local salon  owner.  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p> I. BERCAW:  Yes.  We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right  now.  No question that we haven't had a lot of help.  You know, our parents  help us and our business partners help us and everything.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, Lee can help you.  Because she is a marketing and branding  wizard, if you need any free advice.  Lee?  </p><p> LI:  Offer some.  </p><p> CARTER:  I would love to do that separately.  But I'm curious, you said  that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been  exploring this idea on how you can grow your business.  Tell us a little  bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that  you've gotten along the way.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other  people and know that they've been there as well.  Because when you're  starting a business it's really hard work.  And there's a lot of fun as  well.  But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it?   So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road  as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop  kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so  supportive and just let us go with this.  So, thanks mom and dad.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of  more regular jobs?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background.  And  our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this.  So they kind of  work very well together.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to  follow in their footsteps.  </p><p> LI:  Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to  college? </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes.</p><p> I. BERCAW:  Yes.  If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look  at other subjects as well, as well as business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target  and Costco that I was talking about?  </p><p> C. BERCAW:  Yes, we recently launched with Costco.  We're in Ulta as well  and CVS, so.  </p><p> I. BERCAW:  And we just got a target end cap where all these new products  will be available.  So, they're brand-new additions to our line.  </p><p> CARTER:  Really exciting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bless you both.  And Happy holidays.  A Happy Thanksgiving to  both of you.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, November 19th, Happy  Thanksgiving, a little early.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern,  markets under pressure this morning.  Futures are down across the board, an  83-point loss on the Dow futures.  This after a down week for all three  market gauges.  The Dow and NASDAQ both falling more than two percent last  week. </p><p> The S&amp;P 500 hurt a little less, but was off more than 1-1/2 percent.  In  Europe, we do have gains to report in England and in France at the moment.   The DAX Index down ever so slightly.  But it was a winning start to the  week in Asia, all four major markets there to the plus side.  This despite  rising trade tensions with China.  Vice President Mike Pence back from the  Asia-Pacific Summit without an accord.  Now, the focus shifts to next  week's G20 Summit where President Trump is set to meet with China's  President Xi Jinping. </p><p> Trouble for Nissan, reports say that Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been  arrested for alleged financial violations in Japan.  The automaker holding  a news conference shortly where it is expected to announce Carlos Ghosn's  removal as chairman.  Devastation in California, crews searching for  victims of the deadly Camp Fire that has left at least 77 dead and nearly  unaccounted for.  We will have a live report from the ground in California. </p><p> Plus, Theresa May standing firm, why the British Prime Minister says that  ousting her will not make the U.K. exit from the European Union any easier.   And it's a cool idea, one company is going the extra mile to make sure its  coats are good fit.  Here to break it all down with me this morning, Fox  Business Network's Susan Li, along with Wall Street Journal Assistant  Editorial Page Editor James Freeman, and pollster and President of  Maslansky + Partners Lee Carter. </p><p> I was trying to get Lee to give the bath bomb young women a free advice -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Happy to do it.  Happy to do  it.  Just a short segment. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  I know on air, no.  I'm just kidding.  So much to discuss.   I can't wake to talk about trade, Apple, Facebook.  We much to explore in  the next hour.  But let's move on to trade tensions flaring between the  world's two biggest economies just ahead of talk between President Trump  and China Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit.  Edward Lawrence is live from the  White House with more.  Good morning, Edward. </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   The world is watching this trade dispute at a meeting over the weekend at  the Asian-Pacific Cooperation Summit.  The leaders could not come up with a  statement in part because of the Chinese and U.S. positions respectively.   Now, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended that conference along with Vice  President Mike Pence.  Now, the vice president will be here at the White  House later on today to brief the president on exactly what happened there. </p><p> Well, Chinese media now reporting that their vice premier will not come to  Washington, D.C. this week.  He was supposed to lay the groundwork with  treasury officials for that bilateral meeting with President Xi and  President Donald Trump in Buenos Aires later on this month.  That meeting  will now happen between the ministers after the presidential meeting on  December 1st.  Now, last week, the Chinese sent a list to the U.S. of what  they would like to see changed in order to have a trade agreement between  the two countries. </p><p> The president on Friday saying this was a long list and some things not a  good list.  But, again, he says it's a start.  Now, talking with Chris  Wallace over the weekend, he says, his tone is what's given him this  presidential wins and a good economy including on trade. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Because you have people  coming at you so hard that if you don't fight back in a somewhat vigorous  way, you're not going to win. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE:  And as that talk at the president has $267 billion more of  Chinese goods that he could possibly put under tariffs.  On Friday, the  president saying he's going to hold off on that.  We'll see what happens  out of this meeting between he and President Xi, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Edward.  Edward Lawrence for us at the White House.   Joining us now is House Judiciary Committee member Texas Congressman Louie  Gohmert.  Congressman, your take on this and the state of trade in our  relationship with China. </p><p> REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  Well, I know a lot of people are upset  that, oh, it appears to be breaking down.  But I recall, the best  negotiating that Reagan ever did was when Gorbachev said get rid of the  missile defense and you can have everything else you want, and he got up  and left the table.  It was the best thing he ever did.  It led to a great  deal for us and eventually to the demise of the Soviet Union.  We're not  looking for the demise of China. </p><p> But I know there are some senators that say, we need to pass a bill that  get rid of the tariffs or the ability the president threatened tariffs.  He  is a deal maker and you know when it's about business, it's good to have a  businessman.  I was told years ago by a U.S. trade rep, Louie, you got to  understand that we know we have the biggest economy in the world, so when  we make a trade deal that's better for other countries than us, it really  inures to our benefit. </p><p> Well, garbage.  We -- if it's better for them, it's better for them and we  got a guy that knows how to negotiate and uses leverage in this case  tariffs. </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you that  over in the Pacific after this APEC Summit, my sources are saying that it's  all been shaken up because I guess Asian tradition goes with process,  procedure, and what they know best, right?  So with this president shaking  things up, it's, you know, some people are calling this a new front, a new  cold war that is taking place between the U.S. and China, your thoughts? </p><p> GOHMERT:  Well, it's been pretty cool for a long time because China has  been stealing our goods, stealing our technology, so the war was going on.   It was just a one-sided -- </p><p> LI:  Would you call it a cold war though, is that how you would  characterize the relationship? </p><p> GOHMERT:  It's a little bit if not -- it's freezing.  It's tepid.  It's  always been because China is not out to see the United States end up doing  well.  So only to the extent that they get paid back the money we owe them,  so, yes.  It's -- maybe not a cold war but a cool war.  But it's still  doesn't mean you can't negotiate.  But you got to use leverage and I'm  thankful we got a president knows how to make deals. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  James Freeman maybe frosty would be a good work.  Continue. </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I'm wondering how long it stays  frosty.  You seem, congressman, optimistic that there is going to be a deal  here.  Do you foresee it in the immediate term here or do you think this  goes on for a while? </p><p> GOHMERT:  It's completely up to the Chinese.  I see that we will eventually  get a deal because the Chinese they're not stupid.  They know that when  there is a tariff war usually neither side of the tariff war wins.  But the  president should not have the leverage removed.  It, you know, every time  he brings up tariffs, he usually has the backdoors.  Now, if you work out a  trade deal with us then we'll be able to forget about the tariffs. </p><p> So I think we will get that worked out and it will be to the United States'  benefit instead of continuing to make another deal that hurts us -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, how quickly -- how quickly can -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know.  Just really -- how quickly can you get the U.S.- Mexico-Canada deal approved?  </p><p> GOHMERT:  Oh, I think it will be approved very quickly, yes.  That's going  to be good better for us than NAFTA.  Napa, NAFTA.  I've got Napa on the  brain.  I feel sorry for those folks.  They've been through it.  But, you  know, I think we'll get it approve very quickly.  I don't think it will be  that big of a problem. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to the border, hundreds of Tijuana residents  protesting the arrival of thousands of migrants yesterday attempting to  enter the United States.  This comes as border wall construction will soon  begin in Southern Texas.  Congressman Gohmert, you represent the people of  Texas, your thoughts on this.  Do you get more border wall funding in the  budget?  What do you say? </p><p> GOHMERT:  Well, I've said each of the last two weeks, we were in session in  September that, you know, the Trump voters will come out in 2020.  They've  seen the president do all he could.  But they haven't seen us try to help  the president really at all, and we ought to put money in.  If we don't put  money in for the president to build a wall before the election, there's a  good chance we'll lose the majority.  Nobody listened.  We lose majority. </p><p> The least we can do is get money in there now and I know that we're working  on that I've talked to people that we have elected in leadership positions  that are trying to make sure we get something done to help the president  with the border wall.  The best thing we can do for the people of Mexico  and Central America is get a wall, built where we need it, secure the  border, cut off the hundreds of billions of dollars that have flowed for  drugs, for human trafficking, for sex trafficking because once we cut that  off then the corruption in Mexico comes to a crawl and it becomes one of  the top 10 economies in the world. </p><p> It should have already been if we had nipped the drug cartels, but we  haven't done that.  This president is going to do it for you. </p><p> LEE:  So, congressman, we know that immigration was one of the number one  issues to voters out there.  There's been a lot of criticism since the  election saying that Republicans used the caravan in a scare tactic to sort  of stoke that and make immigration more important and hope that they, you  know, would get into office and then they dropped it ever since.  How do  you respond to that now as the caravan is getting closer and we've got this  right in front of us? </p><p> GOHMERT:  Well, I'm just grateful that, you know, alt-left and media like  CNN, MSNBC now realized, oh, there really are people.  It was not just an  election rouse.  These people have continued to come and they are a threat  to our sovereignty.  If we cannot enforce our borders then like Woodrow  Wilson did, when my least favorite president when he put 75,000 national  guard on the border after Pancho Villa came in and killed Americans.  I  mean this is something we've got to do. </p><p> There were seven -- over 70,000 Americans killed last year by the poison  that is being sold to us by the drug cartels.  This is important.  We got  to stop it.  We got to quit enriching the drug cartels and if we let these  folks in then there's just going to be wave after wave until we can kiss  the America we knew goodbye.  You have to have people that understand how  to keep a self-government and these folks don't know how to do that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Although Woodrow Wilson as a fellow Virginian, he's also behind  basically the arrival of the income tax in the United States, so that's  something to dislike about him as well. </p><p> GOHMERT:  Oh, he's my least favorite, yes. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, thank you. </p><p> GOHMERT:  Thank you so much, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, no, I got one -- I'll move on to another topic,  Justice Department showdown President Trump addressing acting Attorney  General Matthew Whitaker's role and potentially limiting Special Counsel  Robert Mueller's probe during a Fox News interview yesterday.  Listen to  this. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  It's going to be up to him.  I think he's very well aware  politically.  I think he's astute politically.  He's a very smart person.   A very respected person.  He's going do what's right.  I really believe  he's going to do what's right. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This comes as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes  weighed in on what will happen to investigations over FISA abuse  allegations when the Democrats take over the House.  Here's what he told  Maria on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  We have three  buckets of information that we want declassified.  We now have a fourth  bucket that we want declassified.  The president has called for three of  those four to be declassified.  This begs an investigation by the  Department of Justice.  So either the Department of Justice under new  leadership can actually go in and investigate these cast of dirty cops is  really what they were and their connections to the Russians and their  connections to the Clinton campaign. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, your reaction to this and I just also want to point  out that John Roberts is reporting that the president will not be  submitting answers to Robert Mueller's team today, those written answers  they have been talked about, so your reaction to what you just heard. </p><p> GOHMERT:  Well, I've worked with some of the folks on the Intel Committee  and they're doing all they can.  The president got some bad advice and  pulling back from declassifying all of the material that was being sought.   That stuff needs to come out.  It -- and he was told that it takes -- it's  a long slow process.  People that know told me we could get it done in an  hour if we're allowed to do that.  And so, we have got to get this stuff  out.  But as far as Matt Whitaker, I mean Matt is a great guy. </p><p> He's a great American.  He should have protected his boss better from those  that work for Rosenstein that have been undermining him.  I went over and  told Jeff who is undermining him and what they're doing and went over and  talked to Matt, and they -- he did not protect his boss.  And now, he's in  his boss' job.  But let me -- let me say this real quick, Dagen, you know,  you picked a jury.  You're not entitled to jurors that it never had an  opinion. </p><p> What you're entitled to is somebody that will be fair going forward and  making appropriate determinations.  They're not entitled to a brain-dead  acting attorney general and Matt is doing fine.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, good to see you.  Congressman Louie Gohmert, we'll  see you soon.  </p><p> GOHMERT:  Good to see you, Dagen.  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Come up -- coming up, Florida recount chaos, the details as  Republican Governor Rick Scott wins the Senate seat in the Sunshine State.   More ahead. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Republican Rick Scott officially defeating Democrat Bill Nelson  in the Florida Senate race.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Hey, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Took a while.  That's true,  Dagen.  Incumbent Bill Nelson conceding in the Senate race to Governor Rick  Scott after a hand recount. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. BILL NELSON (D-FL), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious in  this race.  But I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  We may have been heavily outspent in this this campaign, but we  were never outworked.  To all Floridians, whether you voted for me or for  my opponent, or that you didn't vote at all, I ask you to never give up  this fight. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Scott issuing a statement saying, \"I just spoke with Senator  Bill Nelson who graciously conceded and I thanked him for his years of  public service.\"  Scott's win gets Florida two Republican Senators for the  first time in more than a century.  Meanwhile, Florida embattled Broward  County election official Brenda Snipes has reportedly resigned following  heavy criticism over her handling of vote in the midterm election. </p><p> Well, Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested.  The automaker making  the announcement at a news conference in Tokyo just moments ago.  The  company is going to propose ousting Ghosn at a board meeting that's being  held on Thursday after they uncovered significant acts of misconduct.   Japanese media say that Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo after meeting with  prosecutors on suspicion that he falsified his financial reports including  allegedly under reporting his income by millions. </p><p>Nissan also confirming that board member Greg Kelly is also under arrest  this morning.  Ghosn rescued Nissan from their bankruptcy starting back at  1999.  He's also the chairman and chief executive which I should say of  Nissan's partner Renault.  French President Emanuel Macron says that France  wants to ensure stability at the auto alliance and they will protect those  workers at Renault.  Shares of Nissan we should are down nearly 10 percent  so far this year. </p><p> Well, Canada Goose wants customers to put a thousand dollar parkas to the  test against the harshest of conditions, so much another adding get this  frigid rooms to some stores.  You can test the high-end coat in  temperatures as low as negative 13.  The rooms even come with a wind-chill  button.  This is very interesting new approach as part of the company's  plan to increasingly sell directly to consumers instead of relying on  wholesalers like they have done in the past. </p><p> I think it's a great idea, Dagen, and you know what you're dealing with  before you get out there and catch pneumonia because your coat is not warm  enough. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a great idea buying -- never mind. </p><p> CASONE:  One thousand dollar coat.  I -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- is the fur thing.  I mean -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- there are a lot of other things on the planet that can keep  you warm without fur.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, a path of  destruction.  We have live to California as officials say the deadly  wildfire isn't even halfway finished burning yet.  Plus, a tale of two  cities, why New York City's mayor is backing Amazon's decision to setup  shop in the Big Apply but not Wal-Mart, guess why?  I think you can.  More  on the story straight ahead. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Futures are pointing to a lower open this morning.  But there  are also lows of the morning so far 44-point loss on the Dow futures right  now as investors watch negotiations with China.  We do have some retail  earnings coming out this week.  I think investors will be looking for any  sign that the holiday shopping season is going to be a strong one as we get  close to a Thanksgiving and the kind of unofficial start of the shopping  season.  James, your thoughts on where markets are right now? </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  So we're not seeing a huge dip maybe a lot of trade concern  priced and a lot of negative expectations about this negotiations priced  in, and if our friend, Mr. Scaramucci is right and Mr. Gohmert is right,  and you actually get a quick resolution of this that would suggest there's  a lot of room to run for these markets.  </p><p> LI:  But one of the main drags right now in the premarket is Apple once  again which dipped into correction territory.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting that even more suppliers (INAUDIBLE) reducing their outlook for  the year because they don't expect as many orders to come from Apple in the  future.  So I guess the markets are lacking leadership and there are  concerns about economic growth going into next year which Goldman Sachs  says will only grow in the one percent area. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I worry about any infrastructure spending bill that the  Democrats and Republicans try to get done together given where our debt and  our deficits are right now, and what that could do to interest rates  because if you're worried about interest rates here, you're going to be  biting your fingernails when the 10-year yield is at three and a half  percent -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- four percent. </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Maybe in terms of if you're hoping for some pro-growth  legislation to come out next year, maybe there's an immigration deal where  you can allow more legal immigration.  I think that would be the only hope. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to the devastation in California.  A pair of  wildfires leaving at least 80 people dead, nearly 1,000 people are still  unaccounted for.  Jonathan Hunt has the latest in Malibu, California.   Jonathan? </p><p> JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, good morning to you.   The flames are no longer the issue either in and around the Camp Fire in  Northern California nor in the Woolsey Fire down here in Southern  California.  The fires are under control.  But the big concern now  particularly around the Camp Fire up in the north is the ongoing search for  bodies.  As you mentioned, there are still close to 1,000 people listed as  unaccounted for and teams have been going through what remains of the town  of Paradise desperately trying to search for any human remains that may  help them identify some of the missing. </p><p> It's a race against time because rain is coming in the next 24 to 36 hours.   And when you're talking about properties that have been burned to tiny  pieces of ash finding human remains is difficult enough.  If the rains come  in and wash a lot of those ashes away, it will become even more difficult.   Meantime though, there was a vigil held near Paradise, California for those  who survived the deadly fires.  That was held last night.  A lot of people  showing up simply because they wanted to be in the presence of other  survivors.  Listen here. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARRIE LYNN, PARADISE RESIDENT:  I just know that God is comforting us as  far as imagine and we're living in.  It's really -- and then I look around  at all the kindness. </p><p> JOE FLORENCE, PARADISE RESIDENT:  My wife is -- she needs some closure.  To  be around other people that have gone through the same thing that we have,  it helps with the grieving process. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> HUNT:  Here in Southern California, in Malibu in particular, many residents  are being allowed back in.  Although, a lot of them are finding this.  You  can see behind me that they have pretty much nothing left.  Also concerns  about rain coming here this week.  Dagen, you can't see to my right in this  dark, but we're beneath the Santa Monica Mountains.  When you get these  fires, it burns away all the brush, all the trees.  That essentially means  there's no anchors for the topsoil on there. </p><p> You get the rains.  We get mudslides.  We saw it last year after the big  fires in Santa Barbara followed by deadly mudslides.  That is now the fear  here in Malibu, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jonathan, thank you for all your reporting.  Jonathan Hunt in  Malibu for us.  </p><p> HUNT:  Sure. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, battle over Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May now  issuing a stark warning to opponents threatening to unseat her.  Former  foreign policy adviser former under Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is  weighing in on those negotiations.  That is next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo, it's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure to start this shortened holiday week, Futures lower across  the board; 52-point loss on the Dow Futures right now after a losing week  for all three major market gauges last week.  In Europe, some mixed market  action we have right now, all of the markets there are up but FTSE and the  CAC in France have been toggling back-and-forth between negative and  positive, but green across the board right now.  </p><p> This as British Prime Minister Theresa May assures Britain that ousting her  will not make Britain's exit from the European Union any easier.  And then  we move on to protests in France, the newest problem facing President  Emmanuel Macron that has the French taking to the streets.  Asian markets  finishing higher overnight; gains across the board on all four major  markets there.</p><p>Facebook, under more fire.  First details on why CEO Mark Zuckerberg  reportedly has the company on red alert, then a report on why cutting back  on the social media site is good for your mental health.  And then,  Amazon's big move from super secrecy during the headquartered two selection  process to hot shots from \"Saturday Night Live\" over weekend.  That and  more, the latest from the online retailer. </p><p> To our top story this half-hour.  Moving the plan forward, British Prime  Minister Theresa May is selling agreement for great Britain's exit from the  European Union.  The British leader citing her deal's tough measures on  immigration is one of its strengths; May re-enforcing her resolve to see  this through to the end earlier today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  My job is to get the best deal.   Parliament must then examine it and do what is in national interest.  We  have in view a deal that will work for the U.K. and let no one be in any  doubt, I am determined to deliver it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here now, Director of the Thatcher Center for Freedom at the  Heritage Foundation, Nile Gardiner.  Now, your reaction to Theresa May's  comments and her handling of the Brexit.  </p><p> NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF THE THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM AT THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Well, good morning.  I have to say that Theresa May's handling  of the Brexit negotiations have been absolutely disastrous.  In effect,  it's really been a surrender to the European Union.  And the proposal that  she has put forward is completely unacceptable.  It, basically, makes  Britain subservient to the European Union; it does not take Britain outside  of the E.U. Customs Union, the U.K. will not able to sign free trade  agreements including with the United States.  So, this is a deal that does  not restore British sovereignty and self-determination and freedom to the  British people.  </p><p> So, Theresa May, I think, has not lived up to the promises she made to the  British people earlier.  And in many ways, and this is an appalling weak- kneed deal offered by the British prime minister, which is being heavily  opposed by a large number of MPs within her party and she's faced a wave of  resignations, there'll be more resignations to come.  She could indeed face  a vote of \"no\" confidence later this week, if enough conservative MPs come  forward to call for such a vote.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Nile, James Freeman here with the Wall Street Journal.  It sounds  like you're more in camp of wanting what we call hard Brexit, do you feel  like there would be an opportunity for the U.K. out of the E.U. to do a  trade deal, perhaps join our new NAFTA-USMCA, perhaps other moves.  Can you  give us your forecast for if Britain leaves the E.U. completely?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, Brexit definitely taking place on March 29, 2019.  It's a  matter of what kind of Brexit it is.  And the British people in 2016 voted  in huge number: 17.4 million Britons voted to leave the European Union;  they understood that they were leaving the single market and customs union  when they voted.  That was the key message from the voted leave campaign,  the official campaign to vote to leave the European Union.  </p><p> And so, the British people want to see their sovereignty restored.  Theresa  May's deal does not deliver that; it's far better, I think, for Britain to  -- either renegotiate this new May proposal or seek a \"no\" deal Brexit  where Britain trades with the rest of the world under WTO terms also trades  with E.U. under WTO terms.  It would be far preferable, I think, to what  Theresa May is offering which is a deal that shackles Britain indefinitely  to the European Union, that's not what British people voted for.  </p><p> CARTER:  Is there anyone -- I'm curious, because it was so divided when  Brexit was voted on and there were so many people who wanted to say, is  there anyone right now who looks at this deal and says, I'm happy that  we're not doing a hard exit -- is there any of the constituents here who  said this is, this is what we should be doing?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, certainly there are, you know, some supporters of Theresa  May within the conservative party.  There are also, I think, big business  interests who have backed the Theresa May proposal.  There are also many  business leaders who oppose this deal as well.  So, certainly, there has  been a mixed reaction to this, but if you look at the public opinion polls,  there is less than 20 percent support for the Theresa May deal right now.   It's deeply unpopular.  There's a lack of trust in the prime minister and  she's no Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May, that's for sure.  </p><p> Margaret Thatcher would've negotiated a tough deal in the British national  interests.  In addition, Theresa May has pledged to hand over 39 billion  pounds to European Union for nothing in return.  I think the, you know, the  British have been treated with utter, you know, disdain and contempt by  European Union, and this is a sheer blackmail from the E.U. here and should  not give in to these demands.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So, it sounds like you're not a Theresa May fan, is  that fair to characterize you that way?  Does she need to go?  </p><p> GARDINER:  I have to say, she's been hugely disappointing and I think if  she faces a vote of \"no\" confidence, there's a very good chance, I think,  that we could see a new prime minister by the end of this year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to move across the channel to France.  Protests erupting  over increased taxes on fuel, now what do these protests say about the  popularity of Macron's presidency?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Uh, well, I think -- you know, Emmanuel Macron's presidency has  been nothing short of disastrous, really.  He has an opinion poll rating at  around, sort of, 21 percentage points which is not exactly a vote of  confidence from the French people.  I think that Emmanuel Macron is seen as  deeply out of touch, as arrogant, as someone who doesn't understand the  concerns of ordinary French voters.  He's a politician, I think, he was  full of, sort of, you know, grand visionary ideas, that cannot understand,  you know, why his own voters don't -- you know, don't support him anymore.  </p><p> And this latest fuel tax which hits tens of millions of French drivers is  deeply unpopular, that's fueling the protests, but Emmanuel Macron, I  think, as somebody who really lives in a sort of another, you know,  political dimension, who dreams of creating a grand European Union Army  while his own people around from the streets protesting against his  leadership, so I think there's a lot of delusional thinking, actually, in  the Elysee Palace these days under Emmanuel Macron.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nile, this is a conversation I had over the weekend with  someone, that the socialists, the kind of new born American socialist that  we hear from quite often, they kind of preach that if we just tax the one  percent more, we can pay for all of these lovely things that Americans  need, but that is not what goes on in other nations, say, across Europe.   The people of these nations -- and I look at France, are taxed to their  teeth, in the form of gas taxes, you name -- value-added taxes.  It's not  just the one percent that's paying for if everything.  </p><p> And in fact, in this country, if you confiscated every single dollar that  the top one percent earned in adjusted growth income, it wouldn't be enough  money to pay for Medicare for all, it' would be two trillion versus 3.2.  trillion.  You would have to confiscate every dollar of adjusted growth  income from the top five percent and that would only pay for Medicare for  all and these protests kind of speak to that. </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes, I think, you know, French people have had enough of, you  know, huge state taxes and, you know, France has been basically, sort of, a  big government, sort of, economic you know, basket case for successive  decades thanks to, you know, to high tax policies.  You know, hundreds of  thousands of French citizens have fled to London over the past decade  seeking jobs and opportunities in lower taxes, actually and so you've got  economic refugees leaving France heading to -- especially to the U.K. where  there's a lower tax regime and more free market policies.  </p><p> And basically, I think, increasing Europeans are rejecting socialist style  government -- and at the end of the day, Emmanuel Macron is a big  government thinker, he talks about, you know, free trade, he talks about  free markets.  But in reality, you know, France remains whetted to very  high levels of taxation, it has high levels of unemployment; Emmanuel  Macron is at heart a protectionist he's someone who calls Brexit a crime.   You know, this is a leader who, I think, is just deeply out of touch with,  you know, his own -- you know, his own people and I think is the reflection  of the huge economic problems that you see across big government high tax  European Union today.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  James, real quick.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, he -- obviously, Macron came into office promising the  opposite: A more dynamic economy.  </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  A more open economy in France, I guess it hasn't happened,  exactly.  </p><p> GARDINER:  That is not that -- that is not materialized at all.  And in  fact, I think, you know, Emmanuel Macron's big priority right now is a  creation of some sort of grand European Union super state.  So, he is  leader of the Euro Federalist in Europe and its latest plan calls to build  a European Union Army which he calls -- calls for to challenge the United  States.  And so, this is the mindset of the, of the French president right  now, completely delusional and out of touch with reality altogether.  And  so, it's hard to see how Emmanuel Macron is going to be re-elected in 2022  at this rate.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What are they using baguettes as spears and power of taxation to  frighten everyone?  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  Thank you so much, sir.   Great to see you, Nile Gardiner.</p><p> GARDINER:  Thank you very much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.  Facebook fallout Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney  that is, will weigh in on how the Web site can make people depressed.   \"Saturday Night Live\" poking fun at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STEVE CARELL, ACTOR:  Hi everyone, as you know, Amazon just announced  location of its two new headquarters in New York and Virginia.  And  everyone, except for the people who live there and people who live in all  the places we didn't choose, is thrilled.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  More of Steve Carell.  We have to say thank you to Susan Li,  you'll catch her at the New York Stock Exchange all day.  She's working  hard, stay with us, Varney straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  More fallout for Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg under fire over  his reactions to damaging reports about the company.  And now, a new study  also shows it can make you depressed.  Joining me now is the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  OK.  Actually, there is a new  study.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And it is objective.  It's from the University of Pennsylvania.   Now, this has got nothing to do with Facebook's data breaches or their, you  know, censorship of conservative opinion, this is something completely  separate.  This is getting used to this new thing, social networks.  Well,  the University of Pennsylvania studied I think 140, 150 undergraduates at  the college, and for some of them, half of them, they took away their  social network usage.  Then just limited to 10 minutes a day, that half of  the study, their mood all improved.  No more depression, no more, what --  less depression, less anxiety.  The other group which stayed with social  networks hours and hours and hours a day, no improvement in mood  whatsoever.  Apparently, this is the first cause and effect study that's  being recognized as Facebook can give you depression.</p><p> Now, this occur -- it occurs to me that, you know, younger person, you're  on Facebook, and you're scrolling through other people's lives, and all the  people's lives on Facebook are always wonderful, great boyfriend, great  girlfriend, fabulous family, new job, new house, wonderful vacation on the  beach, you got it all.  But what about you?  You look bad in comparison to  all of your friends and relatives who are looking so good on Facebook.  So  you get depressed because you're not enjoying life like they are.  And it's  a way -- we have to get used to this thing, it's not going to go away.   But, we have to get used to how to use it, and I don't think we're there  yet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I stopped using Facebook, and even before that, Stuart, I lied  about virtually every bit of information I ever gave them.  I am actually  25 years of age according to Facebook whereabouts.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, and I'm 39.  You know, that's life, but I -- actually, I  don't use Facebook.  I don't do it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You have other -- you're out cutting brush and doing things  outdoors, so I can't imagine you ever having time to like scroll through  recipes for ooey gooey butter cake on Facebook.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're absolutely right there, Dagen.  And no contest.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just do not see that being your bag, Mr. Varney.</p><p>VARNEY:  Not me.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not at all.  But doing T.V. is, and Stuart is coming up in about  10 minutes' time every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Stuart  Varney 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Thank you, Stuart, great to see you, my friend.</p><p> Coming up, a tale two of cities, why New York City's Mayor is backing  Amazon's decision to set up shop in the Big Apple, and the hand-outs and  perks Amazon got.  But no Wal-Mart.  Guess why, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Headquarter headache, Amazon facing fallout over its big move to  New York City from people all over the political spectrum.  Lauren  Simonetti has the latest.  Hey, Lauren.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Dagen, didn't you  know that some big businesses are good and others are bad?  Well, at least  that's the rationale merging from New York City's winning bid for Amazon's  second headquarters or part of it.  Mayor Bill de Blasio bring up his  efforts to keep Wal-Mart out in response while on a local radio program on  Friday.  This is what he said, \"I was actively involved in the effort to  keep Wal-Mart out of New York City.  Wal-Mart is an entirely different  universe in terms of the systematic efforts they've taken to undermine  labor, small business, the environment, American workers, and obviously,  the politics of the Walton family.  Wal-Mart does not belong in New York  City.\"</p><p> Yes, he's rolling out the red carpet for Amazon, though, which also doesn't  support unions, which also kills off mom and pops, and hasn't put his money  where CEO Jeff Bezos' politics are or at least where the politics of his  newspaper at The Washington Post are.  Whereas this was interesting, I did  some research on this, Wal-Mart's Walton family has given money to  democratic politicians in the past including the Governor of New York  Andrew Cuomo.  But let's get back to basics, he was played by Steve Carell,  must-see T.V.  This was \"Saturday Night Live\" watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARELL:  Some folks have speculated that I was somehow trolling President  Trump by building one headquarters in his hometown of Queens, and the other  in his current residence of Washington D.C., thereby overshadowing or  humiliating them, but that's simply not true.  Sure, he attacked me  repeatedly on Twitter, but I chose our new locations because they were  ideal for growing business, not just to make Donald Trump think about how  I'm literally 100 times richer that he is.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  It was awesome.  I love the part where they put up all the  Twitter attacks.  You know, the SNL writers only knew the dog codenames  that he -- that the company gave for the 20 finalists competing for the  second quarters.  Crystal City, Virginia or Arlington (INAUDIBLE) New York  (INAUDIBLE) so the Amazon is very dog-friendly.  They basically gave each  of the cities a dog name for their codename.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But by -- can we go back to the de Blasio thing.  Because you  don't like -- you don't actually like the perks, the tax perks that New  York City got, but in terms of the politics, no company helps lower-income  Americans more than a Wal-Mart, and giving people easy access to very  inexpensive goods and groceries, so they are on par with Amazon.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, thank God -- thank goodness Mr. de Blasio is not running the  country.  This idea that I'm going to treat businesses differently because  I don't like the politics of their owners, this is -- this is the New York  Model, it's keep taxes very high, and no businesses would want to come  here, so then decide particular businesses that you like to give big  incentives to.  There, just lower rates for everybody.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mayor Pothole will never be President Pothole.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lauren Simonetti, thank you.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Freeman, Carter, thank you.</p><p> CARTER:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's all about Mr. Varney, Stuart Varney.  Take it away, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, thank you so much.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p>We break it all down.  </p><p>Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p>The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p>In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p>In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p>Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p>But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p>But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p>And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p>And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p>Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p>Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p>And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p>And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p>And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p>So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p>So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p>So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p>Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p>And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p>So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p>Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p>But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p>Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p>I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p>And second of all -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p>I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p>But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p>And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p>LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p>LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p>LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p>LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p>They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p>But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p>I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p>CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p>And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p>So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p>LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p>But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p>LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p>And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p>But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p>CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p>These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p>Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p>LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.

When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p>So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p>LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p>I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>CARTER:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.

Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p>She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p>Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.

He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p>\"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p>In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p>Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p>One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p>CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p>CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p>So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p>Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p>LI:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p>We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p>Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p>A full roundup, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p>A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p>Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p>Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p>Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p>The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p>So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p>President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p>But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p>Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p>JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.

Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p>Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p>He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p>There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p>And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p>And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p>Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p>ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p>So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p>Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p>I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p>And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p>I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p>And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p>So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p>Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p>The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p>So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p>Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p>But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p>I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p>And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p>The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p>Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p>Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p>With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p>And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p>And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p>I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p>We'll tell you more.  </p><p>And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p>Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p>More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p>In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p>Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p>From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p>We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p>Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p>RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p>And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p>And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p>No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p>Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p>And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p>But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p>Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p>But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p>I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p>I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p>CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p>And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p>And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p>And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p>I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p>LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p>MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p>You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p>Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p>MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.

U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.

The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.

Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J.

Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p>Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.   Though, she said she would like to get to call a couple of plates for  Browns, and open doors for women in coaching. </p><p>Watch this Formula 3 crash, at 171 miles per hour.  17-year-old German,  Sophia Floersch, fractured her spine, fractured a facial bone, suffered  concussion and other lacerations; 170 miles per hour at the Macau Grand  Prix in China.  She says, I'm fine but will go into surgery tomorrow.   NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series championship, Homestead, Miami, 12 laps to  go -- oh, well, this is actually before the race.  The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p>CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p>MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p>CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p>MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p>MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p>MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p>CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p>CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p>MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p>MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p>MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p>CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.  Thank you so much, Jared.   Sports Reports Fox New Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 155.  Still ahead,  Christmas is coming to the White House.  The tree will arrive in Washington  later today.  Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top story at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p>We break it all down.  </p><p>Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p>The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p>In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p>In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p>Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p>But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p>But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p>And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p>And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p>Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p>Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p>And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p>And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p>And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p>So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p>So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p>So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p>Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p>And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p>So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p>Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p>But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p>Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p>I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p>And second of all -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p>I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p>But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p>And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p>LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p>LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p>LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p>LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p>They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p>But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p>I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p>CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p>And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p>So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p>LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p>But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p>LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p>And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p>But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p>CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p>These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p>Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p>LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.  These are some of the names I've  downgraded now.  </p><p>Their revenue forecast for the year because they're not expecting as many  orders coming from Apple, and this isn't first time that Apple's had  problems with launching a new handset.  </p><p>Remember, the iPhone 5c, do you remember?  The cheaper iPhone that they  launched five years ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  A month later, they also cut become on their orders as well because it  wasn't selling as well.</p><p>I think it's a -- it's a reality that there's saturation in the market.   People have the Apples and the handsets that they need.  </p><p>Can you keep selling 200 million plus each and every year?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then that separate chipmaker, the graphics chipmaker,  NVIDIA, it entered a bear market almost in one day.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Has -- it was down 19 percent.</p><p>LI:  But they've had that track record, up crash, up crash over the last  ten years.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They have.  </p><p>I want to move on to American and Chinese trade tensions boiling over at  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  </p><p>China reportedly upset of the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly  singling out their trade practices.</p><p>This was the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in  which the parties did not issue a communique.  James, your reaction to  this.</p><p>How much should we read into this issue?  Again, it made the front page of  \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Oh, boy.  \"Summit Breaks Amid Trade Tensions.\"</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p>So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p>LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p>I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>CARTER:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.  The final Florida  Election results are in.  Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p>She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p>Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  A public office is a public trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  That public trust now in the hands of Senator-elect Rick Scott.   He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p>\"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p>In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p>Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p>One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p>CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p>CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p>So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p>Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p>LI:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p>We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p>Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p>A full roundup, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p>A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p>Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p>Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p>Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p>The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p>So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p>President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p>But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p>Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p>JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.  It has to be you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald brought in  $16 million, but that makes it the lowest total ever for an opening weekend  in the Harry Potter franchise.  </p><p>These movies were spinoff of Harry Potter and it was filmed with 16 percent  below their 2016 opening weekend, the first version of this one.</p><p>Last week's box office winner, Doctor Seuss' The Grinch brought in just  over $38 million.  </p><p>And rounding up the top five, Bohemian Rhapsody, that's the Queen movie.   New release, Instant Family, and Widows rounding out your numbers, Dagen,  and those are your headlines.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p>Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p>He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p>There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p>And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p>And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p>Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p>ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p>So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p>Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p>I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p>And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p>I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p>And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p>So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p>Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p>The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p>So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p>Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p>But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p>I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p>And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p>The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p>Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p>Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p>With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p>And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p>And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p>I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p>We'll tell you more.  </p><p>And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p>Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p>More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p>In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p>Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p>From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p>We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p>Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p>RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p>And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p>And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p>No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p>Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p>And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p>But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p>Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p>But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p>I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p>I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p>CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p>And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p>And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p>And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p>I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p>LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p>MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p>You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p>Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p>MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.  And Hollywood magic, coming to YouTube, video-sharing sites new  venture into streaming, free, future link flicks.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Saudi Arabia's King Salman, delivering a speech on foreign  policy this morning.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Dagen.  King Salman bin Abdulaziz, is giving his first public  address since the killing of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi,  after embarking on a nationwide tour with his son, the Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman.  U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.  I know  exactly, I know everything that went on where that happened -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the crowned prince has continuously denied his involvement  in Khashoggi's murder.  </p><p>Well, General Electric reportedly facing a dilemma in Iraq, as the company  seeks power sales.  The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.  The report advises G.E. to distance himself  from at least one of its contracts there.  G.E. is competing with Germany's  Siemens for multi-billion-dollar new power contracts throughout that  country.  Shares of G.E. are lower in the pre-market, a quarter of a  percent right now.  </p><p>Well YouTube is now streaming full length movies for free.  But, of course,  there's a catch because nothing is free, right?  To enjoy them, you've got  to endure advertisements that support the movie.  But if you are willing to  pay to be a YouTube premium subscriber the ads go away.  Movies so far  include \"Rocky,\" \"Zookeeper,\" and \"Legally Blonde\" among other.  Shares of  Google parent company, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, up about one percent  so far this year, Dagen.  And there you go, another way to stream content.   Like number 50.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I hooked my dad with streaming his ACC games or his  University of Virginia games.</p><p>CASONE:  Nice, that's important.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a -- that was a long row, so to speak.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, the teaching moments with our parents can be interesting  sometimes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, dreams of Coach Condi; why  Condoleezza Rice says that she will not be coaching Cleveland Browns.  More  sports, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A lot of drama in NFL yesterday.  Jared Max is here with all of  your sports highlights.  Hey, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  There were  three walk off wins on last second field goals by the Broncos, the Cowboys  and the Raiders.  Last minute comeback went for the Steelers -- how about  the Vikings last night?  First place, Bears were up 14-0.  They were  leading 14-6 when Chicago's Eddy Jackson intercepted Kirk Cousins, brought  it in for a touchdown.  Chicago led 20-6, now, the bear were leading 25-20.   Two minutes to go, Minnesota after a touchdown tries an onside kick, but  the Bears recovering.  Chicago wins, now 7-3 way to off the NFC north.  </p><p>33 years to the day since legendary Washington Redskins Quarterback Joe  Theismann suffered a career-ending injury -- he was at the Skins' game  Sunday, where the team's current quarterback, Alex Smith suffered identical  injuries that Theismann did.  Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p>Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.   Though, she said she would like to get to call a couple of plates for  Browns, and open doors for women in coaching. </p><p>Watch this Formula 3 crash, at 171 miles per hour.  17-year-old German,  Sophia Floersch, fractured her spine, fractured a facial bone, suffered  concussion and other lacerations; 170 miles per hour at the Macau Grand  Prix in China.  She says, I'm fine but will go into surgery tomorrow.   NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series championship, Homestead, Miami, 12 laps to  go -- oh, well, this is actually before the race.  The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p>CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p>MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p>CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p>MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p>MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p>MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p>CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p>CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p>MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p>MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p>MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p>CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.  Thank you so much, Jared.   Sports Reports Fox New Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 155.  Still ahead,  Christmas is coming to the White House.  The tree will arrive in Washington  later today.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p> We break it all down.  </p><p> Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p> The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p> In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p> In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p> Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p> Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p> But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p> But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p> And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p> And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p> Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p> Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p> And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p> And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p> And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p> So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p> So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p> So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p> Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p> And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p> So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p> Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p> But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p> Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p> I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p> And second of all -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p> I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p> But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p> And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p> LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p> LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p> LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p> LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p> FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p> LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p> They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p> But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p> I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p> CARTER:  Right.  </p><p> LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p> CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p> And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p> So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p> LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p> But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p> LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p> And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p> But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p> CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p> LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p> These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p> Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p> LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p> LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.  These are some of the names I've  downgraded now.  </p><p> Their revenue forecast for the year because they're not expecting as many  orders coming from Apple, and this isn't first time that Apple's had  problems with launching a new handset.  </p><p> Remember, the iPhone 5c, do you remember?  The cheaper iPhone that they  launched five years ago.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> LI:  A month later, they also cut become on their orders as well because it  wasn't selling as well.</p><p> I think it's a -- it's a reality that there's saturation in the market.   People have the Apples and the handsets that they need.  </p><p> Can you keep selling 200 million plus each and every year?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then that separate chipmaker, the graphics chipmaker,  NVIDIA, it entered a bear market almost in one day.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Has -- it was down 19 percent.</p><p> LI:  But they've had that track record, up crash, up crash over the last  ten years.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They have.  </p><p> I want to move on to American and Chinese trade tensions boiling over at  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  </p><p> China reportedly upset of the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly  singling out their trade practices.</p><p> This was the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in  which the parties did not issue a communique.  James, your reaction to  this.</p><p> How much should we read into this issue?  Again, it made the front page of  \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Oh, boy.  \"Summit Breaks Amid Trade Tensions.\"</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p> So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p> LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p> I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p> CARTER:  For sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.  The final Florida  Election results are in.  Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p> Good morning, Griff.</p><p> GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p> You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p> She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p> Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  A public office is a public trust.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JENKINS:  That public trust now in the hands of Senator-elect Rick Scott.   He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p> \"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p> In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p> Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p> One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p> CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p> CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p> CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p> So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p> So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p> CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p> Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p> LI:  There you go.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p> Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p> We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p> Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p> A full roundup, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p> A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p> Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p> Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p> Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p> The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p> So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p> President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p> Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p> But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p> Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p> JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.  It has to be you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald brought in  $16 million, but that makes it the lowest total ever for an opening weekend  in the Harry Potter franchise.  </p><p> These movies were spinoff of Harry Potter and it was filmed with 16 percent  below their 2016 opening weekend, the first version of this one.</p><p> Last week's box office winner, Doctor Seuss' The Grinch brought in just  over $38 million.  </p><p> And rounding up the top five, Bohemian Rhapsody, that's the Queen movie.   New release, Instant Family, and Widows rounding out your numbers, Dagen,  and those are your headlines.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p> LI:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p> LI:  Thank you.</p><p> Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p> Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p> He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p> There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p> And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p> And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p> Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p> ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p> So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p> KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p> Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p> JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p> I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p> And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p> I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p> And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p> So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p> FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p> Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p> The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p> So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p> Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p> But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p> I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p> And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p> The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p> Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p> Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p> With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p> And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p> And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p> I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p> HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p> We'll tell you more.  </p><p> And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p> Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p> More ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p> In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p> Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p> From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p> We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p> To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p> Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p> RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p> And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p> And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p> No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p> Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p> And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p> FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p> But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p> Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p> MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p> But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p> I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p> I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p> So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p> CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p> And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p> MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p> And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p> And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p> I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p> LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p> MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p> LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p> MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p> You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p> Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p> MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p> MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.  And Hollywood magic, coming to YouTube, video-sharing sites new  venture into streaming, free, future link flicks.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Saudi Arabia's King Salman, delivering a speech on foreign  policy this morning.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, Dagen.  King Salman bin Abdulaziz, is giving his first public  address since the killing of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi,  after embarking on a nationwide tour with his son, the Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman.  U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.  I know  exactly, I know everything that went on where that happened -- </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, the crowned prince has continuously denied his involvement  in Khashoggi's murder.  </p><p> Well, General Electric reportedly facing a dilemma in Iraq, as the company  seeks power sales.  The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.  The report advises G.E. to distance himself  from at least one of its contracts there.  G.E. is competing with Germany's  Siemens for multi-billion-dollar new power contracts throughout that  country.  Shares of G.E. are lower in the pre-market, a quarter of a  percent right now.  </p><p> Well YouTube is now streaming full length movies for free.  But, of course,  there's a catch because nothing is free, right?  To enjoy them, you've got  to endure advertisements that support the movie.  But if you are willing to  pay to be a YouTube premium subscriber the ads go away.  Movies so far  include \"Rocky,\" \"Zookeeper,\" and \"Legally Blonde\" among other.  Shares of  Google parent company, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, up about one percent  so far this year, Dagen.  And there you go, another way to stream content.   Like number 50.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I hooked my dad with streaming his ACC games or his  University of Virginia games.</p><p> CASONE:  Nice, that's important.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a -- that was a long row, so to speak.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, the teaching moments with our parents can be interesting  sometimes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, dreams of Coach Condi; why  Condoleezza Rice says that she will not be coaching Cleveland Browns.  More  sports, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A lot of drama in NFL yesterday.  Jared Max is here with all of  your sports highlights.  Hey, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  There were  three walk off wins on last second field goals by the Broncos, the Cowboys  and the Raiders.  Last minute comeback went for the Steelers -- how about  the Vikings last night?  First place, Bears were up 14-0.  They were  leading 14-6 when Chicago's Eddy Jackson intercepted Kirk Cousins, brought  it in for a touchdown.  Chicago led 20-6, now, the bear were leading 25-20.   Two minutes to go, Minnesota after a touchdown tries an onside kick, but  the Bears recovering.  Chicago wins, now 7-3 way to off the NFC north.  </p><p> 33 years to the day since legendary Washington Redskins Quarterback Joe  Theismann suffered a career-ending injury -- he was at the Skins' game  Sunday, where the team's current quarterback, Alex Smith suffered identical  injuries that Theismann did.  Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p> Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.   Though, she said she would like to get to call a couple of plates for  Browns, and open doors for women in coaching. </p><p> Watch this Formula 3 crash, at 171 miles per hour.  17-year-old German,  Sophia Floersch, fractured her spine, fractured a facial bone, suffered  concussion and other lacerations; 170 miles per hour at the Macau Grand  Prix in China.  She says, I'm fine but will go into surgery tomorrow.   NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series championship, Homestead, Miami, 12 laps to  go -- oh, well, this is actually before the race.  The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p> MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p> CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p> MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p> MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p> CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p> MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p> MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p> MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p> CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p> MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p> CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p> MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p> MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p> MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p> CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.  Thank you so much, Jared.   Sports Reports Fox New Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 155.  Still ahead,  Christmas is coming to the White House.  The tree will arrive in Washington  later today.  Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p>We break it all down.  </p><p>Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p>The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p>In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p>In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p>Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p>But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p>But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p>And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p>And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p>Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p>Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p>And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p>And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p>And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p>So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p>So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p>So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p>Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p>And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p>So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p>Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p>But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p>Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p>I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p>And second of all -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p>I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p>But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p>And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p>LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p>LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p>LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p>LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p>They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p>But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p>I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p>CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p>And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p>So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p>LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p>But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p>LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p>And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p>But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p>CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p>These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p>Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p>LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.  These are some of the names I've  downgraded now.  </p><p>Their revenue forecast for the year because they're not expecting as many  orders coming from Apple, and this isn't first time that Apple's had  problems with launching a new handset.  </p><p>Remember, the iPhone 5c, do you remember?  The cheaper iPhone that they  launched five years ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  A month later, they also cut become on their orders as well because it  wasn't selling as well.</p><p>I think it's a -- it's a reality that there's saturation in the market.   People have the Apples and the handsets that they need.  </p><p>Can you keep selling 200 million plus each and every year?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then that separate chipmaker, the graphics chipmaker,  NVIDIA, it entered a bear market almost in one day.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Has -- it was down 19 percent.</p><p>LI:  But they've had that track record, up crash, up crash over the last  ten years.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They have.  </p><p>I want to move on to American and Chinese trade tensions boiling over at  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  </p><p>China reportedly upset of the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly  singling out their trade practices.</p><p>This was the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in  which the parties did not issue a communique.  James, your reaction to  this.</p><p>How much should we read into this issue?  Again, it made the front page of  \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Oh, boy.  \"Summit Breaks Amid Trade Tensions.\"</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p>So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p>LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p>I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>CARTER:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.  The final Florida  Election results are in.  Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p>She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p>Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  A public office is a public trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  That public trust now in the hands of Senator-elect Rick Scott.   He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p>\"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p>In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p>Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p>One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p>CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p>CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p>So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p>Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p>LI:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p>We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p>Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p>A full roundup, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p>A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p>Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p>Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p>Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p>The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p>So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p>President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p>But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p>Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p>JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.  It has to be you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald brought in  $16 million, but that makes it the lowest total ever for an opening weekend  in the Harry Potter franchise.  </p><p>These movies were spinoff of Harry Potter and it was filmed with 16 percent  below their 2016 opening weekend, the first version of this one.</p><p>Last week's box office winner, Doctor Seuss' The Grinch brought in just  over $38 million.  </p><p>And rounding up the top five, Bohemian Rhapsody, that's the Queen movie.   New release, Instant Family, and Widows rounding out your numbers, Dagen,  and those are your headlines.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p>Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p>He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p>There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p>And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p>And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p>Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p>ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p>So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p>Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p>I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p>And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p>I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p>And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p>So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p>Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p>The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p>So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p>Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p>But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p>I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p>And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p>The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p>Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p>Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p>With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p>And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p>And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p>I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p>We'll tell you more.  </p><p>And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p>Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p>More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p>In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p>Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p>From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p>We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p>Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p>RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p>And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p>And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p>No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p>Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p>And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p>But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p>Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p>But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p>I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p>I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p>CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p>And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p>And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p>And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p>I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p>LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p>MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p>You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p>Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p>MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.

King Salman bin Abdulaziz, is giving his first public  address since the killing of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi,  after embarking on a nationwide tour with his son, the Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman.  U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.  I know  exactly, I know everything that went on where that happened -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the crowned prince has continuously denied his involvement  in Khashoggi's murder.  </p><p>Well, General Electric reportedly facing a dilemma in Iraq, as the company  seeks power sales.  The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.  The report advises G.E. to distance himself  from at least one of its contracts there.  G.E. is competing with Germany's  Siemens for multi-billion-dollar new power contracts throughout that  country.  Shares of G.E. are lower in the pre-market, a quarter of a  percent right now.  </p><p>Well YouTube is now streaming full length movies for free.  But, of course,  there's a catch because nothing is free, right?  To enjoy them, you've got  to endure advertisements that support the movie.  But if you are willing to  pay to be a YouTube premium subscriber the ads go away.  Movies so far  include \"Rocky,\" \"Zookeeper,\" and \"Legally Blonde\" among other.  Shares of  Google parent company, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, up about one percent  so far this year, Dagen.  And there you go, another way to stream content.

Hey, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  There were  three walk off wins on last second field goals by the Broncos, the Cowboys  and the Raiders.  Last minute comeback went for the Steelers -- how about  the Vikings last night?  First place, Bears were up 14-0.  They were  leading 14-6 when Chicago's Eddy Jackson intercepted Kirk Cousins, brought  it in for a touchdown.  Chicago led 20-6, now, the bear were leading 25-20.   Two minutes to go, Minnesota after a touchdown tries an onside kick, but  the Bears recovering.  Chicago wins, now 7-3 way to off the NFC north.  </p><p>33 years to the day since legendary Washington Redskins Quarterback Joe  Theismann suffered a career-ending injury -- he was at the Skins' game  Sunday, where the team's current quarterback, Alex Smith suffered identical  injuries that Theismann did.  Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p>Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.

The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p>CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p>MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p>CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p>MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p>MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p>MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p>CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p>CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p>MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p>MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p>MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p>CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.  Thank you so much, Jared.   Sports Reports Fox New Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 155.  Still ahead,  Christmas is coming to the White House.  The tree will arrive in Washington  later today.  Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top story at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.  Rising trade  tensions with China.  Vice President Mike Pence back from the Asia Pacific  summit without an accord.  Now, the focus shifts to the g-20 summit next  week where President Trump is set to meet with China's President Xi. </p><p>The futures are under this pressure this morning, coming off a week of  losses, and 85-point loss on the Dow Futures.

Good to see you Cheryl and Lauren. I'll see you both.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about? Everything's settled in Florida. That's one of the top stories that we will get to this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everybody. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, November 19th. Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he says it is coming. And the tech giant unite is already struggling with orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p>We break it all down.</p><p>Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board. A 48-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.</p><p>The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week. The S&amp;P 500 shedding 1.6 percent.</p><p>In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although slight but green in England, France, and Germany.</p><p>In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well. No red in Asia. The biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise. Vice President Mike Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without an accord.</p><p>Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: China wants to make a deal. They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large list, and just not acceptable to me yet.</p><p>But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to China. I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for China.</p><p>But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We look at what is at stake straight ahead.</p><p>And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker. The company looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for alleged financial violations. We will dig into that story.</p><p>And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking it out with The Grinch in theaters. We'll tell you who took the top spot.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.</p><p>Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network. \"The Wall Street Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter. Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's settle. We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from now with a hit from Florida.</p><p>Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right. So that's a Republican pick up.</p><p>And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now conceded. You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a battle of lawyers.</p><p>And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two years from now. Can Florida get its act together?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I -- this has been going on forever. You look at especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.</p><p>And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize performance or --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.</p><p>So we will discuss that. I'll give you a breath to let you collect your thoughts.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p>So, I think you need some kind of standard.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in --</p><p>FREEMAN: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- in the early 2000s.</p><p>So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to -- he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p>Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of regulation. I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p>And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Susan, your reaction to that.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: I would say it's easy for Tim Cook to say, isn't it? Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p>So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social media, doesn't that help his position as well?</p><p>Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point? So, I think it's easy for him to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what do you make of this? Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.</p><p>But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies are facing.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think consumers should be very skeptical here. Is this a play where he thinks his business model will do better under regulation --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in some arenas?</p><p>Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe he sees an advantage.</p><p>I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better than government.</p><p>And second of all --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- people want free services. So, to say it's a failure that people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p>I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a different trade.</p><p>But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York Times article about Facebook.</p><p>And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink. Welcome to the party.\"</p><p>LI: Yes, it's not --</p><p>MCDOWELL: \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p>LI: Not a surprise for anybody, really.</p><p>MCDOWELL: \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information about yourself.</p><p>LI: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p>LI: Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" over the weekend.</p><p>FREEMAN: You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: What do you think is happening?</p><p>LI: Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from you for -- from Instagram.</p><p>They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p>But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of tech.</p><p>I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Right.</p><p>LI: -- D Live event and --</p><p>FREEMAN: Uh-hmm.</p><p>LI: -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>LI: If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p>CARTER: But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy, with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way. We better be prepared for it.\"</p><p>And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.</p><p>So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p>LI: I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put it that way.</p><p>But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that they're in right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple pushing back on the FBI when --</p><p>LI: San Bernardino?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help. Essentially right code so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.</p><p>And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very beginning.</p><p>But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p>CARTER: Very different.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser extent --</p><p>LI: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- because of the Android operating system.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Just -- and it could be just a business model question. Ii think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply a fundamental belief.</p><p>These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable to certain regulation than others.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: So, I would say consumer beware.</p><p>Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.</p><p>LI: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain, suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple?</p><p>LI: I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo. These are some of the names I've downgraded now.</p><p>Their revenue forecast for the year because they're not expecting as many orders coming from Apple, and this isn't first time that Apple's had problems with launching a new handset.</p><p>Remember, the iPhone 5c, do you remember? The cheaper iPhone that they launched five years ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>LI: A month later, they also cut become on their orders as well because it wasn't selling as well.</p><p>I think it's a -- it's a reality that there's saturation in the market. People have the Apples and the handsets that they need.</p><p>Can you keep selling 200 million plus each and every year?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then that separate chipmaker, the graphics chipmaker, NVIDIA, it entered a bear market almost in one day.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Has -- it was down 19 percent.</p><p>LI: But they've had that track record, up crash, up crash over the last ten years.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They have.</p><p>I want to move on to American and Chinese trade tensions boiling over at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.</p><p>China reportedly upset of the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly singling out their trade practices.</p><p>This was the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in which the parties did not issue a communique. James, your reaction to this.</p><p>How much should we read into this issue? Again, it made the front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\". Oh, boy. \"Summit Breaks Amid Trade Tensions.\"</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Yes. When you want to say that you're going to fight protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would object to that as a goal.</p><p>So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on just hopes that there's a bright --</p><p>LI: They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia Pacific right now,</p><p>I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session. 2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, different president.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right.</p><p>CARTER: For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The recount, meantime, in Florida is over. The final Florida Election results are in. Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER: Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p>She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get to replace her. We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033 votes.</p><p>Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: I was not victorious in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we fought. A public office is a public trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS: That public trust now in the hands of Senator-elect Rick Scott. He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken, and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's success with the entire nation.\"</p><p>\"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across America. It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p>In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty. In a recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a powerful statewide seat. Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Griff.</p><p>Griff Jenkins down in Florida. And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you later in the morning.</p><p>One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter. Rick Scott won 45 percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p>CARTER: Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He lost his spot by just nine percentage points. House Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points. So, that's a very big win for the Republicans and Florida.</p><p>CARTER: It's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p>CARTER: It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.</p><p>So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Exactly.</p><p>So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language website and adds up in Spanish. Nelson had neither.</p><p>CARTER: Oh.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from \"Bloomberg.\"</p><p>Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\" Give everybody credit.</p><p>LI: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There you go.</p><p>Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p>We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p>Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver expected results at the box office.</p><p>A full roundup, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest. Cheryl Casone has the details. Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Big breaking news overnight, Dagen, good morning.</p><p>A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p>Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's Renault.</p><p>Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year. This is a breaking story. We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.</p><p>Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in Northern California.</p><p>The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p>So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p>President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend, meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.</p><p>Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for firefighters across Northern California.</p><p>But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p>Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend. A Harry Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDDIE REDMAYNE: So you're asking me to help hunt him down?</p><p>JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald. It has to be you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: The sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald brought in $16 million, but that makes it the lowest total ever for an opening weekend in the Harry Potter franchise.</p><p>These movies were spinoff of Harry Potter and it was filmed with 16 percent below their 2016 opening weekend, the first version of this one.</p><p>Last week's box office winner, Doctor Seuss' The Grinch brought in just over $38 million.</p><p>And rounding up the top five, Bohemian Rhapsody, that's the Queen movie. New release, Instant Family, and Widows rounding out your numbers, Dagen, and those are your headlines. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos Ghosn news because --</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- Susan, you've interviewed him. You understand probably Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in business news. So --</p><p>LI: Thank you.</p><p>Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.</p><p>Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this lightly.</p><p>He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well. Renault, of course, taking over Nissan. He only stepped down as CEO last year and I would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.</p><p>There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up. It's not going to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much for that, Susan. We'll discuss that as the morning moves on.</p><p>And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at this weekend's Macau Grand Prix. That story is coming up.</p><p>And we check on oil. Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a historic losing streak.</p><p>Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on Friday and he weighed in on the decline.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Is oil an indicator that it is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?</p><p>ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE: There is worry that maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.</p><p>So, this is why you're seeing the volatility. I would tell you from here I still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>KAPLAN: You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. OK.</p><p>KAPLAN: And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.</p><p>Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you. Where do you -- where do you think oil goes from here in the short run?</p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL: I think in the short run, it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.</p><p>I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long.</p><p>And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.</p><p>I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p>And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p>So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p>FREEMAN: John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal. I want to ask you about the Permian. We heard on the show last week that the bottlenecks are largely easing.</p><p>Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p>The -- in principle, I agree. The issues, the logistics issues, are being solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.</p><p>So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Namely the insecurity that's always been there.</p><p>But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the first half of 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?</p><p>I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one particular pipeline.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p>And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China. And so it has played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p><p>The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA, it's about $0.10 higher than the price.</p><p>Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p>Does this help consumers? Certainly people pay attention to falling gas prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Well, absolutely. President Trump has had a direct hand in all of this, you know.</p><p>With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the availability of gasoline.</p><p>And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where storage number have gone up</p><p>And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p>I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Love it. John Hofmeister.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much for being here. Take care, John. We'll see you soon. Coming up.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Corruption concerns at General Electric. More dilemmas piling up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p>We'll tell you more.</p><p>And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence. This weekend's NASCAR, the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p>Who won the championship? He was driving a Ford.</p><p>More ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington and Beijing. The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into negative territory on the week.</p><p>In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week. The markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board in England, France, and Germany, this Monday. In Asia, markets closing higher overnight. We have gains across the board there.</p><p>Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing company ahead.</p><p>From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was reportedly considered for an interview. And I want to start this rumor, how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p>We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized. That car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to show you -- she survived that accident. We'll bring you more. We'll bring you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the House Financial Services Committee. She is set to take over as chair of that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the House.</p><p>Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good to see you. What do you make of this report? And what Maxine Waters running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be there?</p><p>RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.: Well, elections have consequences and here you go. This is something Maxine Waters actually have been talking about for quite some time. She's totally going to rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p>And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal activity.</p><p>And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks, especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship 20 plus years ago with President Trump. And so, she wants to bring in all of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p>No one really should be surprised. Everyone new Maxine Waters will be Financial Services Chair. I don't think anybody in business thought it would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are. And so, she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p>Is it good for the markets? No. Of course, the only issue is she's obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of investigations and a lot of subpoenas.</p><p>And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee would be a home for investigations. I think that's what we're going to see under Chairman Waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL: James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's right. And I think for her, the play is going to be looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the President's part.</p><p>But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the investigative piece. She also has the ability to try to embarrass administration officials in hearings.</p><p>Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences she has with administration regulations?</p><p>MEYER: Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic. I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work across the aisle. And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing that. And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some productivity there.</p><p>But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans, whether that a restaurant or a public place. I mean, I don't really think she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be productive.</p><p>I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the headlines, to try to stay relevant. And frankly, I think it's something that President Trump is welcoming. I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he wants Chairman Waters.</p><p>I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his base for 2020. Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think it's good for our markets? Absolutely not, but it's good for President Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p>CARTER: to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p>And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p>MEYER: Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p>And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you know, consumer protections. But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p>And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President Trump. And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two years of really chaotic politics.</p><p>I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest with you. I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy politics, right? And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy politics, right? And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p>LI: And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because --</p><p>MEYER: Absolutely.</p><p>LI: Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p>MEYER: I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>MEYER: And so, what does that tell you? I mean, I think a lot of us here have Wells Fargo accounts. Doesn't that make you feel a little uncomfortable? It makes me feel a little uncomfortable. My mortgage is through Wells Fargo. I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p>You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p>Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not. If you're from a deep blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p>MEYER: Yes. I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House, and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans to have these two in leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that show more maturity than the people who work in Washington. Ron --</p><p>MEYER: Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer. Coming up, a horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is coming up. And Hollywood magic, coming to YouTube, video-sharing sites new venture into streaming, free, future link flicks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Saudi Arabia's King Salman, delivering a speech on foreign policy this morning. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Dagen. King Salman bin Abdulaziz, is giving his first public address since the killing of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, after embarking on a nationwide tour with his son, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered Khashoggi's killing. On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: It's a suffering tape. It is a terrible tape. I've been fully briefed on it. There's no reason for me to hear it. Like I said to the people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason. I know exactly, I know everything that went on where that happened --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, the crowned prince has continuously denied his involvement in Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>Well, General Electric reportedly facing a dilemma in Iraq, as the company seeks power sales. The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their key business partners in Iraq. The report advises G.E. to distance himself from at least one of its contracts there. G.E. is competing with Germany's Siemens for multi-billion-dollar new power contracts throughout that country. Shares of G.E. are lower in the pre-market, a quarter of a percent right now.</p><p>Well YouTube is now streaming full length movies for free. But, of course, there's a catch because nothing is free, right? To enjoy them, you've got to endure advertisements that support the movie. But if you are willing to pay to be a YouTube premium subscriber the ads go away. Movies so far include \"Rocky,\" \"Zookeeper,\" and \"Legally Blonde\" among other. Shares of Google parent company, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, up about one percent so far this year, Dagen. And there you go, another way to stream content. Like number 50.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I hooked my dad with streaming his ACC games or his University of Virginia games.</p><p>CASONE: Nice, that's important.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was a -- that was a long row, so to speak.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, the teaching moments with our parents can be interesting sometimes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, dreams of Coach Condi; why Condoleezza Rice says that she will not be coaching Cleveland Browns. More sports, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A lot of drama in NFL yesterday. Jared Max is here with all of your sports highlights. Hey, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Hey, Dagen. There were three walk off wins on last second field goals by the Broncos, the Cowboys and the Raiders. Last minute comeback went for the Steelers -- how about the Vikings last night? First place, Bears were up 14-0. They were leading 14-6 when Chicago's Eddy Jackson intercepted Kirk Cousins, brought it in for a touchdown. Chicago led 20-6, now, the bear were leading 25-20. Two minutes to go, Minnesota after a touchdown tries an onside kick, but the Bears recovering. Chicago wins, now 7-3 way to off the NFC north.</p><p>33 years to the day since legendary Washington Redskins Quarterback Joe Theismann suffered a career-ending injury -- he was at the Skins' game Sunday, where the team's current quarterback, Alex Smith suffered identical injuries that Theismann did. Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down for season. From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like mine. I feel so bad for him.\" While Theismann by sacked by all-time great Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said: \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it. Never want to see that for anyone ever. Wishing you all the best brother.\" Like the Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21. Same thing but this time, the Redskins lost.</p><p>Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for their head coaching job. It's not actually happening. The Browns said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it. Though, she said she would like to get to call a couple of plates for Browns, and open doors for women in coaching.</p><p>Watch this Formula 3 crash, at 171 miles per hour. 17-year-old German, Sophia Floersch, fractured her spine, fractured a facial bone, suffered concussion and other lacerations; 170 miles per hour at the Macau Grand Prix in China. She says, I'm fine but will go into surgery tomorrow. NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series championship, Homestead, Miami, 12 laps to go -- oh, well, this is actually before the race. The parachuter got caught in the catch fence. Late in the race, 12 laps to go. Joey Logano, who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it. He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske Racing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win. The -- that's a Ford car. By the way, I watched it. Not the biggest Logano fan; it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the win. Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row racing. (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J. (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.</p><p>MAX: Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in alphabetical order.</p><p>CARTER: I am, but I have to watch it a few times.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p>MAX: Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great. Saw everything I needed to see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What did you watch sports wise yesterday?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend. And -- sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.</p><p>MAX: Medical -- things have changed so much. Alex Smith, let's hope he gets to come back from this. That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.</p><p>CARTER: 30 years ago.</p><p>MAX: 33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player caused the injury in part on the sack.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?</p><p>MAX: Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super bowl preview, the Saints, though. Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Crushed!</p><p>MAX: They crushed the Eagles. That they've scored 40 points or more in six game this is season, that ties an NFL record. They look like the team to beat at this moment.</p><p>CARTER: Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns? I think that would be a great choice.</p><p>MAX: Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know, she wanted.</p><p>CARTER: I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, she could run the NFL: That's long been -- shoot. Condi Rice could run NASCAR. I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR. There you go.</p><p>MAX: You heard it from her first.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it. Again, icon, I don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea. And flying the flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and (INAUDIBLE) Adams. I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of prison now. Listen to this. It's incredible reporting and if you are -- if you followed that story at all --</p><p>MAX: It's fascinating.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's fascinating. It's like a seven-part series. So --</p><p>MAX: I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother. It's a story of triumph and forgiveness and love. I'm just -- I'm not going to give it all away.</p><p>CARTER: And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years?</p><p>MCDOWELL: 99 is when she Surekha was murdered. Thank you so much, Jared. Sports Reports Fox New Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 155. Still ahead, Christmas is coming to the White House. The tree will arrive in Washington later today. Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, November 19th, your top story at 7:00 a.m. Eastern. Rising trade tensions with China. Vice President Mike Pence back from the Asia Pacific summit without an accord. Now, the focus shifts to the g-20 summit next week where President Trump is set to meet with China's President Xi.</p><p>The futures are under this pressure this morning, coming off a week of losses, and 85-point loss on the Dow Futures.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p>We break it all down.  </p><p>Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p>The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p>In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p>In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p>Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p>But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p>But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p>And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p>And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p>Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p>Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p>And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p>And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p>And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p>So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p>So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p>So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p>Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p>And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p>So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p>Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p>But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p>Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p>I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p>And second of all -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p>I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p>But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p>And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p>LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p>LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p>LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p>LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p>They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p>But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p>I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p>CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p>And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p>So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p>LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p>But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p>LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p>And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p>But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p>CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p>These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p>Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p>LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p>LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.  These are some of the names I've  downgraded now.  </p><p>Their revenue forecast for the year because they're not expecting as many  orders coming from Apple, and this isn't first time that Apple's had  problems with launching a new handset.  </p><p>Remember, the iPhone 5c, do you remember?  The cheaper iPhone that they  launched five years ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>LI:  A month later, they also cut become on their orders as well because it  wasn't selling as well.</p><p>I think it's a -- it's a reality that there's saturation in the market.   People have the Apples and the handsets that they need.  </p><p>Can you keep selling 200 million plus each and every year?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then that separate chipmaker, the graphics chipmaker,  NVIDIA, it entered a bear market almost in one day.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Has -- it was down 19 percent.</p><p>LI:  But they've had that track record, up crash, up crash over the last  ten years.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They have.  </p><p>I want to move on to American and Chinese trade tensions boiling over at  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  </p><p>China reportedly upset of the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly  singling out their trade practices.</p><p>This was the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in  which the parties did not issue a communique.  James, your reaction to  this.</p><p>How much should we read into this issue?  Again, it made the front page of  \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Oh, boy.  \"Summit Breaks Amid Trade Tensions.\"</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p>So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p>LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p>I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>CARTER:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.  The final Florida  Election results are in.  Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p>She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p>Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  A public office is a public trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  That public trust now in the hands of Senator-elect Rick Scott.   He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p>\"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p>In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p>Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p>One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p>CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p>CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p>So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p>Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p>LI:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p>We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p>Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p>A full roundup, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p>A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p>Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p>Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p>Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p>The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p>So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p>President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p>But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p>Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p>JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.  It has to be you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald brought in  $16 million, but that makes it the lowest total ever for an opening weekend  in the Harry Potter franchise.  </p><p>These movies were spinoff of Harry Potter and it was filmed with 16 percent  below their 2016 opening weekend, the first version of this one.</p><p>Last week's box office winner, Doctor Seuss' The Grinch brought in just  over $38 million.  </p><p>And rounding up the top five, Bohemian Rhapsody, that's the Queen movie.   New release, Instant Family, and Widows rounding out your numbers, Dagen,  and those are your headlines.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p>Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p>He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p>There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p>And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p>And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p>Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p>ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p>So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p>KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p>Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p>I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p>And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p>I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p>And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p>So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p>Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p>The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p>So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p>Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p>But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p>I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p>And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p>The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p>Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p>Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p>With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p>And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p>And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p>I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p>HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p>We'll tell you more.  </p><p>And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p>Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p>More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p>In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p>Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p>From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p>We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p>Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p>RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p>And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p>And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p>No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p>Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p>And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p>But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p>Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p>But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p>I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p>I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p>CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p>And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p>And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p>And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p>I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p>LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p>MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p>You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p>Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p>MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p>MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.

King Salman bin Abdulaziz, is giving his first public  address since the killing of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi,  after embarking on a nationwide tour with his son, the Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman.  U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.  I know  exactly, I know everything that went on where that happened -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the crowned prince has continuously denied his involvement  in Khashoggi's murder.  </p><p>Well, General Electric reportedly facing a dilemma in Iraq, as the company  seeks power sales.  The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.  The report advises G.E. to distance himself  from at least one of its contracts there.  G.E. is competing with Germany's  Siemens for multi-billion-dollar new power contracts throughout that  country.  Shares of G.E. are lower in the pre-market, a quarter of a  percent right now.  </p><p>Well YouTube is now streaming full length movies for free.  But, of course,  there's a catch because nothing is free, right?  To enjoy them, you've got  to endure advertisements that support the movie.  But if you are willing to  pay to be a YouTube premium subscriber the ads go away.  Movies so far  include \"Rocky,\" \"Zookeeper,\" and \"Legally Blonde\" among other.  Shares of  Google parent company, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, up about one percent  so far this year, Dagen.  And there you go, another way to stream content.

Hey, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  There were  three walk off wins on last second field goals by the Broncos, the Cowboys  and the Raiders.  Last minute comeback went for the Steelers -- how about  the Vikings last night?  First place, Bears were up 14-0.  They were  leading 14-6 when Chicago's Eddy Jackson intercepted Kirk Cousins, brought  it in for a touchdown.  Chicago led 20-6, now, the bear were leading 25-20.   Two minutes to go, Minnesota after a touchdown tries an onside kick, but  the Bears recovering.  Chicago wins, now 7-3 way to off the NFC north.  </p><p>33 years to the day since legendary Washington Redskins Quarterback Joe  Theismann suffered a career-ending injury -- he was at the Skins' game  Sunday, where the team's current quarterback, Alex Smith suffered identical  injuries that Theismann did.  Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p>Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.

The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p>CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p>MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p>CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p>MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p>MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p>MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p>CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p>MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p>CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p>MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p>MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p>MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p>CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.  Thank you so much, Jared.   Sports Reports Fox New Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 155.  Still ahead,  Christmas is coming to the White House.  The tree will arrive in Washington  later today.  Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top story at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.  Rising trade  tensions with China.  Vice President Mike Pence back from the Asia Pacific  summit without an accord.  Now, the focus shifts to the g-20 summit next  week where President Trump is set to meet with China's President Xi. </p><p>The futures are under this pressure this morning, coming off a week of  losses, and 85-point loss on the Dow Futures.

Good to see  you Cheryl and Lauren.  I'll see you both.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> If you hear people talking, guess what we're talking about?  Everything's  settled in Florida.  That's one of the top stories that we will get to this  morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th.  Your top stories at the 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tough times for Apple. CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation, but he  says it is coming.  And the tech giant unite is already struggling with  orders for its new phone and suppliers are paying the price.</p><p> We break it all down.  </p><p> Meantime, futures are showing weakness across the board.  A 48-point loss  on the Dow Futures right now, as we move into, or begin this shortened  holiday week, this after a week of red for all the major market indicators.  </p><p> The Dow and NASDAQ both off more than two percent last week.  The S&amp;P 500  shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p> In Europe, to start this week, we have gains across the board, although  slight but green in England, France, and Germany.  </p><p> In Asian markets, finishing higher overnight as well.  No red in Asia.  The  biggest winner there, the Shanghai up almost one percent.</p><p> Nevertheless, trade tensions with China on the rise.  Vice President Mike  Pence returning from the Asia Pacific Summit without a communique, without  an accord.  </p><p> Now the focus shifts to the G20 where President Trump is set to meet with  President Xi next week, but President Trump speaking out about the  difficulty of coming to an agreement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  China wants to make a deal.   They sent a list of things that they're willing to do, which was a large  list, and just not acceptable to me yet.  </p><p> But at some point, I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to  China.  I have a great respect for President Xi, I have a great respect for  China.</p><p> But China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We look at what is at stake straight ahead. </p><p> And breaking news on Nissan, trouble for the automaker.  The company  looking to remove Chairman, Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Japan's NHK news service reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for  alleged financial violations.  We will dig into that story.  </p><p> And a magical weekend at the box office, the Fantastic Beasts sequel duking  it out with The Grinch in theaters.  We'll tell you who took the top spot.  </p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p> Our very own Susan Li from the Fox Business Network.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Pollster and  Maslansky + Partners President, Lee Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So it was James talking before the show started on Florida's  settle.  We got Griff Jenkins coming up in about six, seven minutes from  now with a hit from Florida.</p><p> Close call election, the Editorial Page wrote about it this morning, but  Rick Scott is the Senator from Florida.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's right.  So that's a Republican  pick up.  </p><p> And I think good for the country that the losers in that race have now  conceded.  You hate to have a replay of that 2000 drama where it becomes a  battle of lawyers.  </p><p> And this one, fortunately, was decided by voters.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And also -- but it does kind of set the stage for two  years from now.  Can Florida get its act together?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I -- this has been going on forever.  You look at  especially in Palm Beach, I think 2002, '04, '06, 2016, and then earlier  this summer with the primary continuing problems following the law.  </p><p> And I would say high-time for the state government to prioritize  performance or -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And there is, and we'll get to this as well, but the Broward  Country Election Chief, there's -- there are reports out there that Brenda  Snipes has resigned amid the recount effort down in Florida.  </p><p> So we will discuss that.  I'll give you a breath to let you collect your  thoughts.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  You know, I think what you want is maybe some legislation  at the state level as well because you recall Snipes' predecessor wasn't so  hot either, got fired for similar problems.</p><p> So, I think you need some kind of standard.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  She was initially selected by Governor Jeb Bush in -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  That's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- in the early 2000s.  </p><p> So we'll get -- we'll get into that whole story, but we want to get to --  he said regulation, but we're talking about a different type of regulation.</p><p> Coming to big tech, Apple CEO Tim Cook issuing a warning on what he  believes to be the inevitable arrival of regulation in Silicon Valley.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation.  I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market's not working and it hasn't worked here.</p><p> And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Susan, your reaction to that.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I would say it's easy for  Tim Cook to say, isn't it?  Because he doesn't deal when it comes to data  as other people like the Facebook and social media players.</p><p> So, some would say that he's probably able to lob stones at glasshouses at  this point, and, you know, with him looking at regulation over social  media, doesn't that help his position as well?  </p><p> Doesn't it strengthen Apple at this point?  So, I think it's easy for him  to say.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They've used that certainly as a marketing too, James, but what  do you make of this?  Because, again, it's possible -- we've talked about  this for -- literally I've been talking about it for years, that they need  to come up with some sort of self-regulatory system within technology.  </p><p> But now that you've had these -- Facebook, Google, falling flat on their  face, not doing a great job if they even decided to show up in front of  Congress that this is a really tricky situation that technology companies  are facing.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, I think Susan raises a great question, is -- I think  consumers should be very skeptical here.  Is this a play where he thinks  his business model will do better under regulation -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- than say a Facebook or a Google that Apple competes with in  some arenas?  </p><p> Yes, Apple has a services business, but they are a hardware company, maybe  he sees an advantage.</p><p> I just -- I just think this statement that this is a market failure, first  of all, markets don't have to work perfectly, they just have to work better  than government.  </p><p> And second of all -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- people want free services.  So, to say it's a failure that  people have tolerated years and years of trading personal information for  lots of services, I is a mistake.</p><p> I think people, for better or worse, have enjoyed a lot of the free stuff  they've gotten from Silicon Valley, and, you know, maybe they'd like a  different trade.  </p><p> But I don't think that government --- I'd be very worried about a  government program that ends up advantaging incumbents, like Apple, as it - - </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- usually does and prevents new competitor.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I had this conversation with someone who works in the  technology industry over the last five years days or so about the New York  Times article about Facebook.  </p><p> And the individual's response was, \"Grab a drink.  Welcome to the party.\"</p><p> LI:  Yes, it's not -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \"Where have you been the last -- \"</p><p> LI:  Not a surprise for anybody, really.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \" -- the last 10 years of Facebook's life, literally.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That Facebook -- if you used Facebook over the years, they  constantly ask you for more and more and more granular personal information  about yourself.  </p><p> LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then you sit and go, \"Wow, it's free.\"</p><p> LI:  Well, I mean there's a -- there's a great article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" over the weekend. </p><p> FREEMAN:  You're (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you think is happening?  </p><p> LI:  Yes, that says basically the reason Instagram founders left is because  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, he wanted to extract more information from  you for -- from Instagram.  </p><p> They wanted to know your location and the Instagram founders are like,  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not what we signed up for.\"</p><p> But I think inevitability, that is the -- basically the signal from all of  tech.  </p><p> I was at the Laguna Beach, WSJ -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> LI:  -- D Live event and -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> LI:  -- everybody understands that this is a new reality.  </p><p> CARTER:  Right.  </p><p> LI:  If you don't, if you're not prepared for it, you shouldn't be CEO.</p><p> CARTER:  But I also think that, you know, if you look at what's happening  in Europe, too, a lot of people are saying, \"You know what, with privacy,  with all of these kinds of concerns out there, we're going that way.  We  better be prepared for it.\" </p><p> And Tim Cook is in a unique position to talk about privacy because let's  not forget, Apple has had a hard line on what privacy means and how you're  not going to access anything that's on there, you know, on there.  </p><p> So I think they think this is going to make them more popular because they  are all about privacy and everybody else in social media maybe isn't, so.</p><p> LI:  I don't know that they're all about privacy willingly, let's just put  it that way.  </p><p> But I think they see this as a -- probably a position of strength that  they're in right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She's referring to the Apple -- and I was very critical of Apple  pushing back on the FBI when -- </p><p> LI:  San Bernardino?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, when the FBI wanted Apple to help.  Essentially right code  so they could access the -- one of the terrorists, the murderer's phones  and Apple pushed back on that in the courts.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I was critical of them, but again that was the line.  </p><p> And this is really -- this is a stance that Steve Jobs took from the very  beginning.</p><p> But these are different -- they are different businesses.</p><p> CARTER:  Very different.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Facebook and Google are different -- well, Google, to a lesser  extent -- </p><p> LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- because of the Android operating system.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they're in the device business indirectly, but again, it's - - Tim Cook is throwing some shade.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just -- and it could be just a business model question.  Ii  think you ought to be skeptical when you hear it as -- presented as simply  a fundamental belief. </p><p> These companies have different models and some of them are more vulnerable  to certain regulation than others. </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  So, I would say consumer beware. </p><p> Big tech, big government deal I think is not in our interest.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get Susan's reaction to this really quickly.  </p><p> LI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Apple suppliers are reportedly facing trouble with lower than  expected demand for the new iPhones.</p><p>Apple's decision to offer more models, part of the problem.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal reporting that it's rippling into the supply chain,  suppliers are suffering, is this a bigger problem for the -- tech for the - -for Apple? </p><p> LI:  I think it's a reality that the demand for the new iPhones is not as  robust as expected, so Lumentum, Qorvo.  These are some of the names I've  downgraded now.  </p><p> Their revenue forecast for the year because they're not expecting as many  orders coming from Apple, and this isn't first time that Apple's had  problems with launching a new handset.  </p><p> Remember, the iPhone 5c, do you remember?  The cheaper iPhone that they  launched five years ago.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> LI:  A month later, they also cut become on their orders as well because it  wasn't selling as well.</p><p> I think it's a -- it's a reality that there's saturation in the market.   People have the Apples and the handsets that they need.  </p><p> Can you keep selling 200 million plus each and every year?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then that separate chipmaker, the graphics chipmaker,  NVIDIA, it entered a bear market almost in one day.  </p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Has -- it was down 19 percent.</p><p> LI:  But they've had that track record, up crash, up crash over the last  ten years.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They have.  </p><p> I want to move on to American and Chinese trade tensions boiling over at  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.  </p><p> China reportedly upset of the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly  singling out their trade practices.</p><p> This was the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in  which the parties did not issue a communique.  James, your reaction to  this.</p><p> How much should we read into this issue?  Again, it made the front page of  \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Oh, boy.  \"Summit Breaks Amid Trade Tensions.\"</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  When you want to say that you're going to fight  protectionism and unfair trade practices, I don't know why anybody would  object to that as a goal.</p><p> So, maybe this says a little something about the good faith or lack  therefore that they are bringing to these upcoming discussions.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We will dig into that because it has -- potentially has an  immediate market reaction because you saw last week what the market did on  just hopes that there's a bright -- </p><p> LI:  They call it chaos at APEC, that's what they're saying in the Asia  Pacific right now,</p><p> I hosted APEC in 2014, I would say it was very cordial during that session.   2018, four years on, a little bit different.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, different president.</p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p> CARTER:  For sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The recount, meantime, in Florida is over.  The final Florida  Election results are in.  Griff Jenkins is in Lauderdale, Florida, with the  very latest.</p><p> Good morning, Griff.</p><p> GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p> You know, after losing 2,000 ballots, missing deadlines, and failing to  report accurate numbers on election night, the Broward County Election  Supervisor, Brenda Snipes, has reportedly resigned according to the \"Sun  Sentinel Newspaper.\"</p><p> She is doing that on January 2nd, and now Governor-Elect DeSantis will get  to replace her.  We'll find out who that will be, but this comes on the  heels of really the big news and that is after 18 year in the Senate, Bill  Nelson conceding in a video statement to Rick Scott after losing by 10,033  votes.  </p><p> Here was Nelson's statement, take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BILL NELSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I was not victorious  in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we  fought.  A public office is a public trust.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JENKINS:  That public trust now in the hands of Senator-elect Rick Scott.   He pins in an op-ed to Fox News, \"Now the voters of Florida have spoken,  and I am honored to serve as our state's next senator and share Florida's  success with the entire nation.\"</p><p> \"With the heated campaign season behind us, it's time for our leads to come  together, roll up their sleeves and get something done for families across  America.  It's time to make Washington work.\"</p><p> In a final note, Dagen, democrats not totally coming up empty.  In a  recount, they picked up the Commissioner for Agriculture seat, which is a  powerful statewide seat.  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Griff.  </p><p> Griff Jenkins down in Florida.  And Griff, hopefully we'll hear from you  later in the morning.  </p><p> One thing I want to bring up really quickly, Lee Carter.  Rick Scott won 45  percent of Latino vote in Florida.</p><p> CARTER:  Wow.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He lost his spot by just nine percentage points.  House  Republicans nationally lost the Latino vote by 40 points.  So, that's a  very big win for the Republicans and Florida.  </p><p> CARTER:  It's a -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And it's a testament to what needs to happen in two years if the  Republicans want to keep the leadership.</p><p> CARTER:  It's a very big win in a -- in a state that has a lot of  immigration, too, and a lot of the Hispanic population.  </p><p> So I think that's something to look at, too, what's so different there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p> So -- and by the way, we should point out Rick Scott had a Spanish language  website and adds up in Spanish.  Nelson had neither.</p><p> CARTER:  Oh.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was according to some of the -- I think reporting from  \"Bloomberg.\"  </p><p> Just to give them credit, \"Bloomberg.\"  Give everybody credit.</p><p> LI:  There you go.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p> Coming up, breaking news, Nissan's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has reportedly  been arrested and questioned in Japan over alleged financial violations.</p><p> We'll tell you more about this developing story.</p><p> Plus not so fantastic beasts, why the Harry Potter magic didn't deliver  expected results at the box office.  </p><p> A full roundup, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Chairman of Nissan reportedly under arrest.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Big breaking news overnight,  Dagen, good morning.  </p><p> A Japanese T.V. station right now is reporting that Nissan Chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, has been now arrested in Tokyo for allegedly violating financial  trading law in that country.</p><p>Nissan also looks like they are set to remove Ghosn as Chairman after  uncovering numerous significant acts of misconduct.</p><p> Ghosn, we should also add, is Chairman and Chief Executive of France's  Renault.  </p><p> Shares of Nissan down nearly 10 percent so far this year.  This is a  breaking story.  We'll get you more details as we them into our newsroom.  </p><p> Now to what's happening back here at home and that devastating wildfire in  Northern California.</p><p> The search for remains of victims is underway as about 1,000 names remain  at a list people unaccounted for.</p><p> So far, at least 77 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire.</p><p> President Trump visited the area to survey the damage over the weekend,  meeting with Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom.  </p><p> Meanwhile, we should add, forecasters say rain could bring some relief for  firefighters across Northern California. </p><p> But there is a risk of flooding in addition to the good news of the rain.</p><p> Well, there was a big winner at the box office over the weekend.  A Harry  Potter spinoff, but the less than fantastic performance still number one.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> EDDIE REDMAYNE:  So you're asking me to help hunt him down?  </p><p> JUDE LAW: I can't move against Grindelwald.  It has to be you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald brought in  $16 million, but that makes it the lowest total ever for an opening weekend  in the Harry Potter franchise.  </p><p> These movies were spinoff of Harry Potter and it was filmed with 16 percent  below their 2016 opening weekend, the first version of this one.</p><p> Last week's box office winner, Doctor Seuss' The Grinch brought in just  over $38 million.  </p><p> And rounding up the top five, Bohemian Rhapsody, that's the Queen movie.   New release, Instant Family, and Widows rounding out your numbers, Dagen,  and those are your headlines.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I want to ask Susan, and James, and lee about this Carlos  Ghosn news because -- </p><p> LI:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- Susan, you've interviewed him.  You understand probably  Japanese business practices and law a lot better than most people in  business news.  So -- </p><p> LI:  Thank you.</p><p> Well, yes, I did -- I have interviewed Carlos Ghosn many time and, you  know, in Japan, it's a very (INAUDIBLE) domestic market so if you're a  foreign CEO and they have found what they call misconduct, which is  underreporting, these are allegations of underreporting his salary.  </p><p> Therefore putting in fraudulent securities documents, they do not take this  lightly.  </p><p> He's also being accused of misusing company funds as well.  Renault, of  course, taking over Nissan.  He only stepped down as CEO last year and I  would say that, you know, they do find these allegations to actually be.  </p><p> There are some, you know, there's evidence to back it up.  It's not going  to be easy for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for that, Susan.  We'll discuss that as the  morning moves on.</p><p> And then this, a teenage Formula Three driver surviving a horrific crash at  this weekend's Macau Grand Prix.  That story is coming up.  </p><p> And we check on oil.  Oil's steady climb, investors are cautious, but the  optimism on the prospect of an OPEC supply cut we'll discuss, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oil prices recovering today, up about $0.18 a barrel after a  historic losing streak.  </p><p> Still lower, however, after falling to one-year low last week, Maria  Bartiromo spoke with Dallas Federal Reserve President, Robert Kaplan, on  Friday and he weighed in on the decline.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Is oil an indicator that it  is indicating that the global economy is slowing down, you know, or is it  just telling us that we've got an oversupply situation?  </p><p> ROBERT KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is worry that  maybe global demand, especially form emerging markets, will slow a bit.  </p><p> So, this is why you're seeing the volatility.  I would tell you from here I  still believe if you go out three to five years, or over the next few  years, we're probably in a fragile equilibrium supply-demand.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> KAPLAN:  You can see a lot of volatility like we've seen, but the fact of  the matter is Shell is going to -- is going to need to grow prolifically to  keep up with global demand and their limits to how fast Shell can grow.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  </p><p> KAPLAN:  And so you still may see some price pressure of the upside, but  this is why you've seen the short-term downdraft. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Former Shell Oil President, John Hofmeister.  </p><p> Mr. Hofmeister, great to see you.  Where do you -- where do you think oil  goes from here in the short run? </p><p> JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL:  I think in the short run,  it's going to hover around where it is now, Dagen.  </p><p> I think the waivers on the Iranian sanctions has had a big impact on the  traders' mentality as to whether oil is, you know, short or long. </p><p> And I -- and I think it's -- there's plenty of oil out there.  </p><p> I think the Saudis are hard-pressed to really cut production in the  aftermath of the Turkey situation.</p><p> And I think the Permian Basin has thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands  of drill, but uncompleted wells which could come online early next year.</p><p> So, I think the -- there's just plenty of supply at the moment.</p><p> FREEMAN:  John, James Freeman here with The Wall Street Journal.  I want to  ask you about the Permian.  We heard on the show last week that the  bottlenecks are largely easing.  </p><p> Can West Texas producers basically respond and make up for whatever cut the  Saudis do manage to persuade on OPEC?</p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Not in '19, I don't think.</p><p> The -- in principle, I agree.  The issues, the logistics issues, are being  solved with new pipelines, but they're not built yet.  </p><p> So, they're not in place, but in addition, there are labor shortages that  have to be reckoned with and a lot of people are just deferring  opportunities in the oil patch for a variety of reasons.  </p><p> Namely the insecurity that's always been there.  </p><p> But I do think they will solve those problems and there will be a point at  which -- exactly what you said will occur, but I don't think that's in the  first half of 2019.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Have the steel tariffs cause problems for the pipeline makers?  </p><p> I know there was some issue about sourcing of the steel used in one  particular pipeline.</p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Well, it's not just the pipeline, it's also the drilling  companies or the operating companies because you have all that steel pipe.</p><p> And a lot of that pipe has historically come out of China.  And so it has  played a role, it has increased costs, and, you know, I think people are  waiting to see what happens in the larger China-U.S. relationship as to  when or how, if ever, that gets fixed.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  John, so gas prices have been sliding, millions of Americans  hitting the roads already for the Thanksgiving holiday.  </p><p> The current national average is $2.62 a gallon, that's according to AAA,  it's about $0.10 higher than the price.  </p><p> Drivers paid last Thanksgiving, but it's notably lower than gas prices were  even a month ago where the average was $2.87.</p><p> Does this help consumers?  Certainly people pay attention to falling gas  prices, but it -- does it really hit them in a positive way?</p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Well, absolutely.  President Trump has had a direct hand in  all of this, you know.  </p><p> With his pressure on Saudi, with his waivers, it has really led to the  availability of gasoline.  </p><p> And if you followed the week-to-week statistics, which I tend to do, we've  had a lot of stored oil in the last four to six weeks in the U.S. where  storage number have gone up</p><p> And refineries haven't really -- haven't really gotten into their shutdown  periods yet so they've been producing a lot of gasoline, so I'd say for the  next month or two, we probably have plenty of gasoline on the market.</p><p> I saw $2.20 a gallon yesterday in Houston.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Love it.  John Hofmeister.  </p><p> HOFMEISTER:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much for being here.  Take care, John.  We'll see  you soon.  Coming up.  </p><p> HOFMEISTER:  You bet.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Corruption concerns at General Electric.  More dilemmas piling  up as the company sinks power sales in Iraq.</p><p> We'll tell you more.  </p><p> And swept away, a skydiver gets snagged in a fence.  This weekend's NASCAR,  the final race of the year, a full sports roundup.</p><p> Who won the championship?  He was driving a Ford.  </p><p> More ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, November 19th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Escalating trade tensions with China, Futures are pointing to a lower open  this morning, as investors watch ongoing negotiations between Washington  and Beijing.  The S&amp;P 500 edging higher on Friday, but it was sleep losses  from earlier in the week that pushed all three major market gauges into  negative territory on the week.</p><p> In Europe, to start a new week is a shortened session this week.  The  markets closed on Thursday here at home, but we have gains across the board  in England, France, and Germany, this Monday.  In Asia, markets closing  higher overnight.  We have gains across the board there.</p><p> Retail in focus, L Brands and Target, reporting this week, ahead of Black  Friday and the holiday shopping season, we break down the expectations  ahead, plus, concerns over General Electric, the shocking report detailing  corruption allegations, against key business partners overseas, and  YouTube's Hollywood debut, the shifting strategy for the video sharing  company ahead.</p><p> From the White House to the football field, why Condoleezza Rice says she  will not be coaching the Cleveland Browns any time soon, after she was  reportedly considered for an interview.  And I want to start this rumor,  how about running NASCAR, Condoleezza Rice?</p><p> We move on to Formula Three, there was a horrible wreck harrowing video  from the Macau Grand Prix, leading to a driver who was hospitalized.  That  car was moving so fast, that we need to really slow that video down, to  show you -- she survived that accident.  We'll bring you more.  We'll bring  you an update on her condition, coming up.</p><p> To our top story this half hour, financial services regulation, looming, a  report from Axios says Congresswoman Maxine Waters is looking to bring  oversight of international financial institutions under the umbrella of the  House Financial Services Committee.  She is set to take over as chair of  that committee under the new Congress, when Democrats take control of the  House.</p><p> Joining me now is Media D.C. Political Analyst Ron Meyer, Ron, always good  to see you.  What do you make of this report?  And what Maxine Waters  running that committee, will do to regulation, what the motive would be  there?</p><p> RON MEYER, POLITICAL ANALYST, MEDIA D.C.:  Well, elections have  consequences and here you go.  This is something Maxine Waters actually  have been talking about for quite some time.  She's totally going to  rearrange the subcommittee structure for this committee.</p><p> And what she's going to do is put the regulation, in oversight, of  basically foreign banks under the same subcommittee as elicit and illegal  activity.</p><p> And so, she's already sort of saying hey, a lot of these foreign banks,  especially she's really targeting Deutsche Bank because of its relationship  20 plus years ago with President Trump.  And so, she wants to bring in all  of this into the subcommittee and really try to stir things up.</p><p> No one really should be surprised.  Everyone new Maxine Waters will be  Financial Services Chair.  I don't think anybody in business thought it  would be particularly good for the marketplace, but here we are.  And so,  she's laying out his plan, she's trying to get her other committee  Democrats on board, and it looks like this is going to advance.</p><p> Is it good for the markets?  No.  Of course, the only issue is she's  obviously not going to be able to get anything passed, that will pass the  Senate and get the President's signature, but what she can do is a lot of  investigations and a lot of subpoenas. </p><p> And so, while you wouldn't really think the financial services committee  would be a home for investigations.  I think that's what we're going to see  under Chairman Waters.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  James, they -- literally, every Democrat sitting on a committee  is going to figure out some way to investigate President Trump.</p><p> FREEMAN:  That's right.  And I think for her, the play is going to be  looking at his banking relationships, looking at banks that Russia and  China use and trying to tie that somehow to the furious action on the  President's part.</p><p> But Ron, I do wonder, you mentioned none of this legislation that's going  to come out of her committee is going to become law, you mentioned the  investigative piece.  She also has the ability to try to embarrass  administration officials in hearings.</p><p> Do you think she can move the needle and change regulation based on that  pressure on bringing a spotlight to issues she doesn't -- or differences  she has with administration regulations?</p><p> MEYER:  Well, you know, I doubt that she's able to get the President and  the Republican Senate to agree to things by doing anything overly dramatic.   I do think that there's actually some room on financial services to work  across the aisle.  And surprisingly, she has some of the history of doing  that.  And so, if that's where her focus is, I think there could be some  productivity there.</p><p> But it looks like -- I mean, listen, her whole campaign season, we're  talking about going in harassing members of Congress who are Republicans,  whether that a restaurant or a public place.  I mean, I don't really think  she should be the one who should be reaching across aisle, trying to be  productive.</p><p> I think what she's going to be trying to do is try to stay in the  headlines, to try to stay relevant.  And frankly, I think it's something  that President Trump is welcoming.  I think he wants Speaker Pelosi and he  wants Chairman Waters.</p><p> I think he wants these people to be his opponents and to help rev up his  base for 2020.  Do I think it's good for our political system, do I think  it's good for our markets?  Absolutely not, but it's good for President  Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p> So, I don't think he's particularly sad about it because it is going to gin  up the base because they're going to have perfect antagonist to go after.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you got into the President did, Lee, a little interesting  back and forth with Adam Schiff, over the weekend, which we will not go  into because there's a -- anyway -- no, we can't.</p><p> CARTER:  to start with that fire, but one of my questions right now, I  mean, look at, what do you think that we're sacrificing by having the focus  shift be more on international, rather than the things that we have been?</p><p> And on top of that, I'm really curious, you said that you think that they  can compromise or work together and what kinds of things do you think that  they can come together on and what would that do for us?</p><p> MEYER:  Well, Maxine Waters actually worked with Republicans, this last  year, on a bipartisan bill that actually lessens regulations on some  community banks, and I think there's more work to be done there.</p><p> And there are things that Republicans and Democrats can agree on when it  comes to fixing regulations and financial services and putting in good, you  know, consumer protections.  But I think, like I said, I'm not sure that's  really going to be her focus with the comments that we've seen come out and  the structure that she's putting in place at the subcommittees.</p><p> And so, I do think that a large part of her media attention focus will be  on these international banks, tying them to Russia and China and President  Trump.  And what we're going to have unfortunately, I think, is another two  years of really chaotic politics.</p><p> I think -- I'm not sure that's why Democrats won the House, to be honest  with you.  I think Democrats won the House to be a check on the crazy  politics, right?  And instead, they're answering crazy politics with crazy  politics, right?  And so, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's  going to win them the White House in 2020, and I don't think that it's  going to increase the majorities in either House.</p><p> LI:  And it could be bad for business as well, Ron, because -- </p><p> MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p> LI:  Yes, think of, you know, Wells Fargo and John Stumpf, I mean, I  imagine that a lot more bank CEOs in the future will be hauled, in front of  Congress, and probably embarrassed, and asked multiple, multiple questions  about some of their questionable business practices, so what does that say  for -- what does a message being signalled to bank executives?</p><p> MEYER:  I mean, she called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.</p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> MEYER:  And so, what does that tell you?  I mean, I think a lot of us here  have Wells Fargo accounts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little  uncomfortable?  It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  My mortgage is  through Wells Fargo.  I'm a little uncomfortable.</p><p> You know, so I think that many of us who have retirement accounts that do  have savings accounts for our kids' college accounts, aren't particularly  excited about Chairman Waters regulating financial services.</p><p> Even though she doesn't have any legislative authority on her own, the fact  that she can change markets just by calling people in front of Congress and  her, ranging them, the fact that she can start these investigations and  subpoena people, on her own, is rather troubling.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They also are always looking two years ahead, Ron, and does that  really helped them get re-elected, maybe, maybe not.  If you're from a deep  blue district perhaps, if you're Maxine Waters, perhaps, but in those  purple districts, you got to call that into question.</p><p> MEYER:  Yes.  I think you're looking for mature leadership, I think you're  looking for calm leadership, and I think that's why Democrats won House,  and I'm not sure that's what they're going to get with Chairman Waters and  Speaker Pelosi, and I think that long-term, it'll be good for Republicans  to have these two in leadership.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can point you to dozens of preschools across this country that  show more maturity than the people who work in Washington.  Ron -- </p><p> MEYER:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, great to see you, Ron Meyer.  Coming up, a  horror crash in Macau, a teenager, Formula Three driver, survives this  devastating crash during the Macau Grand Prix, a full sports round up is  coming up.  And Hollywood magic, coming to YouTube, video-sharing sites new  venture into streaming, free, future link flicks.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Saudi Arabia's King Salman, delivering a speech on foreign  policy this morning.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, Dagen.  King Salman bin Abdulaziz, is giving his first public  address since the killing of Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi,  after embarking on a nationwide tour with his son, the Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman.  U.S. lawmakers are renewing calls to condemn the  Saudi Kingdom after the CIA concluded the king's, the Saudi prince, ordered  Khashoggi's killing.  On Fox News Sunday, yesterday, President Trump  explained why he won't listen to the tape recording of Khashoggi's murder.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  It's a suffering tape.  It is a terrible tape.  I've been fully  briefed on it.  There's no reason for me to hear it.  Like I said to the  people, should I they said you really shouldn't, there's no reason.  I know  exactly, I know everything that went on where that happened -- </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, the crowned prince has continuously denied his involvement  in Khashoggi's murder.  </p><p> Well, General Electric reportedly facing a dilemma in Iraq, as the company  seeks power sales.  The Wall Street Journal says, the G.E. has learned from  a consultant's report about corruption allegations against some of their  key business partners in Iraq.  The report advises G.E. to distance himself  from at least one of its contracts there.  G.E. is competing with Germany's  Siemens for multi-billion-dollar new power contracts throughout that  country.  Shares of G.E. are lower in the pre-market, a quarter of a  percent right now.  </p><p> Well YouTube is now streaming full length movies for free.  But, of course,  there's a catch because nothing is free, right?  To enjoy them, you've got  to endure advertisements that support the movie.  But if you are willing to  pay to be a YouTube premium subscriber the ads go away.  Movies so far  include \"Rocky,\" \"Zookeeper,\" and \"Legally Blonde\" among other.  Shares of  Google parent company, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, up about one percent  so far this year, Dagen.  And there you go, another way to stream content.   Like number 50.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I hooked my dad with streaming his ACC games or his  University of Virginia games.</p><p> CASONE:  Nice, that's important.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a -- that was a long row, so to speak.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, the teaching moments with our parents can be interesting  sometimes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, dreams of Coach Condi; why  Condoleezza Rice says that she will not be coaching Cleveland Browns.  More  sports, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A lot of drama in NFL yesterday.  Jared Max is here with all of  your sports highlights.  Hey, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  There were  three walk off wins on last second field goals by the Broncos, the Cowboys  and the Raiders.  Last minute comeback went for the Steelers -- how about  the Vikings last night?  First place, Bears were up 14-0.  They were  leading 14-6 when Chicago's Eddy Jackson intercepted Kirk Cousins, brought  it in for a touchdown.  Chicago led 20-6, now, the bear were leading 25-20.   Two minutes to go, Minnesota after a touchdown tries an onside kick, but  the Bears recovering.  Chicago wins, now 7-3 way to off the NFC north.  </p><p> 33 years to the day since legendary Washington Redskins Quarterback Joe  Theismann suffered a career-ending injury -- he was at the Skins' game  Sunday, where the team's current quarterback, Alex Smith suffered identical  injuries that Theismann did.  Just as it happened to Joe, Alex Smith taken  down near the 40-yard line fractured his right fibula and tibia; he's down  for season.  From the game, Theismann tweeted: \"Alex's leg is exactly like  mine.  I feel so bad for him.\"  While Theismann by sacked by all-time great  Lawrence Taylor, Smith in part by modern-day legend, J.J. Watt, who said:  \"Thoughts are with Alex. Absolutely gutted about it.  Never want to see  that for anyone ever.  Wishing you all the best brother.\"  Like the  Theismann game, final score yesterday, 23-21.  Same thing but this time,  the Redskins lost.  </p><p> Hey, did you catch that ESPN report yesterday that said the Cleveland  Browns were going to interview former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  for their head coaching job.  It's not actually happening.  The Browns  said, she's not on the radar and the Madame Secretary confirmed it.   Though, she said she would like to get to call a couple of plates for  Browns, and open doors for women in coaching. </p><p> Watch this Formula 3 crash, at 171 miles per hour.  17-year-old German,  Sophia Floersch, fractured her spine, fractured a facial bone, suffered  concussion and other lacerations; 170 miles per hour at the Macau Grand  Prix in China.  She says, I'm fine but will go into surgery tomorrow.   NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series championship, Homestead, Miami, 12 laps to  go -- oh, well, this is actually before the race.  The parachuter got  caught in the catch fence.  Late in the race, 12 laps to go.  Joey Logano,  who made it to the final, two of the previous three years, finally wins it.   He passes Martin Truex Jr., and Logano gets the big win for Roger Penske  Racing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Roger Penske is an icon, obviously, that was a Ford win.  The --  that's a Ford car.  By the way, I watched it.  Not the biggest Logano fan;  it was Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and then Lagano for the  win.  Martin Truex Jr. racing for furniture row, this ends furniture row  racing.  (INAUDIBLE) and Jimmy Johnson will no longer be the crew chief and  driver team, and (INAUDIBLE) has gone off Jimmy Johnson's car -- and A.J.  (INAUDIBLE) leaves the series, in case you were interested in any of that.  </p><p> MAX:  Well, I know that Lee is going to repeat that all back to you in  alphabetical order.  </p><p> CARTER:  I am, but I have to watch it a few times.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the race, Jared.</p><p> MAX:  Dagen, I was watching football all day, I switched over just before  Logano took the lead at 12 laps to go and this is great.  Saw everything I  needed to see.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What did you watch sports wise yesterday?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I was watching a lot of kids sports this weekend.  And --  sadly our fifth graders lost in the Super Bowl, but they will be back next  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But that was horrific injury for the Redskins.  </p><p> MAX:  Medical -- things have changed so much.  Alex Smith, let's hope he  gets to come back from this.  That was a career-ender for Joe Theismann.  </p><p> CARTER:  30 years ago.</p><p> MAX:  33 years ago to the day, that it was the same score that had happened  near the 40-yard line, the same thing that a legendary defensive player  caused the injury in part on the sack.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Who looks good, team wise, in the NFL right now?  </p><p> MAX:  Tonight game; 2-9-1 (INAUDIBLE) -- that could be a possible super  bowl preview, the Saints, though.  Yesterday they destroyed --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Crushed!</p><p> MAX:  They crushed the Eagles.  That they've scored 40 points or more in  six game this is season, that ties an NFL record.  They look like the team  to beat at this moment.  </p><p> CARTER:  Why can't Condi be the head coach of the Browns?  I think that  would be a great choice.  </p><p> MAX:  Well, she was saying on Facebook, that's not actually what, you know,  she wanted.  </p><p> CARTER:  I want to know where that rumor started.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, she could run the NFL:  That's long been -- shoot.  Condi  Rice could run NASCAR.  I nominate Condi Rice to run NASCAR.  There you go.  </p><p> MAX:  You heard it from her first.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're trying to -- they're trying to sell it.  Again, icon, I  don't know -- if she likes motor sports but it's an idea.  And flying the  flight for female leadership, and I encourage everyone I listen to the Rae  Carruth podcast done by Charlotte observer and Scott Fowley, it is one of  the most moving things you'll ever listen to for Sandra Adams, and  (INAUDIBLE) Adams.  I'll just believe it at that but Rae Carruth is out of  prison now.  Listen to this.  It's incredible reporting and if you are --  if you followed that story at all -- </p><p> MAX:  It's fascinating.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's fascinating.  It's like a seven-part series.  So -- </p><p> MAX:  I didn't want to come see him in prison and then now they're -- and  he has cerebral palsy and so he's being race by his grandmother.  It's a  story of triumph and forgiveness and love.  I'm just -- I'm not going to  give it all away.</p><p> CARTER:  And I can't believe it's been how many years now, over 20 years? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  99 is when she Surekha was murdered.  Thank you so much, Jared.   Sports Reports Fox New Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 155.  Still ahead,  Christmas is coming to the White House.  The tree will arrive in Washington  later today.

The tech industry hasn't done a good job of respecting and protecting that data, he said. \"I'm not a pro-regulation kind of person, I believe in the free market deeply,\" Cook said. But, he added, \"when the free market doesn't produce a result that's great for society, you have to ask yourself: what do we need to do? And I think some level of government regulation is important to come out of that.\"</p><p><br/> Despite advocating for new regulations, Cook, who has repeatedly advocated new privacy rules this year, expressed doubt whether Congress is as up to speed on technology as it would need to be to craft beneficial legislation in the area. The technology \"literacy\" of legislators and their staffs is \"a challenge,\" he said.<br/> \"There is a need to work with Congress and the staff to make sure that we do our jobs of helping them kind of come up to speed on ... on what's possible,\" he said.<br/> Consumer advocates, policy makers, and tech industry figures have been increasingly discussing the need for new privacy regulations, particularly in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal this spring. In that incident, some 87 million customer records were leaked to a data analysis firm linked to President Donald Trump. More recently, Facebook acknowledged that at least 50 million accounts were compromised thanks to a security hole. Cook doesn't think Apple will change its privacy stance<br/>Apple and Cook have repeatedly tried to distinguish the company from its Big Tech peers such as Facebook and Google. Unlike those companies, Apple's business isn't built around advertising revenue or collecting scads of data on its users to target them with ads. Apple actually tries to limit the amount of information it collects on users, Cook said.<br/> \"The way we go into product design, we challenge ourselves to collect as little as possible,\" he said. He continued: \"You are not our product.\" Some in the industry have asserted that Apple's restraint in data collection will ultimately hurt the company's ability to compete with its rivals, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Those technologies tend to improve as they get access to more data. An intelligent assistant, for example, could potentially offer more useful suggestions about what restaurant a user might like if it had more information about what restaurants they've liked in the past.<br/> But Cook disputed the notion that Apple itself needs to collect more data on users to improve it services, suggesting instead that users' devices could collect it instead - without sharing it with the company.<br/> \"The narrative that some companies will try to get you to believe is 'I've got to take all of your data to make my service better.' Well, don't believe that,\" he said. \"Whoever's telling you that - it's a bunch of bonk. We try to keep as much of your information on that device as possible because we want that device to know, because you count on the device to be smart for you.\"<br/> Some consumer advocates have raised the concern that while Apple may respect user privacy now, things could change under Cook's successors. Users' iPhones collect plenty of data and the company at some point in the future could choose to start collecting it for itself.<br/> But Cook disputed that notion too, saying it would go against Apple's culture.<br/> \"I think the next person [who runs Apple], I don't want to commit them, but I can't imagine it. It's not in my imagination that somebody would just say 'oh, time to change,'\" he said. I don't see it.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10682734</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDG-SH21-JBYT-H256-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 3, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

But in a new interview, he acknowledged that getting Congress up to speed on the issue is \"a challenge.\" Cook touted Apple's restraint in terms of collecting information on its users and said he couldn't \"imagine\" one of his successors steering the company in a different direction when it comes to user privacy. Apple CEO Tim Cook is reiterating his call for new government regulations to protect consumer privacy from tech companies. </p><p>The amount of information about individual users stored online and on their phones is enormous, Cook said in an interview with Vice News Tonight on Tuesday. The tech industry hasn't done a good job of respecting and protecting that data, he said. \"I'm not a pro-regulation kind of person, I believe in the free market deeply,\" Cook said. But, he added, \"when the free market doesn't produce a result that's great for society, you have to ask yourself: what do we need to do? And I think some level of government regulation is important to come out of that.\" Despite advocating for new regulations, Cook, who has repeatedly advocated new privacy rules this year[1], expressed doubt whether Congress is as up to speed on technology as it would need to be to craft beneficial legislation in the area. The technology \"literacy\" of legislators and their staffs is \"a challenge,\" he said. \"There is a need to work with Congress and the staff to make sure that we do our jobs of helping them kind of come up to speed on ... on what's possible,\" he said. Consumer advocates, policy makers, and tech industry figures have been increasingly discussing the need for new privacy regulations, particularly in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal[2] this spring. In that incident, some 87 million customer records were leaked to a data analysis firm linked to President Donald Trump. More recently, Facebook acknowledged that at least 50 million accounts were compromised[3] thanks to a security hole.Cook doesn't think Apple will change its privacy stanceApple and Cook have repeatedly tried to distinguish the company from its Big Tech peers such as Facebook and Google. Unlike those companies, Apple's business isn't built around advertising revenue or collecting scads of data on its users to target them with ads. Apple actually tries to limit the amount of information it collects on users, Cook said. \"The way we go into product design, we challenge ourselves to collect as little as possible,\" he said. He continued: \"You are not our product.\" Some in the industry have asserted that Apple's restraint in data collection will ultimately hurt the company's ability to compete with its rivals, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Those technologies tend to improve as they get access to more data. An intelligent assistant, for example, could potentially offer more useful suggestions about what restaurant a user might like if it had more information about what restaurants they've liked in the past. But Cook disputed the notion that Apple itself needs to collect more data on users to improve it services, suggesting instead that users' devices could collect it instead \u2014 without sharing it with the company. \"The narrative that some companies will try to get you to believe is 'I've got to take all of your data to make my service better.' Well, don't believe that,\" he said. \"Whoever's telling you that - it's a bunch of bonk. We try to keep as much of your information on that device as possible because we want that device to know, because you count on the device to be smart for you.\" Some consumer advocates have raised the concern that while Apple may respect user privacy now, things could change under Cook's successors. Users' iPhones collect plenty of data and the company at some point in the future could choose to start collecting it for itself. But Cook disputed that notion too, saying it would go against Apple's culture. \"I think the next person [who runs Apple], I don't want to commit them, but I can't imagine it. It's not in my imagination that somebody would just say 'oh, time to change,'\" he said. I don't see it.\"NOW WATCH: The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is a $1,000 phone that's actually worth it[4]See Also: The making of an AI rock star: Kai-Fu Lee has much to say about machine learning, Google
