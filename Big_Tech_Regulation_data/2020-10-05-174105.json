When  Sens. <person><nameText>Ted Cruz (R-Tex.</nameText></person>) and <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren  (D-Mass.</nameText></person>) call for the same thing, it is possible that even in Washington - The City Where Nothing Happens - Congress will decide that  technology companies  must be regulated. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such an outcome would be a bad mistake - bad for the companies, of course, but also bad for us, their users, and bad for the country. </p><p>I do not pretend to be unbiased in writing this. While I am about as tech-savvy as your average 72-year-old , I met Mark Zuckerberg when he was 20, and spent six years on <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>board. As publisher and later   chairman of The Post, I watched the rise of Google, <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Amazon and Apple, sometimes with hope, sometimes with awe and sometimes with horror for what it meant to The Post's business. </p><p>To start with the basics: The big technology companies ought to obey the laws that apply to all businesses. They should pay their taxes and comply with antitrust laws. If they make mistakes, they should admit them quickly and act transparently to fix them. <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>in particular, faces a huge challenge in convincing its users that they can trust it to safeguard their data.</p><p>So why not regulate these companies more? First: Google and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>are platforms where a great deal of today's political speech and reporting of news takes place, and regulation is an inherently political act. If you want a Technology Company Regulation Commission, its chairman and its members will be appointed by presidents and will reflect their policies. </p><p>Do presidents really play a role in regulation or enforcement? Well, you can listen to the Watergate tapes and hear President  <person><nameText>Richard Nixon  </nameText></person>direct his advisers John Dean and H.R. Haldeman to use the Federal Communications Commission's regulatory process to take away TV stations owned by The Washington Post Co.  Challenges to stations' licenses by Nixon supporters did ensue and, had Nixon not resigned, they would have been heard by an FCC led by the former chairman of the Republican National Committee . It is difficult to convince me that regulation is apolitical.</p><p>If you want Google, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other tech companies regulated, you are asking for a system in which President Trump - or (perhaps in the future) President <person><nameText>Elizabeth  Warren </nameText></person>- plays a role in deciding what goes on your <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>page or what flows from your Google search. Is that really what you want?</p><p>And how do you argue that government should be able to regulate speech on YouTube but not your own speech, or that of The Post? </p><p>Second: I worked in regulated industries for years, and regulation can be fairly described as odd. Regulators often do not or cannot talk face-to-face with those being regulated to understand the consequences of what they are doing. The conversation is conducted through lawyers on both sides. Is there a set of regulators in Washington who would understand how Google or <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is put together?</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google argue they have one goal in their principal businesses: innovating to satisfy their customers. Regulation introduces a different goal: not offending the regulators. Technology companies must move fast; regulation slows things down, sometimes drastically. Almost inevitably, this hurts a company's performance. Money, time and, above all, management attention that might be focused on innovation and satisfying customers are focused elsewhere. </p><p>From the day it began accepting advertising, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has walked a line, sometimes carefully, sometimes not. It promised advertisers the ability to target ads at users who were interested in their products; it promised users that their data would be private. Careful compromises should have been able to maintain trust with both sets of users.</p><p>The most important control over <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>- greater than anything governments could come up with - is the ability of its users to quit. Zuckerberg has a huge incentive to keep our data private and to prove that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has done so (the standards that permitted Cambridge Analytica to access user data were changed three years ago). <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>needs to go to any possible length to convince its irritated users that it can be trusted. </p><p>Taken together, the big tech companies constitute a rare area where America leads the world. If you don't believe they are important to the country, look at how they are treated elsewhere. In Europe, the home of many unsuccessful competitors, they are fined and regulated not because they are lawbreakers, but because they are American. And in China, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google - as well as Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia - are banned because they encourage free speech and free thought.</p><p>Instead, the Chinese have created massive competitors such as Tencent  and Baidu, sheltered from Western competition in their enormous home market. If Google and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>slow down - remember that most of the world's users are outside the United States - these competitors will easily pass them by. </p><p>Will it be an aid to your privacy to search on Baidu or share on Tencent? I don't think so.</p><p>I hope the technology companies are wise enough to take the measures needed to convince users that they care about their privacy. And I hope our country is wise enough not to regulate them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-61c83acc314a11e88abc22a366b72f2d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYP-64T1-JB4M-V0Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><timeReceived>12:10 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

And they're doing a ridiculously dumb job of it. We've talked a lot about the EU, with the Copyright Directive[1] and now the Terrorist Content Regulation[2]. And then there's Australia with its anti-encryption[3] law and its \"abhorrent content\" law[4]. India has already passed a few bad laws[5] regarding the internet[6] and is discussing a few more. Then there's the UK[7], Germany[8], South Korea[9], Singapore[10], Thailand[11], Cameroon[12], etc. etc. etc. You get the idea. </p><p>Oh, and certainly, the US is considering some really bad ideas[13] as well. When you look at what \"problem\" all of these laws are trying to solve, it can basically be boiled down to \"people do bad things on the internet, and we need to regulate the internet because of it.\" This is problematic to me for a variety of reasons, in part because it seems to be regulating the wrong party. We should, ideally, be going after the people doing the bad things, rather than the tools and services they are using to do the bad things (or to merely promote the bad things they're doing). However, there is an argument -- not one that I wholly buy into -- that one reasonable way to regulate is to focus less on which party is actually doing the bad thing, and more on which party is best positioned to minimize the harm of the bad thing. And it's that theory of regulation (applied stupidly) that is behind much of the regulatory theory on the internet these days. Well, there's also a second theory behind many of the regulatory approaches, and it's \"Google and Facebook are big and bad, so anything that punishes them is good regulation\". This makes even less sense to me than the other approach, but it is certainly driving a lot of the thinking, at least in the EU (and possibly the US). Combine those two driving theories for regulating the internet and you've got a pretty big mess. They seem to be taking a sledge hammer to huge parts of the internet, rather than looking for narrow, targeted approaches. And, on top of that, in focusing so much on Google and Facebook, so many of these laws are written solely with those two platforms in mind, and with no thought to how it impacts every other internet company, many of which operate on a very different basis. Earlier this year, I wrote up my thoughts on what sort of regulatory approach would really \"break up\" big tech[14] while preserving an open internet, but it's an approach that would require a very big shift in mindsets (one I'm still hoping will occur). However, Ben Thompson has taken a much more practical approach to thinking through regulating the internet. He, like me, is skeptical of most of these attempts to regulate the internet, but recognizing that it's absolutely going to happen no matter how skeptical we are, he is proposing a framework for thinking about regulating the internet[15], in a way that would (hopefully) minimize the worst outcomes from the approaches being used today. You should read the whole thing to understand the thinking, the background, and the approach, but the key aspects to Thompson's framework are to recognize that there are different kinds of internet companies -- and that's true not just up and down the stack, but across the different kinds of services. So his hope is that if the regulatory approaches were more narrowly targeted to a manner in which they fit better we'd have a lot less collateral damage in trying to shove a square regulatory approach through a round internet service. Another key to his approach is a more modern update to the common \"free as in speech v. free as in beer\" concept that everyone in the open source world is familiar with. Ben talks about a third option that has been discussed for decades[16], which is \"free as in puppy\" -- meaning something that you get for free, but which then has an ongoing cost in terms of maintaining the free thing you got.Most in the West agree, at least in theory, with the idea that the Internet should preserve 'free as in speech'; China in particular represents a cautionary tale as to how technology can be leveraged in the opposite direction. The question that should be asked, though, is if preserving 'free as in speech' should also mean preserving 'free as in beer.' Specifically, Facebook and YouTube offer 'free as in speech' in conjunction with 'free as in beer': content can be created and proliferated without any responsibility, including cost. Might it be better if content that society deemed problematic were still 'free as in speech', but also 'free as in puppy' \u2014 that is, with costs to the supplier that aligned with the costs to society?With that premise, he suggests a way to better target any potential platform regulation:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/orOPDQoIn\">https://imgur.com/orOPDQoIn</url> theory, this lets various countries who believe there are certain problems on the internet more narrowly target their regulations without harming other parts of the internet:This distinct categorization is critical to developing regulation that actually addresses problems without adverse side effects. Australia, for example, has no need to be concerned about shared hosting sites, but rather Facebook and YouTube; similarly, Europe wants to rein in tech giants without \u2014 and I will give the E.U. the benefit of the doubt here \u2014 burdening small online businesses with massive amounts of red tape. And, from a theoretical perspective, the appropriate place for regulation is where there is market failure; constraining the application to that failure is what is so difficult.Please don't comment on this without first reading Ben's entire piece, as it gets into a lot more detail. He very readily admits that this doesn't answer all the questions (and, indeed, likely creates a bunch of new ones). I will admit that I'm not convinced by this model, but I do appreciate that it's given me a lot to think about. At the very least, in targeting just the ad-supported platforms for regulation solves two problems: (1) the mis-aligned incentives of ad-supported platforms to consider the wider societal impact of the platform, and (2) the sledge-hammer approach to regulating all internet platforms, no matter what type and where in the internet stack they reside, by more narrowly focusing it just at the application level and just at a particular type of service. And, frankly, this kind of approach could potentially move us towards that world of \"protocols, not platforms\" that I envision (a more regulated ad-supported platform world might push companies to explore non-advertising based business models). I still have lots of concerns, however, for all of the complaints about what Google and Facebook have done with an ad supported model, we should be willing to admit that an ad supported model has created some incredibly powerful services that have really done amazing things for many, many people. Everyone focuses on the negatives -- which exist -- but we shouldn't ignore how much of the good stuff we've gotten because of an internet built on the back of advertising. Can it be improved? Absolutely. But targeting internet advertising as \"the problem\" still feels too broad to me (and, in fact, I think Ben would likely agree on that point). If there must be a regulatory approach, it should not be targeted just by the nature of the platform, but around the specific and articulated harm that it is trying to solve. At least that way, we can weigh the harms such a law might mitigate, against the good aspects it might hinder, and then be better able to judge whether or not the regulatory approach makes sense. I'm still skeptical that most plans to regulate the internet will do a very good job of narrowly targeting actual harms (and to do so without throwing away lots of good stuff), but since we're going to be having lots of discussions around these regulations in the coming weeks, months, and years, we might as well start having the discussion of how we should view and analyze these proposed laws. And, on that front, Ben's contribution is a useful way of thinking about these things.Permalink[17] | Comments[18] | Email This Story[19] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url

The Irish DPC office is currently lukewarm on the idea, not least because they haven't yet given Facebook the go-ahead for tighter advertising links with WhatsApp. This isn't deterring the Facebook chief executive, who sees it purely as a matter of making the apps 'better'.</p><p>Indeed, on issues of governance and regulatory oversight, Mr Zuckerberg appears not to see any real threat coming down the line.</p><p>This is a little surprising, given that his company owns the four biggest online communication platforms (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp) outside email.</p><p>One of his talking points is that regulators in Europe and the US need to be mindful about over-regulating western companies like his, because to restrict them much more might be to hand greater influence to companies based in less scrupulous parts of the world, like China.</p><p>TikTok, which is probably the fastest-growing new social media platform among younger people, is a case in point.</p><p>To push the point home even further, Mr Zuckerberg said that GDPR should be deployed as a way to level the playing field with Chinese-based platforms like TikTok.</p><p>GDPR, he said, should also start to look at where data is stored - shorthand for taking a closer regulatory rein on tech rivals that have data servers in China, such as Apple.</p><p>\"GDPR is as important for what it doesn't do, which is require companies to localise data and store systems data in a given country,\" he said, referring to Apple's compromise with Chinese authorities, where it stores data in servers located in that country. Facebook and Google are not allowed to operate in China.</p><p>\"We can take this for granted in a country like Ireland or in the US where there's a strong rule of law and respect for human rights. But in a lot of the places around the world, those aren't a given.</p><p>\"What we see is that there are some competing visions for how the internet goes and what the future of that will be.\"</p><p>There were issues he didn't spend much time talking about, such as child protection.</p><p>Then again, few under-13s use Facebook, a point often lost on older TDs who lump all online platforms together.</p><p>There are some competing  ;  ;  visions for how the internet goes ;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-148081704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTN-YFW1-JCBW-N2TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 6, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They are not a \"new type of corporation\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sure, they have pretty interfaces on your screen and bean bags in their offices. But you should never forget what they are: profit driven, hungry conglomerates that obliterate their competition, refuse to pay their fair share of tax, rapaciously collect private data and, of course, destroy journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A decade ago, Rolling Stone described the investment bank Goldman Sachs as a \"great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money\". What we've learned recently about the tech giants make Goldman Sachs look like a soft touch by comparison.</p><p>For the past decade, these behemoths have grown with impunity. Regulators have struggled to understand them and politicians have been afraid to challenge them, frightened of being deemed Luddites in the digital age. They are rarely, if ever, called into account.</p><p>All of which made the report this week from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission so amazing. The message to Google and Facebook from Australia's competition commission was pretty clear: \"You are behaving like reckless jerks.\" Of course, that's not the language of Rod Sims (pictured), the mild mannered but highly effective head of the ACCC, used. But that was his point. What he actually said was: \"Digital platforms don't recognise original content and source in ranking.\" The upshot of the report was this: Google and Facebook take the work of others and amalgamate it.</p><p>Think journalism, art and video.</p><p>They don't actually create it. They just bring it together. Then they suck up all the advertising dollars that would otherwise go to those creating the content. Why? Because businesses have no choice but to pay the money to Google and Facebook rather than the actual source.</p><p>The ACCC identified this as a reality of business that can't be avoided. The outcome is that the tech giants are getting rich while anyone who produces content goes broke. The model is unfair.</p><p>It is also not sustainable.</p><p>So far the policy has been to allow these companies to \"self regulate\", which is a nice way of saying let them do anything they want, without any oversight. Sims has made it clear that this needs to come to an end.</p><p>So how do you fix it? How do you make it fair?</p><p>Well, the ACCC has made 11 recommendations.</p><p>But I had an idea. Well, not just me - Nick Xenophon, the Greens' Scott Ludlam and I did.</p><p>Almost two years ago, we launched an inquiry into the future of journalism. It had lofty goals. Unfortunately the three of us were far better at starting inquiries than surviving in Parliament.</p><p>Whatever our fates, our idea was this: put a levy on companies like Google and Facebook, and use that money to make an investment in journalism and content creation tax free. That was it. Simple.</p><p>Australia already has tax-free exemptions for research and development; why not have the same for journalism and content creation. Make the big tech companies pay for it. It's not like they are struggling, after all.</p><p>The next (likely Labor) government is going to have to take the tech giants on. It will get ugly. They will fight any constraint.</p><p>Aside from what they are doing to journalism and content; the future of the Australian tax system also sits in the balance. Their ability to bank their profits offshore has made them some of the world's most effective tax dodgers.</p><p>They will also need to tackle how these companies collect, and then sell, our private data.</p><p>Some might argue, that the choice is in the hand of the consumer. If you don't like how the tech giants behave; just don't use their products. Delete Facebook and don't use Google.</p><p>But that's a false choice.</p><p>As the ACCC has noted, businesses can't avoid them. And frankly, I love their products, and for good reason, too. My Facebook page has a lifetime of friends, from school to university to work that I keep up to date with. I'm obsessed with Twitter to get immediate news. I spend my days Googling childhood shows and obscure articles.</p><p>I shouldn't have to choose. I shouldn't have to be forced to consider getting rid of them. What we need is regulation that holds these companies in check, allows them to remain profitable, and lets us enjoy their benefits without destroying journalism and content creation.</p><p>The ACCC report is definitely worth reading. If you get a chance you should Google it. Better still, I'll post it on my Facebook page.Sam Dastyari is a former senator for NSW</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-503b2d42fdc711e883dc5788a94cc6c3999e26a4702d54d3242b51d94d026bb1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYC-V241-JD3N-547W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>CourierMail Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 13, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The big tech companies like Microsoft and Google used their airtime to call for more regulation, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>It's a broad term that applies to a set of different technologies. Over the past couple of years, discussion at Davos has focused on what impact AI and increasing automation might have on jobs, society, and privacy.</p><p>Everyone agrees that the development of AI needs to be done responsibly and carefully. They also agree that it needs to be regulated.</p><p>Believe it or not, the loudest calls for regulation are coming from the tech giants themselves. IBM's chief executive Ginni Rometty told CNBC at Davos that she backs AI regulation on \"how the technology is used\", but not necessarily the technology itself.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai called for \"sensible regulation\". Satya Nadella, the boss of Microsoft, called for global rules around AI. He also backed regulation around the \"time of use\" of AI, like facial recognition.</p><p>So why is big tech pushing so hard for more regulation? First, these firms want to seem like benevolent forces using technology for good. And they want to make it seem like they are ready to work with governments around the world.</p><p>But I would argue that they actually see regulation as a chance to increase their dominance.</p><p>There have been calls for the breaking up of big technology firms in the US. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator and presidential candidate, is perhaps the best-known proponent, arguing that these companies have become too dominant. In the EU, the argument for the regulation of big tech firms is that they have become too powerful and have stifled competition.</p><p>However, we have seen before that regulation can have unintended consequences. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) brought in stringent rules around the handling of people's personal information and data. It was designed to make sure that there was no misuse for data. But the cost of complying with it was so high that it actually helped Google and Facebook consolidate their dominance of the European advertising market.</p><p>A similar trend could happen if more and more regulation is brought in, particularly around AI. Big tech can afford the lawyers and compliance costs, while startups could be left behind.</p><p>With AI being seen as such a critical technology, big tech's power could be stronger than ever. That's why the bosses of these firms want more rules.</p><p>\u00a3 Arjun Kharpal is senior technology correspondent at CNBC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-156939712</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y31-8KG1-DYTY-C0PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"436\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City A.M.

She once operated an underground restaurant out of her apartment.</nitf:byttl></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2012, I teamed up with a bread baker, urban farmers and home-based food makers to advocate for the California Homemade Food Act, a law that allows for the sale of homemade foods that are low-risk and do not require refrigeration, such as breads and jams. Thousands of new enterprises were formed or became legal under the act, many of them owned by women, immigrants and small-crop farmers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Homemade Food Act was a good start, but it was limited. Many more homemade products, including more-perishable foods, would be safe to sell from our home kitchens with appropriate oversight.</p><p>Now a proposed expansion of the law, Assembly Bill 626, is making its way through the California Legislature, and you'd think I'd be on board. But this bill isn't the product of bakers, home cooks and farmers; it's backed by gig economy tech companies. It would allow sales of homemade meals through web apps that take a cut of cooks' earnings.</p><p>AB 626 passed in the Assembly in January; it's due for a Senate committee vote Wednesday. It shouldn't get any further.</p><p>If AB 626 becomes law, the homemade food market would likely become dominated by big companies like Airbnb and Uber. The trajectory of these businesses is rapid growth fueled by venture capital and aimed at disrupting and then monopolizing a market. They disregard important public safety laws and worker protections by treating the workers as independent contractors. They could easily overwhelm the homemade food economy just as they have ride hailing, delivery services and vacation rentals.</p><p>Food-system jobs are among the lowest paid in our society, but at least most food workers are employees who are entitled to minimum wage, overtime, workers' compensation insurance, and other protections. If homemade food is dominated by gig economy tech companies, home cooks could end up working in situations where their net earnings are less than minimum wage. Companies such as Uber and TaskRabbit take 15% to 30% of the earnings of their workers. Margins are so tight for home cooks, they wouldn't be able to survive.</p><p>Yes, we should have a more permissive homemade food law in California, and there's nothing wrong with allowing web apps to facilitate it. But the Legislature should require that third-party web applications used to order and distribute the food must be owned and controlled by cooks and delivery workers, nonprofit organizations, or local governments -- not by big technology companies.</p><p>This may sound heavy-handed, but long-standing California law already prohibits big food companies from operating farmers markets. Only nonprofits, governmental organizations and farmers themselves are allowed to run the markets; they exist to support growers and consumers, not middlemen.</p><p>We can also learn from Austin, Texas, when it comes to incorporating web apps into a service economy. In 2016, Austin enacted safety regulations for ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft, causing both companies to decamp from the city. What emerged in their place was a remarkable flourishing of local ride hailing apps, including the nonprofit RideAustin and the driver-owned ATX Co-op Taxi. Both offer better pay for drivers along with the convenience of mobile phone apps. Such community-based alternatives could never compete with Silicon Valley tech giants.</p><p>Just as we don't let Amazon, Walmart and Ralphs operate farmers markets in California, we shouldn't let Uber Eats run our homemade food economy. Markets need basic regulations to avoid monopolization and to protect workers and consumers. AB 626 betrays the food movement for the benefit of Big Tech. The Legislature should reject it and instead work with food makers and community organizations on a more just approach to expanding the Homemade Food Act.</p><p>Consumers, farmers and cooks deserve better than the Uberization of homemade food.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LATN-PR3SN04U</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SKV-HXT1-DXXV-351N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Los Angeles Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Los Angeles Times</publicationName><edition>Home Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 20, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion piece</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has released a list of ways you can ensure fast and reliable internet. These range from using an Ethernet cable to turning off your microwave. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. As the coronavirus outbreak forces millions to work from home, ensuring fast and reliable home internet has become vital. Internet traffic during the outbreak has surged so much that big tech companies includingYouTube[2], Netflix, and Amazon[3] have lowered the quality of their video streaming to reduce bandwidth usage. Facebook, meanwhile, is struggling to deal with the sudden spike in usage[4]. Britain's media regulator Ofcom on Tuesday released a list of tips and tricks[5] to help people ensure the fastest internet possible while they work remotely.Here are seven things you can do to make sure your internet is running at top speed:1. For reliable calls, avoid using data as much as possible. Elsa/Getty ImagesWith everyone stuck at home, lots more people are making calls using data during the day. Ofcom recommends using a landline (if you have one) or sticking to WiFi to make reliable calls over services like Skype, FaceTime, or WhatsApp. Some phones and providers also have an option for \"WiFi calling,\" which can be enabled in the phone's settings.2. Move your WiFi router away from other devices. Fortinet via InstagramAccording to Ofcom: \"Cordless phones, baby monitors, halogen lamps, dimmer switches, stereos and computer speakers, TVs and monitors can all affect your WiFi if they're too close to your router.\"3. Don't keep your router on the floor. Casezy Idea/ShutterstockOfcom recommends you keep your router on a shelf or table.See the rest of the story at Business Insider[6] See Also: San Francisco reported its first death of the coronavirus

In it, the Facebook[2] boss called for greater regulation of the internet to protect individuals' online privacy, among other things. Although the goals he sets out are laudable, we shouldn't hold our collective breath that things will change anytime soon. While his position is meant to protect all users, there is a second wave of legislative proposals designed to protect kids online - the KIDS and DETOUR Acts in particular - following similar moves almost 2 decades ago in the form of COPPA and CIPA. All are designed to protect kids online, because current laws, new technologies, and tech industry self- regulation have fallen short.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/online_1556657574.jpgcuncon\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/online_1556657574.jpgcuncon</url>[3] / PixabayHowever, legal solutions are limited in their ability to truly prevent a child from falling victim to an internet scam or being tempted to give up personal information that puts them at risk. With the multitude of apps, websites, and devices becoming available every day, enforcement of such laws are hard to ensure. They are still needed and worthwhile, but we should not wait or assume a new law is enough. Instead, we need to take matters into our own hands to protect our families from intrusive online tracking. Our online activities are a blueprint of our daily lives that should stay private.  Get Our Activist Investing Case Study!

Q1 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[4]A call for regulationZuckerberg set out four areas he claimed Facebook would like to see more government intervention on to protect society: harmful content, election integrity[5], privacy, and data portability. In the area of privacy, he called for a globally harmonized framework in line with the sweeping European law introduced last year known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This would give consumers greater choice over how their personal data is used, and place greater accountability on the firms that use it to keep it safe and secure. When online services stake their survival on advertising dollars, personal information is the product that they must mine, store and trade. Each time we go online, we become part of that ecosystem, leaving traces of our existence behind for big tech companies to dig up and sell to the highest bidders. It is hard to imagine a company like Facebook asking for less control over a system that has made it so rich for so long, but it is now seeing the full impact of its uncontrolled access (and a society very willing to give up so much privacy). They have finally concluded that the cost of bringing a powerful platform to the world is becoming greater than the good it first set out to do. Laws can certainly help. They can force standardization, create strong incentives to play by the rules, and remove the inconsistencies and weaknesses of self-regulation. However, they take time to be passed and even once in place, must be enforced to be effective. There's no guarantee that any new legislation would ultimately limit online tracking or be successful in discouraging bad behavior. Google was fined [6]$57 million under the GDPR[7] for failing to be transparent over how personal data is used to personalize ads, but it took 7 months after the law went into effect for this verdict to be found. This makes it vital for us to act now and take control of our online lives.A digital blueprintWhy should we care? Because the sites and apps we visit online, the terms we search for, and the things we buy, read and download can be pieced together to create a startlingly accurate map of our lives. Everything from the age, medical history, birth dates, location and incomes of family members could be tracked without your knowledge. Typically, social networks like Facebook, search providers like Google and other firms use these to serve up personalized content and advertising. The idea is that they're creating a better experience for the user, while also making money off of more accurate advertising. It means the Google results returned for you might be very different from those of your kids, for example. But, think about all the tens of thousands of clicks, you and your family make in a day. Are you comfortable with these companies having that data? Here's a list [8]of exactly how deep their knowledge of our lives can go. Even if you're fine with these sites having access to your family's internet data, the truth is that these sites also share it with third-party trackers, which in turn can share it with other third-party trackers[9]and so on. At best, it's a bit creepy. At worst, this data could end up in the wrong hands and put your family in danger of identity theft, blackmail, or worse.How tracking worksThe first step to taking back control is understanding how internet tracking works. There are three main ways internet firms track your activity behind the scenes, not to mention all the things shared deliberately. Let's look at the covert tracking first: Cookies: perhaps the best known. They're small pieces of unique data sent from each website and stored in your browser to identify you each time you return. Browser fingerprinting: another method [10]used by websites to identify your machine. They collect information including browser type and version, OS version, screen resolution, supported fonts, plugins, time zone, language and more. Web beacons: tiny invisible objects [11]hidden in web pages/emails which alert the owner when you open it up. But, these tracking methods are just the beginning. Everything you have knowingly posted, liked, downloaded, watched, bought, engaged with, etc. online is also tracked. This type of tracking is spelled out in terms of service agreements and privacy policies, but how often have you clicked 'agree' without reading a word of those clauses? Collectively, all of this tracking can paint a pretty detailed picture of your family's life.How do I stop it?Fortunately, there are things you can do to protect your family's online privacy from all forms of tracking. Let's start with what you engage with intentionally. Check all social media, browser, and search engine settings to see what all is being tracked. I bet you will be shocked when you look in Facebook at all the 'liked' organizations you've engaged with over time - because everything from the first day you turned on a Facebook account is still listed there. Also be cognizant of what information you are volunteering about your family. Checking in at the mall, the path you ran around the neighborhood this morning, vacation plans, kids birthdays and school events, etc. all add up to a holistic picture of day-to-day and long term activities you take part in. These are not just helpful for Facebook to sell for ad revenue - criminals use this publicly shared information for real-world crimes[12], like robbery. Next time you share an update, think about whether it compromises your family's privacy in a way that matters to you. As for the covert, behind-the-scenes tracking, what you need to do will vary from browser to browser. You'll have to check the security and privacy settings in your [13]browser of choice to understand what is being tracked and whether you want to take action. As an example, here's what to do in Chrome: Click on the three dots in the top right-hand corner of the browser. Go Settings, Advanced (at the bottom of the page). Here there are a list of privacy and security settings you can toggle off if you feel uncomfortable with them. It's recommended that Safe Browsing is kept on to protect you from dangerous sites, while enabling Do Not Track will help prevent third- party sites storing your data, although it's not 100% effective. Click on content settings to look at additional privacy Go into Cookies. Most people will Allow sites to save and read cookie data because switching this off means having to log-in to sites each time you visit them. However, you may want additionally to keep local data until you quit your browser to limit what data sites can harvest from you. Also, you may want to block third-party cookies, as these track your browsing history across multiple Finally, consider using incognito browsing on Chrome[14] (known as private mode in Apple's Safari browser). Your browsing history will not be collected and cookies won't be left on your computer. It doesn't stop the sites you are visiting from tracking or knowing what you're doing on their sites, but can provide some semblance of There are answers to strengthening our family's privacy online. A combination of laws, improved design, and our own actions is one of the best options we have to keeping the internet a safer place for all of us.

He is now working with the union to roll out the software.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>Drive, Nextcloud is cloud-based software. It's written in open source code so anyone can change and redistribute it. In the UK, it is hosted and distributed by the Sheffield co-operative Webarchitects.</p><p>Open source software offers a transparent and free way to store data online. The open-source and co-operative movements share the same philosophy, according to Chris Croome, 52, a co-founder of Webarchitects. \"Co-operatives are about sharing, and the free open software movement is about using licences to ensure sharing, rather than reinforcing hoarding or scarcity. If you're concerned about privacy and want a world that isn't run by very large, rich corporations, you may not want them hosting your data.\"</p><p>Next month Casaco, a co-operative operation in Paris with 120 members, will install the open-source social network Startin'blox as an alternative to Facebook, Slack and Whatsapp. \"Some co-working spaces are about real estate but this is not our philosophy,\" said Aur\u00e9lien Denaes, 31, a co-founder of Casaco. \"We wanted to create a place free from hierarchy.\"</p><p>Casaco will use tools on Startin'blox for payments and invoicing and it will act as a social network connecting the users of the co-working space and eventually those of other co-operatives. \"If we can't have control over the tools, we don't have any liberty in our work,\" Mr Denaes said.</p><p>Alexandre Bourlier, 30, decided to help set up Startin'blox amid concerns that the tech industry is becoming increasingly monopolised. \"We trust a company with all data and this gives the company too much power,\" he said. \"Nobody is able to control it. The EU issues a fine every ten years but I don't think it solves anything.\"</p><p>Mr Bourlier, an advocate for decoupling, or separating applications from data so that several players can operate, said: \"Even if <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>products are good, we are still losing from not having tens of them.\"</p><p>Startin'blox will be released to the public in October, funded by (EURO)50,000 from Happy Dev, a sister business started by Mr Bourlier and Sylvain Le Bon, 35, and funded by a bank loan and money from friends and family.</p><p>The platform will operate on a Freemium model like Spotify, converting free users to a tiered, paid model over time. In the UK, Nextcloud is offered free to users and funded through hourly paid work by Mr Croome from Webarchitects.</p><p>Mr Robbins believes that the cost of development is the key barrier to growth. Open-source projects are up against some of the richest companies in the world. \"It is difficult to see how the open-source community can get together enough funds without government backing to rival [them].\"</p><p>Co-operatives are working across national borders. At the Open Co-op conference in London developers discussed linking services to compete with Microsoft Office and <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>Drive. The tipping point, Mr Robbins says, will be when big organisations such as schools and universities back open-source projects.</p><p>The co-op movement is only just beginning to see the potential of open-source software to strengthen its values of democracy, equality and autonomy. \"There's a lot of potential that hasn't yet been realised,\" Mr Croome said. \"If you want to create a different system, you have to put your money where your mouth is.\"</p><p>                     Out of sight on Minds                     For Mark Harding, 24, co-founder of the social network Minds, the move towards open-source software is inevitable. \"Food brands have to say what's in their products, so why shouldn't you know what's in the software that you use?\" he says.</p><p>With one million users, Minds is an open-source network similar to Facebook.

You bet. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, anyone beyond the dwindling band of tech-utopians will be more aware of how easy it is to offer up your data to a tech platform or third parties, without understanding who could access it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But are we concerned or even aware enough about the speed of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, gathering by authoritarian governments, potentially with far greater impact on the global data eco-system and our own lives? Not remotely. Of the emerging interfaces of policy, regulation and digital innovation, this is the one that troubles me most.</p><p>More so than the arrogance of Silicon Valley, because for all the many shortcomings of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, they are being dragged into a public debate about their activities and forced to change some of their conduct - or suffer the competitive consequences.</p><p>For truly unaccountable power in data-use and AI, look to major state players with weak accountability. Foremost is, China, where the speed of innovation and implementation of robotics and advanced machine learning is matched by a tightening of control by the state . Last year I interviewed some Chinese tech figures for The Economist and found their scale and ambition awesome; Didi Chuxing, having seen off Uber, is now working with manufacturers to introduce driverless cars to Chinese cities within the decade.</p><p>WeChat, the micro-messaging service with nearly a billion users, is the means by which many Chinese customers pay for goods and exchange information, creating a vast info-harvest on how its users live. Hangzhou as the country's leading the \"smart city\" can track every resident, their social media activity, purchases and movements. Promethean in its ambition, many of these developments are also prospectively dystopian when it coincides with a system of state surveillance, combined with rejection of the rights of citizens to change their system of government. A pilot scheme in Suining has awarded people points for \"good\" behaviour, and deducted points for \"bad\"behaviour, from traffic offences to politically inconvenient activity. \"Social ranking\" - in which data on everything from your credit score to your traffic fines is logged and coded to produce a score of your usefulness as a civilian - most benefits those who seek to exert control.</p><p>These projects are now so closely intertwined with the interests of those who govern China that they appoint its representatives to the boards of major companies - and new laws enshrine the ability of the state to grab data on wide-ranging grounds.</p><p>For all the grubbier opportunism of western tech companies, they have a more cautious relationship with government. A free press means that abuses are revealed and titanic companies such as Facebook can crash into icebergs. Big-data systems in democracies are most often designed for profit, meaning that users have the ultimate sanction of simply switching off their accounts.</p><p>By contrast, we are only just starting to pay sufficient attention to the Kremlin's growing, threatening obsession with AI. The point of Vladimir Putin's boast about his new nuclear weapons cache was not just the return to Cold War competition in deadly missiles - but that AI might help even up the scales with the US . \"AI,\" Mr Putin says, \"Is key to Russia beating the US in defence.\"</p><p>The power and threat of AI lies in the fact that it is now so close to all our lives and impervious to state borders, as companies increasing integrate search engines, speech-recognition and automated customer-service bots into their products and services.</p><p>The West cannot opt out of the race against AI developers in undemocratic countries, because it is a globalised business, whose products can be transferred at low cost across borders. That makes it virtually impossible to guard against some data ending up in the wrong hands.</p><p>So far, our ability to regulate has lagged: the former information commissioner Christopher Graham reckons we are 10 years behind developments in data-gathering. But that is changing as the public mood becomes more testing. In an open society, more pressure for transparency, a free flow of information and noisy pressure groups create checks and balances that will help us better understand and deal with AI.

He spoke to Adrian Weckler</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Adrian Weckler (AW): Eir came in at the 11th hour with a proposal that it could provide an alternative to the National Broadband Plan for under (EURO)1bn. You appear to give that plan a lot of credence, despite Eir's track record. Do you believe the company's proposal is a bona fide one? Timmy Dooley (TD): I certainly think that it can deliver broadband an awful lot less expensively than what the National Broadband Plan's procurement process is now delivering. It has succeeded in rolling out high-speed broadband to 300,000 rural homes, so I think it has the capacity to do it. And I think it could be done more cheaply.</p><p>AW: Wouldn't it be an extraordinary coup for Eir, having divided up the NBP intervention area, to come back and persuade the Government to stall or abandon the plan - which itself has probably become more expensive because of that deal to carve out 300,000 rural homes - in favour of a plan allowing it to get the rest on its own terms? And then also to give the company (EURO)1bn of taxpayers' money? TD: That is a valid question. But if I go back to the base principles of what we are trying to achieve here, it's high-speed broadband as quickly and affordably as possible to 542,000 locations throughout the country.</p><p>I felt that the entire process was broken when Eir pulled out. Because with its experience, infrastructure, footprint and scale of business in the country, I could never see how anyone was going to beat it in a procurement process.</p><p>It wasn't allowed to factor in certain resources that it had available to it. When you're asking an incumbent to tie one hand and two legs together and to compete with somebody [Granahan McCourt] who's not in the place at all, just for the purpose of saying we're having a fair competition, the only one that ultimately loses out here is the taxpayer.</p><p>AW: But what you call red tape here is surely department officials being careful with taxpayers' money, isn't it? Don't they have a duty to make sure that the process is as solid and watertight as possible? Would you really go with a potentially lesser standard from a company that many across the political spectrum still blame for Ireland's broadband problems in the first place, ever since it was privatised in 1999? TD: Well, the Department [of Communications] gets defensive when I raise questions about Granahan McCourt and whether or not it has the experience, the capacity, the capability, and all that goes with it. The department says that it will only be paid when it has delivered. And that if the company goes away, or disappears and leaves the country, that we get the assets. The same could apply in a relationship with Eir.</p><p>The minister and the department should be having a much more involved conversation with Eir about this. With the best will in the world, the department has set about building a gold-plated procurement process for very good reasons.</p><p>I don't think the motivation was at all incorrect, particularly because of issues that had happened in the past. There had to be checks and balances. But I think it was overdone.</p><p>I would agree that the privatisation of Eir created a problem. And if we knew then what we now know about the development of the internet and all that goes with it, I certainly don't think it would have been privatised.</p><p>But I go back to the fundamental point. Why would you want to create a separate service for the 500,000 homes that's any different to the 300,000 that are done? AW: But would the prospect of giving Eir a new bigger, longer-term monopoly under those conditions not be something you'd worry about? TD: Why does that matter to the consumer? Eir is a regulated entity. It's not like it would be the Wild West for the 540,000. And you can increase or reduce regulation in line with the rules.</p><p>But the bit that's important to me is there's market failure, so you can intervene, and you do intervene.</p><p>Robert Watt, who has responsibility on the other side for taxpayers, is saying that this can be done more cheaply.</p><p>Setting up this super-structure is going to require a massive amount of unnecessary oversight in my view, because you already have oversight through the regulator.</p><p>AW: You're on the Oireachtas Communications Committee investigating the National Broadband Plan. But the Government looks like it has made its decision and will sign the contract with National Broadband Ireland (Granahan McCourt). Will the deliberations of the committee really matter? TD: They may or they may not. But I am the opposition spokesperson. And I have a responsibility in that role and to the broader public to question and hold the Government to account.</p><p>I suppose I'd be happy in two or three years' time if my analysis at this point was wrong; if Granahan McCourt is rolling out broadband at a rate of knots and people are happy with the service and we get it less expensively than what is currently predicted. I'll happily put my hand up and say, 'you know what, I was overly cautious'. But when I saw Siro pulling out, at that stage I said, it's time to look again at this.</p><p>And it was pushed back by the Government, which said that it would delay the process. That was 18 months ago and they still haven't signed the contract.</p><p>AW: If there was an election in October and you became minister, wouldn't you do a 180-degree turn and run with the current process, in a similar way to how Denis Naughten and then Richard Bruton, both of whom were sceptical about the National Broadband Plan process, got into the ministerial seat? TD: No, I don't think I would. The Department of Finance is saying that we don't have the (EURO)3bn. There are so many other projects around the country that are not funded. We're facing Brexit too.</p><p>There is additional cost here that is not funded three, five years out. And this is a long-term project that requires very significant demand and resources. So it's not there. We could afford the (EURO)1bn [that Eir is proposing].

TD: Yes, there's an existential crisis in traditional media. Advertising revenue has shifted to the digital platforms.</p><p>AW: How much would the tax be? TD: I don't know, but it would probably start off small.</p><p>AW: So would that apply, for instance, to all advertising revenue booked through Google's or Facebook's Irish accounts? TD: It would be Irish revenue. I'm conscious that these digital companies are very well-versed in tax management.</p><p>I would see it as a levy on the Irish advertising component.

I'm not sure what this means for future portfolio returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Janus Capital's Bill Gross, hedge fund titan Paul Singer of Elliott Management Corp, former Office of Management and Budget head David Stockman and prominent hedge fund manager Jim Rogers are only a small sample of the market experts predicting a major slide in equity values. Phrases like \"horrendous storm\" and \"the worst crash of our lifetime\" feature prominently in interviews with these doomsayers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Domestically, investor sensitivity to bad news was borne out by the near-insatiable appetite for \"Is Home Capital the start of a 2008-style financial crisis?\" stories in the Report on Business and elsewhere. In general, we wouldn't be getting all these depictions of a market apocalypse if there wasn't a sizeable audience for them - media organizations don't continue to publish on a theme no one's reading.</p><p>Investors can take some solace in market history - major corrections seldom occur when people are looking for them and everyone's anxiously hovering a finger over the sell button on their keyboard. Concerns about expensive valuations are somewhat mitigated by stronger (and perhaps more importantly) stable profit forecasts. The S&amp;P/TSX price-to-earnings ratio based on trailing earnings is worrisome at 21.1 times, but the forward price earnings ratio of 16.6 is more reasonable, and signals strong earnings growth ahead.</p><p>The late 1990s was a case where a steadily rising number of pundits, analysts and strategists predicted a disastrous end to the tech bubble and turned out to be correct. But outside of Amazon.com Inc., the current market doesn't display the egregiously expensive valuations in the way that Cisco Systems Inc., trading at 140 times trailing earnings, and Oracle Corp. at 106 times, did at the beginning of 2000.</p><p>For investors it's disquieting when familiar faces continually warn of impending portfolio doom. To me, it doesn't feel like a market top but \"a feel\" is all that is. Results from the current second quarter of activity, which will be announced during third quarter of the year, will be vital on both sides of the border, and will give investors more direction. -- Scott Barlow This is the twice a week Globe Investor newsletter.

This stock appears on the positive breakouts list, breaking out to the upside on very high volume - a very bullish move from a technical perspective. This is a stock that is in a multi-year uptrend and any pause in the positive price momentum has proven to be a buying opportunity. The company is an industry leader with a solid growth profile, writes Jennifer Dowty. Recently, the company completed a five-for-one stock split making the share price more affordable for investors. GreenSpace Brands Inc. This stock was last featured in the TSX Breakouts report at the start of the year. At the time, Jennifer Dowty speculated that this micro-cap stock may steadily gain attention from investors as it continues to grow. Since then, three additional firms have initiated coverage on the company and the share price has increased over 22 per cent. This stock is now covered by seven analysts - quite impressive for a micro-cap stock. The stock has an unanimous buy recommendation with analysts forecasting nearly 34-per-cent upside potential. Source Energy Services Ltd. This stock may have thought it got its timing right as it scheduled an early-2017 initial public offering, planning to catch an upswing in sentiment in the sector. Alas, not so much: By the time it went public in April, it had to sharply cut its offering price to $10.50; the shares traded below $7 for the first time this week, making investors losers as well. This sorry state for Source Energy's shares, however, may be an opportunity for those with the longer term in mind. Calgary-based Source Energy is Canada's entry in the surprisingly large category of publicly traded sellers of \"proppants,\" or the sand and materials used in fracking. And there are three factors that could drive Source Energy's earnings up sharply in the next couple of years. David Milstead explains. The Rundown How borrowers, savers and investors can prepare for higher interest rates The Bank of Canada has begun the process of slapping Canadians back to reality on interest rates, writes Rob Carrick. Economic growth is picking up and the central bank made it clear earlier this week that it's looking at whether to raise rates. CIBC Economics sees the bank raising rates by a total 0.5 of a percentage point in the first six months of 2018, or a bit sooner. We've had speculation, off and on, about higher borrowing costs in the past decade or so and rates stayed low. Today, risks to the economic outlook include a correction in the housing market, high household debt levels and weak wage growth. But the U.S. economy has been strong enough lately for rates to start rising, and it looks like Canada could follow the same pattern if our overall economic picture continues to improve. Too high, too fast? Why big tech is slumping Some of the top U.S. technology stocks have been heading straight down over the past two trading days, raising concerns about lofty heights, writes David Berman. But if investors are now growing sensitive to valuation, there are going to be plenty more casualties ahead given that the broader market hardly looks cheap following nine years of gains. Most of the bludgeoning since Friday has been reserved for the highest profile names in the U.S. technology sector - mostly members of the acclaimed FANG group of stocks, largely known for heady growth, massive market capitalizations and stellar share-price gains in recent years. The turning of the Trump trade: Now it's 'Short America' Investor expectations that the U.S. economy was set to re-take global leadership were strengthening well before the American electorate's collective brain cramp in November. Now, however, the optimism has not only faded, but turned to outright pessimism. \"Short America\" has become one of the most popular hedge fund trades, writes Scott Barlow. Mutual fund industry stands up for small investors? Good one The mutual fund industry has just offered a rare show of support for the little guy. It's just for show, though. By acting like it's on the side of what it describes as \"modest investors,\" the Investment Funds Institute of Canada is hoping to head off unwanted rule changes being considered by regulators. The proposal is to stop burying the cost of an adviser's services in the fees charged to own mutual funds and have investors instead pay their advisers directly. Rob Carrick explains. Larry Berman: What a flattening yield curve says about the U.S. economy The shape of the yield curve tells us a lot about investor expectations about the future. As of Sunday night, the odds the U.S. Federal Reserve raises the overnight rate was 97 per cent, according to the derivatives tied to the federal funds rate. In fact, that is the last rate hike the market has priced in at this point despite the Fed suggesting rates will be closer to 3.00 per cent by the end of 2018. Since the Fed started raising interest rates in December, 2015, the yield curve has been flattening. The one exception was in the weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump's election when the markets were excited about Mr. Trump's growth and stimulus plan, which is still quite the mystery. A flattening curve in a combination of short-term interest rates moving up and longer-term interest rates falling suggests the rate hikes are likely to hurt growth and cool the economy. Larry Berman reveals. Federal Reserve poised to hike rates amid uncertain economic outlook The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to raise its key interest rate this week for the third time in seven months, but the outlook for the rest of the year has become clouded by economic uncertainty. Markets are currently pricing in a quarter-percentage-point increase when the Fed announces its decision on Wednesday, which will lift the rate to a range between 1 per cent and 1.25 per cent. Fed chair Janet Yellen will add to the importance of the event by holding a news conference after the release of the policy statement and updated economic projections. David Berman explains more. An investing world where only a handful of stocks move the indexes If you have a broadly diversified portfolio, you're probably holding far fewer good stocks than you think. Chances are your equity earnings, like the stock market itself, are dependent on the runaway returns of a precious few stars counteracting the mediocrity that characterizes the vast majority of public listings. Much has been made lately of the dominance of a few tech champions in upholding U.S. stock indexes. A similar trend is afoot in Canada, with just seven names responsible for all of the index returns so far this year. Tim Shufelt explains. In defence of actively managed portfolios: Value investing works, in multiple ways A new study from Arizona State University, titled Do Stocks Outperform Treasury Bills?, is turning heads and gives ammunition to those who oppose active management to further bash stock pickers. The study, by ASU professor Hendrik Bessembinder, found that over the long run individual stocks have done poorly even though the stock market as a whole has prospered. George Athanassakos looks into the study and what it means. Alberta boosts investment industry regulator's investigative powers One of Canada's investment industry regulators has been granted greater investigative power in the province of Alberta, sparking hope that other provinces will follow suit to help strengthen investor protection. Last Friday, the Alberta legislation amended its securities act, with the passage of Bill 13 - which now provides the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) with legal authority to more effectively investigate and prosecute those who harm investors. Clare O'Hara explains further. Canada's largest mutual-fund firms turn to ETFs After years of being on the sidelines, Canada's largest mutual-fund players are now racing to offer exchange-traded funds in an effort to capitalize on the explosion in popularity of the lower-cost products. But they are facing a dual and formidable challenge: how to attract new investors in an already-saturated market while also ensuring they are not sabotaging the success of their existing fund offerings. Over the past year and a half, seven of Canada's largest asset managers - including Mackenzie Financial Ltd., AGF Management Ltd. and Manulife Financial Corp. - have decided to step out of their comfort zone to add ETF products to their fund lineups. In addition, three smaller mutual-fund providers have also entered the ETF space. Clare O'Hara looks into the reasons behind these moves. A private investor's story George Stockus worked in the investment industry from 1984 to 2002. Bond trading and institutional sales were his specialties. Then he left to spend more time with family and to invest his own account, a move made possible by the gains earned from short selling software and telecom stocks near the end of the technology bubble of the late 1990s. Larry MacDonald looks at what he's investing in now.

Rather than having it sit there as dead money, can you make any recommendations as to how I can still get a return, no matter how small, on this cash? Would a money-market fund make sense? Answer: The problem with money-market funds is that the management expense ratio eats up a big chunk of the already puny yield. A better option are the high-interest savings accounts offered by discount brokers. These products, which currently pay about 0.75 per cent to 0.8 per cent, are bought and sold like mutual funds and can be held in non-registered accounts as well as TFSAs, registered retirement savings plans and other registered accounts. Like regular savings accounts, they're also covered by Canada Deposit Insurance Corp. (with the exception of U.S. dollar savings vehicles). The interest rates aren't huge, obviously, but convenience is a big plus because the money is at your fingertips should you decide to cash out a portion of your savings to invest in stocks, mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. Typically, these products have initial minimum investments of $500 or $1,000. There should be no fees or early-redemption penalties, but be sure to verify this with your discount broker. --John Heinzl Do you have a question for Globe Investor? Send it our way via this form.

And welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're following breaking news on the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Ethiopia's Transport minister says the plane's flight data recorder shows similarities with the crash of the same model Boeing 737 MAX 8 back in October in Indonesia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's get straight to CNN's Richard Quest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Richard, what more are we learning?</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN MONEY EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Well, Fredricka, this was the first indication of connection, similarity, coincidence, whatever we want to say. They've started reading out the data from the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. It's being done by the BEA which is the French regulator. Extremely experienced. And according now to the Ethiopian Transport minister, she's held a press conference in Addis Ababa that there were certain similarities between Lion Air back in October, that particular crash of the 737 MAX, and the Ethiopian 302 flight, the 737 MAX.</p><p>What those similarities are she didn't say. But educated guesses suggest it shows similarities in altitude variation, the speed at which the plane managed to achieve. The altitude that the plane managed to achieve. If you look at Lion Air and Ethiopian, they are very similar. And now it would appear that the black box and data recorders seem to bear out that coincidence.</p><p>Now one other point. Within 30 days under international law, the Ethiopians have to produce a preliminary report. It won't be much detail. It'll just be a page or two long, but it will give the first indications of the avenues the investigation is taking and crucially, Fredricka, it may make the first or can make the first recommendations of what needs to be done.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So will it be Boeing or would it be the FAA who would be most held responsible for either having the data, knowing it, examining it, so as to figure out how to prevent something like this?</p><p>QUEST: The data from the voice recorders will be provided to both, of course, in the fullness of time. Now Boeing is already working on a fix for what they say is necessary for the so-called MCAS. This is the software that's believed to be at the heart of both these crashes. Boeing says it's got a fix. The FAA says it is looking at this but hasn't yet authorized them to test it. The testing could take weeks, if not months.</p><p>So I think both Boeing and the FAA, both have an interest in getting to the bottom of this, but we're a long way from the 737 MAX being back in the air.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And have you learned anything that's in concert with this \"New York Times\" reporting that the opportunity had not been given to pilots to better understand this kind of technology that these Boeing planes had?</p><p>QUEST: This is a -- simply a fact. Certainly before Lion Air, many pilots have been given minimal, basically iPad, training on the differences between the existing 737, 800, 900 -- sorry, NGs, and the new MAX 8 and MAX 9. Very minimal because Boeing believed that the way this technology worked, pilots already knew how to deal with those sort of crises if it went wrong. However, between Lion Air and Ethiopian, well, no pilot should have been flying a 737 MAX that hadn't been made fully aware.</p><p>But here's the rub, Fredricka. The critics will say even with the new information, that wasn't enough. There needed to be special simulator training for the MCAS. There needed to be new simulators with variants specifically for this sort of fault or this sort of mechanics. As far as we know, that never happened between the two crashes.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Richard Quest, thank you so much.</p><p>All right. Now we turn to politics in the U.S. and the White House doing damage control after President Trump's response to the massacre in New Zealand.</p><p>[16:05:03] Fifty people murdered by a man promoting while nationalist ideas. Despite the deadly attack, President Trump still claiming the threat from white nationalism is not on the rise. Now his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, coming to the president's defense.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: The president is absolutely briefed on all the threats, both domestic and international, but I'm going to push back against this idea that every time something bad happens everywhere around the world, folks who don't like Donald Trump seem to blame it on Donald Trump.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: To the degree that there's an issue with white supremacists, white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigotry in this country, and there is an issue with that, why not deliver a speech condemning it?</p><p>MULVANEY: You've seen the president stand up for religious liberties, individual liberties. The president is not a white supremacist. I'm not sure how many times we have to say that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: So all of this happening while the president's focus, according to his Twitter feed, is somewhere else. He's taking aim at the late Senator John McCain just months after his death for his ties to the controversial Russian dossier, on Trump and McCain's notable thumbs down vote on repealing Obamacare.</p><p>CNN White House correspondent Boris Sanchez joining me right now. So let's start with Mick Mulvaney's comments today. It's remarkable the acting chief of staff is the one who has to explicitly say the president is not a white supremacist.</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it certainly is, Fred. Mulvaney clearly annoyed by a question, one that is frequently posed to the White House and defenders of the president, the criticism toward President Trump for his response to this attack in New Zealand is twofold. First many felt that he was wrong when he said he did not believe that white supremacy was on the rise around the world, especially because there's evidence to the contrary.</p><p>And secondly because he didn't explicitly condemn Islamophobia. The president didn't even say that word. Some, like Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, believe the president is not using his platform adequately to promote tolerance. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN: There's real data and information currently, right now, of the rise of white supremacy right here in this United States of America. He needs to look at the data and the information and the facts and actually listen and understand the tremendous responsibility he has in being our president, our leader of our country. He cannot just say it's a small group of people.</p><p>There's too many deaths, not only from the synagogue to the black churches to the temples, to now the mosques. We need to be speaking up against this. And it has to start with him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZAKARIA: Now the White House has pushed back on this sort of criticism previously, saying that the president's admonition of what happened in New Zealand was adequate. However, for perspective, I wanted to point out the president sent out two tweets about the attacks on Friday. He hasn't tweeted about it since. In contrast, the president tweeted three times today defending a FOX News host whose rhetoric last week was deemed anti-Muslim, anti-Islam. And the president was essentially saying that she should stand up for herself and she should stay on the air -- Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And the president also spent some time going after the late U.S. Senator John McCain on Twitter today.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, right. This all goes back to the Steele dossier. John McCain was one of the very first Americans to actually see it, the salacious piece of compiled information during the 2016 election. Some of it, which has been verified, some of it unverified. Still, the president ties that dossier to the start of the Russia investigation.</p><p>John McCain denied that he provided that dossier to journalists, but recently we learned that one of his aides actually handed it over to BuzzFeed News. And some are criticizing the late senator, saying that this stains his legacy, including former independent counsel Kenneth Starr who investigated former President Bill Clinton in the late '90s. Listen to what he told FOX News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He said that he didn't have anything to do with passing on the dossier to the FBI. And yet now we know he did.</p><p>KEN STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL WHO INVESTIGATED PRESIDENT CLINTON: Deeply disappointing. Well, we'll see. That's what the evidence shows. You know, I'm one who keeps saying don't rush to judgment, but that's what the evidence tends to show. And I'm just saying, I'm very, very saddened by this, but John McCain was an American hero who did so much for the country. But this is unfortunately a very dark stain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: So President Trump obviously saw that interview because he quoted it in a tweet and went one step further in explaining his grudge toward the late senator. Look at this tweet that President Trump sent out. He writes, quote, \"Spreading the fake and totally discredited dossier is unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain. Ken Starr, former independent counsel. He had far worse stains than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace,\" the president talking about that vote in 2017 where John McCain voted against a thin repeal and replace bill or rather just a repeal bill of Obamacare.</p><p>[16:10:06] Megan McCain, John McCain's daughter, tweeted back at President Trump, launching this attack. Listen to this. Quote, \"No one will ever love you the way they loved my father. I wish I had been given more Saturdays with him. Maybe spend yours with your family instead of on Twitter obsessing over mine.\"</p><p>Clearly the president's obsession over John McCain and the grudge between the two men continues on even seven months after the late senator's death -- Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Boris Sanchez at the White House, thank you so much.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Thanks.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Let's talk further on this. Joining me now, \"New York\" magazine's Washington correspondent, Olivia Nuzzi, and historian and professor at Princeton University, and CNN political analyst Julian Zelizer.</p><p>Good to see both of you. Julian is also the author of \"Fault Lines: A History of the U.S. Since 1974.\"</p><p>All right, so, Julian, you know, what was your reaction that the acting chief of staff would, you know, say the president is not a white supremacist, not necessarily answering the question that was asked, but making that statement?</p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it's obviously stunning that we need an answer to that question with the president of the United States. But it's either a chaos strategy, where you have the chief of staff and others trying to clean up what the president tries to do, or it's just a strategy, meaning the president is consciously avoiding saying much on this, sending other signals through his chief of staff but himself not sending those signals to his political base. We don't know which it is. But either way, it's not great for the White House.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Olivia, does it become an inadequate, you know, replacement of thought?</p><p>OLIVIA NUZZI, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: Does it become a replacement of --</p><p>WHITFIELD: Does it become adequate that it's Mick Mulvaney who's speaking on behalf of the president as opposed to the president elaborating further?</p><p>NUZZI: No. No. Certainly not. And I think that the FOX News host there was right to ask why the president won't just come out and give a speech about this, but I think unfortunately the obvious answer to that is that he can't. He can't without disavowing what he himself has said previously. Since the campaign, he has said abhorrent things about Muslims. He has used language that I think has contributed to rising tensions into this rise of hate worldwide.</p><p>And he can't give a speech condemning white supremacism and condemning this ideology that led to these 50 deaths, including of a 3-year-old. If he does not take some personal responsibility for the things that he has said. So I think for the time being, the only thing that he can do is send out his surrogates, as he's doing now, while he stays at home and sends tweets about other topics, I think hoping to deflect the conversation elsewhere.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So Mick Mulvaney -- I mean, as this acting chief of staff, you know, he is fiercely defending the president no matter what, at least right now, but it hasn't always, you know, been the case. Here's what Congressman Mulvaney said about Donald Trump back in 2016.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MULVANEY: Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump. I'm doing so as enthusiastically as I can, even though I think he's a terrible human being. But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: So Olivia, is it -- you know, Mulvaney has evolved, now he's in a different position, observes the president differently? I mean, what's the explanation here?</p><p>NUZZI: I doubt that he has evolved and views the president differently, but I think that he got a different opportunity and is feeling the role that he now has. And he's certainly not the only one who has served in this White House who had previously condemned the president. I mean, Kellyanne Conway as a surrogate for the Ted Cruz campaign was very negative about the president back during the Republican primary.</p><p>Raj Shah, former spokesperson for this White House, worked against President Trump in favor of Jeb Bush during the campaign. So it's not unusual, at least for this president, to have people surrounding him who previously were pretty vocal talking out against him.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And then, Julian, one would think that this was kind of, you know, water under the bridge that wasn't going to, you know, resurface. But here we go again with the president insulting now the late U.S. Senator John McCain in a different manner now. You know, via tweet today. Why does he do this? And, you know, why would the president feel that this is advantageous for him?</p><p>ZELIZER: Well, there's the personal grudge element. And it's not about advantageous or strategy. It's about him really holding a grudge against Senator McCain for all his opposition. But it's kind of morphing into his conspiracy theories about politics and Washington and the investigations against him. And now Senator McCain becomes part of that broader story. He's trying to tell his supporters that a lot of Washington is out to get him, and here he's connecting McCain to the dossier, to the investigation. And so there is a logic to it, if you want to look at it politically. And I think you might hear more of it, as distasteful as it is.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So, Olivia, this then would, bottom line, be about re- election.</p><p>[16:15:01] I mean, this would be President Trump speaking to his base, who are on board with, you know, this psychology.</p><p>NUZZI: Yes, I think that looking ahead, he probably is thinking that way, but I think with Trump, it's also -- he knows that the media is going to react very strongly. There are going to be a lot of panels like this one discussing what's wrong with saying something like that about somebody who cannot defend themselves, even though I think Megan McCain, John McCain's daughter, did a fantastic job of being graceful and responding to that comment.</p><p>But I think that he likes to be an agitator, and this is a form of him doing that. And I think there was a good point made just now about him really holding grudges and maybe that explains this a bit. But I think he really does just like to create chaos and create outrage cycles. And again, he's deflecting from the fact that he's not responding adequately to what happened in New Zealand. WHITFIELD: Yes, it's -- yes, changing the subject or at least an attempt.</p><p>Olivia Nuzzi, Julian Zelizer, thank you so much.</p><p>NUZZI: Thanks.</p><p>ZELIZER: Thank you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Still ahead, officials have started releasing the identities of those killed in the New Zealand mosque attack. Some of them children. This as mourners gather at a makeshift memorial to honor those whose lives were lost.</p><p>[16:20:26] WHITFIELD: The death toll in the New Zealand mosque massacre has now climbed to 50. The number of injured also stands at 50. Authorities are now racing to identify all of the victims so that their families can bury them quickly in accordance with Muslim tradition. And across New Zealand, people are creating memorials and tributes to the victims, including this powerful ceremonial dance.</p><p>CNN international anchor Kristie Lu Stout is in Christchurch for us.</p><p>So, Kristie, talk to me about the people who have also assembled for that memorial behind you.</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Yes, Fredricka, it's past 9:00 a.m. in the morning, on a Monday morning here in Christchurch. Many residents returning to work, returning to school, but many of them are coming here to stop and admire, to reflect upon -- you're seeing a couple over there, they were in tears -- and also contributing to this growing floral tribute for the victims of the terrorist attack that took price here on Friday.</p><p>You see flowers. You see handwritten cards, works of art, paper chain, perhaps most poignant are the messages you see from small children written in crayon, messages of love, compassion. One message in marker just had the words \"remember goodness\" on them. And these words are necessary at a time when this community is still in mourning.</p><p>Now 50 people dead as a result of that terrorist attack, 50 wounded, of those 36 are in critical condition including a 4-year-old girl who is fighting for her life. In regards to the victims, we've learned that their remains will finally be returned to their families, so the families can say farewell and the families can prepare the bodies for burial in accordance to Muslim tradition.</p><p>So later today there is a critical cabinet meeting for the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern. One day after the massacre on Friday, she pledged to change the gun laws and she is asking for a ban on semiautomatic weapons. Today we also expect to see a show of force from the police in New Zealand. The police commissioner, he announced over the weekend that there will be a significantly higher presence of security, not just around Christchurch, but around New Zealand on the streets, around businesses and schools, as well as in the skies.</p><p>But, Fredricka, just to bring it back to the scene behind us, what is so remarkable is the fact that the residents here have chosen to respond to an act of terror not with fear, not with hate, but an with outpouring of literally love and compassion. One banner over there saying we stand together with our Muslim brothers and sisters, and adding Christchurch. (INAUDIBLE) is a Maury saying for be strong. Back to you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Kristie Lu Stout, thank you so much, in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p><p>And we'll be right back.</p><p>[16:27:35] WHITFIELD: President Trump coming to the defense of one of his biggest supporters on FOX News today. Janine Pirro's show did not air on Saturday night after sources say she was suspended by FOX for her controversial comments on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Pirro was widely criticized for a segment on her show where she doubted Omar's patriotism because she wears a Muslim head covering called a hijab</p><p>FOX News publicly condemned Pirro's comments, and then today President Trump sent a three-part blistering tweetstorm demanding FOX News bring back Pirro, tweeting in part, \"The losers all want what you have. Don't give it to them. Be strong and prosper. Be weak and die. Stay true.\"</p><p>Brian Stelter, CNN's chief media correspondent and anchor of \"RELIABLE SOURCES\" joining me right now.</p><p>So, Brian, you know, what more are you learning about this suspension?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yes. This is a very unusual situation to FOX News. The network rarely takes action against any if its stars or commentators. But in this case with Pirro, the executives clearly believe she went too far this time last week. So as you mentioned, her program did not air this weekend. It is unclear if it's going to air next weekend or not.</p><p>FOX is not commenting. But a source familiar with the matter told me that she was, in private, suspended. That's why her show was not on this weekend. FOX is not confirming that publicly. My source says she's not been fired, but she has been suspended. And that's a rare step for FOX to take. You look at the president's Twitter feed about this, his comments about FOX, as you mentioned, a three-part statement about FOX.</p><p>He is openly telling FOX what to do.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Right.</p><p>STELTER: It's like he's giving free advice to the network that he likes so much. I think he's trying to get through to the Murdochs, the men who control FOX News, trying to say to them, be strong, don't give into the ad boycotts, don't give into the pressure from some progressives. You know, a lot of people have looked at the Omar situation, Pirro talking about Omar, just saying this isn't about politics. It's about basic American values. But in any case, the president making clear where he stands. Frankly, Fredricka, he seems more fired up about this than about the rise of white nationalism or the other issues that you've been covering all afternoon.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Right. You took the words right out of my mouth. So is this for show? Is the president saying this, you know, placing demands on FOX as a show or does, you know, feel that he actually might influence their decision?</p><p>STELTER: I think this is a demonstration of his vulnerability. You know, the president knows he's under investigation on multiple fronts, knows there are a number of scandals that continue to consume his presidency. I think he really recognizes the importance of these pro- Trump talk shows like Jeanine Pirro's, Tucker Carlson's.</p><p>[16:30:01] He recognizes the importance of these shows to keeping up his base, to keeping his base as solid as possible.</p><p>So I think he's actually legitimately concerned when someone like Pirro is not on the air, supporting him no matter what, demanding that, you know -- defending him no matter what. I think he's concerned about that. Some people look at his tweets and they say the president's fearless. He does -- he says whatever he wants. I look at it and I am thinking to myself, he's worried about something.</p><p>He's on a tweet storm, a rant this weekend, because he's worried about something that's coming, whether it's the Mueller report or something else. I think when he's concerned about someone like Jeanine Pirro, it shows his vulnerability.</p><p>FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Yeah. He wants as mouthpieces as...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Brian Stelter, thank you so much.</p><p>STELTER: Thank you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Still ahead, Joe Biden's oops moment, or was it an oops, so when he almost spilled the beans on his presidential plans.</p><p>[16:35:02] WHITFIELD: New today, the Democratic field for president just got bigger. New York Senator, Kristen Gillibrand, jumps into the 2020 race.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We need a leader who makes big, bold... UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Brave.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Choices, someone who isn't afraid of progress. That's why I am running for president.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Gillibrand's announcement pushes the crowded field of Democratic hopefuls to an even dozen. And she may not be the last Democrat to throw her hat into the ring, as former Vice President Joe Biden almost announced he's running.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- if anybody who would run.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Several of the Democratic candidates who have decided and announced officially, the presidential runs are out on the campaign trail today. Senator Elizabeth Warren is campaigning in the south today. The Massachusetts Democrat is in Memphis, where she will hold an organizing event in about an hour. And the campaign stop is part of a three-state tour of the south. She's taking over the next few days.</p><p>Tomorrow, she will hold a CNN town hall in Mississippi. And then she heads to Alabama. CNN Senior Political Analyst Mark Preston is in Jackson, Mississippi, where Warren's CNN town hall will be held tomorrow night. So Mark, why is Warren campaigning, spending this, you know, vital time in these southern states right now that are not part of the early states to hold caucuses and primaries?</p><p>MARK PRESTON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, there's something to be said about getting out of the log jam right now with the Democrats who are up in New Hampshire and Iowa, trying to vie for the attention of those voters. We know Elizabeth Warren has spent a considerable amount of time in New Hampshire and Iowa already. For her to come down here to the south, though, is very symbolic but also strategic in many ways.</p><p>Strategically, because when you get to next year and to 2020, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee are all going to play an important role in the first couple of states that actually vote for the Democratic nomination. Of course, this will come after we see the first four states vote, New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada.</p><p>But again, where we sit here in Mississippi, a very important state in the Democratic primary, but symbolically, too, though, Fred, because she's reaching out to a constituency that's very important to Democratic politics, and that, of course, is African-Americans. We're here on this very storied, historic campus of Jackson State University here in Jackson, Mississippi.</p><p>It's a historic -- historical black college and university. So she's clearly trying to send a message as she sweeps through the south, as you said. In Arkansas today, and moving her way down, all the way through -- or rather, Tennessee and down into Mississippi tomorrow, then of course over to Alabama and up to Birmingham on Tuesday. So -- symbolic, but she's certainly looking for votes, Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And, Mark, then there's Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who officially jumped into the race today. That makes about a dozen Democrats now running for president. So how is, you know, Warren trying to distinguish herself from the pack and, you know, Gillibrand as well?</p><p>PRESTON: Well, you know, interesting. Let me answer it for Elizabeth Warren in a way that she was asked about whether or not she was a Democratic socialist, something that is embraced by Bernie Sanders or a socialist Democrat, however you want to say. When asked that question, Elizabeth Warren turned and said listen. He -- Bernie Sanders can explain what he means by that.</p><p>The centrist Democrats can explain whatever they're trying to do. And I am going to explain what I am trying to do. Now, of course, what she's trying to do is considered very liberal in many ways. But she does -- when she's looking at the markets, when she's looking at Wall Street, as much as she wants to rein them in and she wants to break up big tech, big banks and what have you, she does understand the power of the market, so she says.</p><p>So perhaps we'll hear her explain that a little bit more tomorrow. And of course, Kirsten soldier and -- Kirsten Gillibrand is somebody who is really vying for that middle to left lane right now, trying to reach out to Democratic activists that are certainly needed to get their support. And she's somebody who's really going to need that support in a state like Iowa and New Hampshire as well.</p><p>And perhaps she could play well in those states, but we'll see. You know, Kirsten Gillibrand has kind of been in. She makes it official. And now we'll see that she is fully dedicated to running for president, Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Mark Preston, thank you so much, in Jackson, Mississippi. And be sure to watch tomorrow when Massachusetts Senator and Democratic presidential candidate, Elizabeth Warren, takes to the stage there for the CNN town hall. Hear her messages. That's tomorrow night, 9:00 eastern, here on CNN.</p><p>[16:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: The accused gunman in the New Zealand mosque attack bringing attention to a particular symbol of hate. The suspect appeared to flash a hand sign that traditionally means OK, but has increasingly been adopted by white supremacists and neo-Nazis. It's also been used by internet trolls in an attempt to spur reaction from liberals.</p><p>Joining me right now to discuss this is CNN National Correspondent Sara Sidner. Sara, good to see you, so tell us more about this symbol that he appeared to hold up. SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Look. So this is one of those things that has come into our culture, partly because of social media. But when, you know, we spend some time because this is (Inaudible) it's what we look into, it's what we research, looking on social media websites of the white supremacists or altright or neo- Nazis, and what you will find is this was that was initially -- it's an international symbol for OK.</p><p>I am good. Like, I affirm what you're saying. Everything is good. What they have done with it, though, is try and use it for another purpose, one, to troll people. And by trolling, I mean that if somebody does it and they're doing it because they're trying to show white power -- and I will give you an example of what that means.</p><p>[16:45:07] This is a W, right? You put your fingers like this and this could be a P, right? What they're trying to say is, yes, actually, we are affirming white power. But they'll always say, if you say, well, are you holding up a symbol, a white power symbol, are you a white supremacist? They'll say, oh, no, everyone does it. You're so stupid. You're someone from the left that's trying to make us look bad.</p><p>You're someone from the left trying to make white folks look bad. And so they use it against the people who try and point out that this seems odd. If you look at what the Southern Poverty Law Center has said about it, it's that, yes, it was initially used to sort of troll people from the white nationalists, but it is also a secret hand sign that is used amongst each other to affirm that they are white supremacists or white nationalists or members of the altright.</p><p>And I want to give you some examples of that. So you see this terrorist, this suspect in the killings in the mosque in New Zealand. You see him holding it up. And that's him right there. Now, you see his right hand is making that symbol. And he was well familiar with social media and some of the tropes and some of the hand signals that were being used.</p><p>If you read his manifesto, he talks about some of the folks in the white nationalist movement and his support of white supremacy. Now, I want to show you a couple of other pictures. We have Richard Spencer, who is a known member of the alternative right or altright, who has lots of white nationalist and white power views. There he is standing in front of Trump International Hotel. And he's making that sign.</p><p>Again, his response if someone came at him and said that's a white nationalist sign. He'd say, don't be ridiculous. I am just saying OK. You know I like Donald Trump. So it's interesting to note. And that was a year ago or so. And then here's someone else, Milo Yiannopoulos. Most people know sort of his views. He is continuously making jokes, making, you know, racist and misogynistic sometimes jokes and \"anti-semitic jokes.\"</p><p>And there he is with the Make America Great Again hat and doing that sign. So again, it's got almost a double meaning. One, it's kind of a secret thing between, you know, people in the white nationalist movement. But it's also a way to try and make people who stand up against that look silly for saying, what, you're making the OK sign into something to do with white power?</p><p>But it certainly is there and it's certainly being used by white supremacists, white nationalists, altright, whatever name you want to give them, people who are xenophobic, people who are, you know, anti- Muslim, anti-black, anti, anti, anti, anti-Jewish. You see it over and over and over again. That's something that is true and real, but it's also used against people who point it out.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yeah. Pretty terrible, too, because it's a sign that so many people universally use. And now, this is helping to promote a whole lot more confusion.</p><p>SIDNER: Yes.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Sara Sidner, thank you so much.</p><p>SIDNER: Sure.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Still ahead, a sneak peek at the CNN original series, Tricky Dick, and why you'll get an inside view of Richard Nixon's presidency like never before.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: This week's CNN Hero struggled with depression after losing her dad when she was just 14. Since then, she has dedicated herself to helping children overcome their grief.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My name is Bella and my dad died.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kids in grief are kids at risk. Time does not heal all wounds. Time helps, but it's what you do with that time, and what you need to do is mourn.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you hear other people's stories, it kind of brings comfort.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So that's why a place like Imagine exists, to give children a place to mourn their loss and find out that they're not alone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Gosh, to meet some of the families Mary Robinson is helping, and to nominate perhaps someone you think should be a CNN Hero, go to CNNheroes.com. All right, virtually, no politician in American history experienced the same kind of rise, fall, incredible comeback, and ultimate destruction as Richard Nixon.</p><p>Now, an all-new, four-part CNN original series, Tricky Dick, explores the life and career of the 37th president and offers insights into the parallels between the Nixon presidency and events taking place during the Trump administration today. Here now is a preview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't give a god damn what the story is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Richard M. Nixon has lied repeatedly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No reporter from the Washington Post should ever be in the White House again. Do you understand?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The tougher it gets, the cooler I get. I have what it takes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Impeach Nixon now. Impeach Nixon now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to say this to the television because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I am not a crook.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This crap about Watergate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let others wallow in Watergate. We're going to do our job.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am going to kick their ass. Nobody is going to package me. Nobody is going to make me put on an act for television. I am not going to engage in any gimmicks or any stunts, wear any silly hats. If people looking at me say that's a new Nixon, then all that I can say is, well, maybe you didn't know the old Nixon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:54:57] WHITFIELD: All right. Joining us right now is CNN Presidential Historian, Tim Naftali. He's also the former Director of the Nixon Presidential Library and was a consultant on the series Tricky Dick. Good to see you again. OK, so this series, I mean, we're all looking so much forward to this. We've heard it from so many viewers.</p><p>You know it really lets us hear Richard Nixon in his own voice from media interviews to candid moments caught on camera to this secret recording. So how impactful is it to hear him, to hear his thoughts?</p><p>TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Well, Fred, this is a show, a four-part show that covers his life and career with no narrator, no talking heads, no interpreters or guides. It's primarily Nixon talking to all of you. It's both the public Nixon and the private Nixon. And so what I think will happen is many people will actually be learning more about Richard Nixon and getting an understanding of why he dominated our political imagination for nearly half a century.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Hmm. Because I think when people hear the word Nixon, their minds automatically go to Watergate. But you're here to, you know, share with us there is so much more to his political career.</p><p>NAFTALI: Well, it's a four-part series. And it's not a four-part series about Watergate.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Right.</p><p>NAFTALI: We -- the team used oral histories that were made for the first Nixon foundation in the 1970s by people who went to school with Richard Nixon, who remember him as a boy. So this is about his growing up in (Inaudible) California and his time in (Inaudible). And it's also about his early political career. It's as complete a package, a Nixon package, as possible given the vintage video, the films, and the tapes that we have available.</p><p>You will hear Richard Nixon a lot. And I am sure that much of what you hear, you've never heard before.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Hmm. What are the parallels that you see of Nixon and the Trump administration?</p><p>NAFTALI: Well, there -- let's make it clear that in this film, there is no narrator telling you this is a parallel. I think that viewers will see parallels in Nixon's dislike for the press, in Nixon's private thoughts about his opponents, his anger, his bitterness, and yes, his hate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: And even some word choice.</p><p>NAFTALI: His word choice. But also, you will see the tensions in America at the time, the divisions that we unfortunately have today. They weren't the same in the 70s, but it was a very passionate, very divisive time. And unfortunately, I think people will see parallels to today in that.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Hmm. Well, will they also see some real marked differences?</p><p>NAFTALI: Well, a couple of things. First of all, the Trump story, we don't know the Trump story as well.</p><p>WHITFIELD: It's ongoing.</p><p>NAFTALI: We -- it's not only ongoing, but Richard Nixon hid much of his private self and the tapes revealed it. I don't know, and I don't think anyone but Mister -- President Trump and his family would know the difference between the public, social media Trump, and the real Trump. We now know the difference between the public President Nixon and the private Nixon. And the viewers will see that dramatically displayed in this four-part series.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Wow. So we're certainly hearing, you know, what all of us as viewers could learn from this series. But what do you suppose President Trump would actually learn from this series?</p><p>NAFTALI: Well, I -- what I hope he doesn't learn is how to conceal your private self better. What he might learn is that what happened to Nixon was that overtime -- the fact that the public caught on to the lack of credibility and to his lies hurt him politically, that though until the end of his days, have a strong group of supporters. They weren't enough to keep him in power.</p><p>And that's why he resigned. So one lesson perhaps the president might draw from this, if he took the time to watch it, is that overtime, lies corrode political bases.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Tim Naftali, thank you so much. Always good to see you, appreciate it. And be sure to watch Tricky Dick premiering tonight, 9:00 eastern only on CNN. Thanks so much for being with me this Sunday. I am Fredricka Whitfield. The news continues now with Ana Cabrera.</p><p>ANA CABRERA, CNN ANCHOR: You're live in the CNN Newsroom. I am Ana Cabrera in New York. And this is a weekend when an entire nation, an ally of the United States, is struggling under the agony of the worst act of gun violence in its history.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Or at least a good one-night stand.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Denise Kersten Wills with Melissa Davenport, Sonia Harmon, Hillary Jackson, Eleni Savopoulos, and Lauren Sloat</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Easy E is elated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tall and tan with a prominent brow and a Cheshire-cat grin, he bounds up to the outdoor table where a dozen of his friends sit at the Starboard, the bar that serves as home base for the party crowd at Dewey Beach. Most of the group finished work early Friday afternoon in Washington and hit the road for Dewey. Wearing coverups over bathing suits, they're recuperating from last night's drinking bout while warming up for today's marathon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's only 11 on Saturday morning, yet Easy E already has hooked up. \"I just made out with a blonde!\" he yells.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His friends seem mildly amused. Easy E established his reputation as the house player early in the summer-his first in Dewey-and his antics don't surprise them anymore.</p><p>Every Friday, this group convenes at the house it rents for the summer. For $1,250 each, members get a place to crash and a fridge full of beer from Memorial Day through Labor Day. There's no guarantee of a bed or a hot shower, but finding friends who want to party is a sure thing. And by late June, they've formed a close bond.</p><p>They hop on the same merry-go-round of Dewey bars and restaurants each weekend: tacos at the Lighthouse on Friday, breakfast at the Starboard on Saturday, live music at the Bottle &amp; Cork in the afternoon, and drinks at the Starboard or Rusty Rudder Saturday night. Then it's back to the Starboard for Suicide Sunday brunch, which features Bloody Marys.</p><p>\"Each weekend is the best weekend ever,\" says Kristen, a 27-year-old from DC.</p><p>Still hung over, she scans the breakfast menu's 20 shooters and six morning cocktails. She orders a Bullshark-orange and raspberry vodkas, Champagne, orange and cranberry juice, and Red Bull. \"It's the hair of the dog,\" she says.</p><p>Easy E wants to show off his morning conquest. \"It's her first time in Dewey,\" he says. \"I'll bring her over and prove it.\"</p><p>Art, a 28-year-old from Arlington, watches as Easy E heads out in search of the woman. \"He always goes for Dewey virgins,\" Art says.</p><p>Easy E-it's an old nickname revived this summer-is 33 and works as a manager at a big tech company in Northern Virginia. At Dewey, he doesn't talk about work. No one does. The point is to park your car, ignore your e-mail, and forget about the \"real world\" on the other side of the Bay Bridge.</p><p>Dewey is spring break for adults, a Neverland for recent college grads, young professionals, and even some middle-agers closing in on their AARP years. If you want to wear a stick-on mustache to the bar or do shots of J\u00e4germeister at noon or make out with a stranger in public, you've come to the right place.</p><p>As one fortysomething Dewey regular says, \"It's a no-consequences weekend for people with high-stress jobs.\"</p><p>Easy E takes his vacation from the real world further than most. He has \"Dewey girlfriends,\" regular hookups he doesn't see or talk to anywhere else. He even has separate Facebook identities. His official profile, which he shares with colleagues, includes just one photo of him, in a business suit. His private profile has more than 1,200 pictures, many chronicling adventures in Dewey.</p><p>The bar is starting to get crowded. Art tries to strike up a conversation with a couple of women only to realize he met them last night. The details are foggy. He turns back to his housemates.</p><p>\"Tip back your head and open your mouth!\" he yells to Kristen. He pours Champagne from a bottle with a spout into her mouth. She holds up her hand for him to stop, but not soon enough, and foam sprays across the table.</p><p>Kristen's housemates laugh and get ready for their turn. Soon everyone's buzzed and covered in cheap bubbly.</p><p>As promised, Easy E returns with the blonde, but she seems drunk and slightly alarmed and disappears soon after he introduces her to the gang.</p><p>Damn. Easy E can't believe it. He'd been planning to take her back to the group house for some midday fun.</p><p>A few blocks away, lifeguards with the Dewey Beach Patrol scan the ocean waves from high above the sand. They're the town's first responders to emergencies on or off the beach, but mostly in the bars. One of the rare beach rescues in recent memory happened a few years ago.</p><p>\"I was sitting on the Dickinson Street stand,\" recalls Dan Mazer, a tan 21-year-old from Newark, Delaware. \"A sailboat kept coming too close to shore. We whistled at it, but usually in situations like that, it means someone's had a heart attack.\"</p><p>The boat-which he says was a 60-foot, $1.5-million yacht-crashed into shore. \"When we get on it,\" he continues, \"there is a man passed out at the steering wheel. He's British and he's naked, with a bottle of Scotch in one hand.\"</p><p>The lifeguards found his mistress below deck. Both were so drunk that they had to put on flotation gear before wading into the shallow water.</p><p>Today things are quiet, though it's a sunny, breezy afternoon. The beach used to be the epicenter of Dewey partying, back in the days that longtime Dewey regulars still talk about.</p><p>You could bury a keg in the sand, light a bonfire, and do pretty much whatever you wanted. There were people sleeping on the beach or running naked up and down Route 1.</p><p>The town was incorporated in 1981 and banned drinking on the beach five years later, making its lovely stretch of sand almost an afterthought to some. One seven-year Dewey veteran says he hasn't made it to the beach in three years.</p><p>Families with toddlers and teens are interspersed with the singles on the beach. The town is trying to market itself as a family destination, with free movies and a weekly bonfire.</p><p>But the families mostly disappear on weekend nights, when Dewey belongs to the singles. The town may be tamer than it once was, but it's still one giant frat party in comparison with quiet Bethany to the south and kid-friendly Rehoboth to the north. The drinking has just moved into the bars.</p><p>\"The vibe here is out of control,\" says a 24-year-old bouncer at the Lighthouse, a large waterfront bar. \"Every night is a different story.\"</p><p>His favorite stories star \"cougars,\" or women who prey on younger men. \"They like dirty talk and want to go home with us,\" he says. \"Here, women over 30 can let go of their inhibitions and have a one-night stand.\"</p><p>There's no word for the male equivalent of the cougars, but they prowl Dewey bars, too. \"Do I want to have sex with 20-year-olds?\" ponders one 48-year-old man from Fairfax. \"Yeah, but not every weekend.\"</p><p>Another Lighthouse bouncer, 23 years old, saw a record-fast pickup earlier this summer. \"A girl walked up to a guy and said, 'I want to make out.' And they walk out holding hands,\" he says. \"Later, I caught them on the back stairway . . . doing it.\"</p><p>\"Hi, ladies. Hey, I said hello. The least you can do is come over here and say hello.\"</p><p>Easy E is attempting to lure women in bikinis to his beach towel and from there back to the house. He and Art carry cameras carefully wrapped in plastic bags to protect them from the sand. If they don't capture a conquest in photos, it's almost as if it didn't happen.</p><p>So far there hasn't been much to document. The boys have positioned themselves near a group of women in town for a bachelorette party.</p><p>The women who share their house are there, too. Hookups between members of the house are frowned upon because they create \"drama,\" which at Dewey is to be avoided at all costs. One house has a rule: No making out with housemates until August 1. After that-so close to the end of the summer-intra-house hooking up is okay.</p><p>Of course, rules are meant to be broken. Last night, two of Easy E's housemates ended up together. But it's an option of last resort.</p><p>For now, Easy E is focused on the bachelorette and her friends, even after he realizes most of them are married.</p><p>Art turns to Easy E: \"Hey, remember that weekend when you hooked up with two bachelorettes and that one married lady?\" </p><p>Easy E beckons to the bride-to-be. \"You're gonna cheat on your fianc\u00e9 this weekend, sweetheart,\" he says. But she giggles and walks away.</p><p>One of Easy E's housemates, a 34-year-old from Wilmington, is dating a girl he met Memorial Day weekend. He tries to save money by meeting up with his girlfriend late in the evening, after she's been drinking for a while. Let some other dude pay for her alcohol.</p><p>Drinks aren't cheap. Dewey's signature cocktail, the Orange Crush, tastes like a Creamsicle and costs $6. The Lighthouse sells so many that it goes through 100 cases of oranges in a weekend.</p><p>\"I try to limit myself to $300 every weekend,\" the housemate says. \"But I end up blowing $500.\"</p><p>Tired of striking out, Easy E opts for a new strategy: \"I say we get up, find a new place, and pretend we've just arrived at the beach. And this time, no rings!\"</p><p>At the Rusty Rudder that night, the cover band Burnt Sienna is rocking.</p><p>Lead singer Jeff Ebbert, a.k.a. Jefe-pronounced Hef\u00e9-jumps around the stage in designer jeans and a T-shirt. Tall and lean with buzzed hair, he's the favorite of the women who pack the floor in front of the stage.</p><p>The police enforce noise limits at Dewey bars, but the music-covers of everything from the Jackson 5 to Kanye West-blares so loudly that you can't stand anywhere near the speakers. In the crowd, a couple of fortysomethings make out like teenagers.</p><p>Burnt Sienna does gigs in Arlington, too. Many of the same people show up there, Jefe says, but they get wilder in Dewey. This is the band's favorite place to play; nowhere does it get better rock-star treatment.</p><p>Each of the five band members makes between $50,000 and $100,000 a year plus perks from their adoring fans. At Jefe's invitation, \"Bachelorette Amanda\" and her party climb onstage. Several start grinding with band members, rubbing up against them. One sits on the drummer's lap, facing him, and bounces up and down.</p><p>\"My drummer is getting the best lap dance of his life!\" Jefe yells to the crowd.</p><p>Jefe, who's been in the band 11 years, says it's important to keep the women happy. Where girls go, guys follow. He's in his thirties and is married to a nurse, but he doesn't wear his wedding band while performing.</p><p>\"I think if [girls] see a wedding ring without knowing us, they might think, 'Oh, these guys are older-as soon as this is over, they're hopping in a minivan, going home, and changing diapers.' That's not true. I'll probably be playing beer pong at 5 in the morning.\"</p><p>Girls frequently hit on the guys in the band. As lead singer, Jefe gets the worst of it. Most approaches are subtle-an invitation to a late-night party or a phone number on a piece of paper-but there's a lot of groping, too. \"I have a line,\" Jefe says. \"If somebody grabs my junk, they're going to hear about it.\"</p><p>Does he get sick of being in a cover band? No way. This is his dream job. But it won't last forever.</p><p>\"There's gonna come a time when we're too old to be playing the newest song on the radio to 21-year-old girls,\" he says. When that time comes, he'll focus on weddings and corporate events, which pay more. \"I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon,\" he says.</p><p>The crowd goes nuts at the start of a 2006 hit inspired by a Paris Hilton sex tape. \"Hey! You're a crazy bitch,\" Jefe sings, \"but you f--- so good I'm on top of it.\" Everyone sings along.</p><p>Kristen Evick, a patrol officer with the Dewey Beach Police since April, is parked outside the Rusty Rudder, preparing for \"bar rush\" when the bars close at 1 am.</p><p>There's some griping about what's seen as increased police enforcement. \"They've really clamped down on this place-it sucks,\" complains a fiftysomething taxi driver who misses the days when Dewey was all about \"sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.\"</p><p>But Evick and her colleagues-eight year-round officers plus dozens of student police as young as 18 brought in to help control the summer crowds-rarely intervene in the nightly parade of inebriation.</p><p>\"See, she's drunk.\" Evick points to a woman stumbling as she tries to put on her shoes. \"It's absolutely hilarious.\"</p><p>Another woman who's clearly intoxicated runs up to the passenger window for help getting to the beach. She wants to cut through tall grass on the side of the road, but Evick explains she can't go that way. Besides, the beach is closed at night.</p><p>The most common arrests in Dewey are for underage drinking and for urinating in public, Evick says. The police are also strict on open alcohol containers and drunken jaywalking across Route 1.</p><p>\"For the most part, the people down here are decent,\" Evick says. Treat them well and they'll return the favor. The town council wants tourists to have a good time and come back, she adds.</p><p>\"The police are told to enforce the law but do it with some common sense,\" says Dewey commissioner Dale Cooke. \"Don't go crazy, and don't let them go crazy.\"</p><p>Those who say Dewey is rowdy now have no idea what it was like in the '80s, says town manager Gordon Elliott. When he was a patrolman then, kids threw firecrackers at him from a roof. \"They were rolling around the brim of the big Smokey Bear hat I used to wear,\" he says.</p><p>\"You'd be picking up people in the morning just laying in the street from where they were intoxicated,\" he says. \"That doesn't happen much anymore.\"</p><p>Noise regulations-the police have handheld noise meters so they can write tickets-make parties of more than 15 or 20 people virtually impossible, Elliott says. \"It used to be 200 or 300 people staying in the yard of a house.\"</p><p>At 1:15, Evick gets a call and speeds off. She arrives at a house where music is blasting. A guy living in the street got into a fight with three others. His face is bloody, and it looks like his nose is broken. When an ambulance arrives, he refuses to go to the hospital, seemingly too drunk to know how badly he's hurt.</p><p>After much cajoling, Evick persuades him to get treatment, saying that if he doesn't go, she'll lock him up.</p><p>When others at the party move in to take pictures with the police car and the ambulance, one of the officers loses his patience: \"Just go in the house before you go to jail.\"</p><p>After the bars close, Easy E stops for late-night pizza and heads back to the house, a rough-around-the-edges four-bedroom with 12 beds and a beer-pong table. He still hasn't figured out who tonight's lucky lady will be, and the clock is ticking.</p><p>Earlier in the evening, his housemates were playing beer pong, a game involving a Ping-Pong ball and chugging, when a guest wandered onto an upstairs balcony.</p><p>\"There's a human body out here!\" she yelled.</p><p>A guy was lying passed out, his face pressed against the sliding glass door. No one recognized him. They eventually got him up and realized he was a friend of a friend.</p><p>Now a girl is passed out, mouth agape, on a couch beneath a bright lamp and in front of a speaker blasting music.</p><p>\"Dooooowheeeeeee! Dooooowheeeeeee!\" shouts Kate, a 25-year-old teacher from Arlington. Another housemate is pouring shots of Southern Comfort and lime, dancing around the living room as he hands them out. Others are trying to get another game of beer pong going.</p><p>By 10 the next morning, the gang is back at the Starboard, nursing hangovers with Eggs Delmarva and make-your-own Bloody Marys.</p><p>They laugh when women who look to be in their late fifties arrive in tight white T-shirts with sayings like crzy btch or gr8 fuk on the back. One, whose shirt says nauty bch chck, is wearing high heels but no pants.</p><p>Kristen has had more than enough Dewey for one weekend; she needs to get out of here before the Champagne starts flowing again. She leaves money for breakfast and heads off without saying goodbye.</p><p>The rest of the housemates rehash last night. Two friends brought girls home only to find they were lesbians. Others can't remember parts of the night.</p><p>Easy E's luck finally turned around when a leggy blonde wandered into the house around 2. They started making out on the kitchen counter and moved on from there. He's got photos to prove it. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Women hanging out in Dewey Beach sometimes get a little wild. \"My drummer is getting the best lap dance of his life,\" said Burnt Sienna singer Jeff Ebbert during a hot summer show.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photograph by Jennifer Smoose</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>The beach was party central until the town banned drinking there in 1986.

Because millions of Australians each day use the Internet, they use social media platforms, they use digital platforms, and I want them to be safe. I know for many that it might seem that when these summits are held, people wonder why people come from so far and they gather together to talk about these issues but I can tell you that when one in five of your jobs are dependent on trade when there are complex issues that are going on with our global economy, whether there are the threats that can reach out and touch the lives of Australians through digital platforms, well, you've got to be. And I appreciate the invitation from President Macron to be here, to be able to participate and put Australia's perspective and contribution on these issues. And we have been making a contribution. I've just come from the session that was dealing with the digital technology issues and I was so encouraged by the tremendous support that we've had, not just for when we went to Osaka with the G20 declaration, but now following that up here and also following it up with the OECD so we are actually putting some tools in place which can assist all countries and we are taking the measures, as Australian journalists will know that we're taking home, to deal with these issues.So it has been a good opportunity over the last two days to focus on Australia's national interest and how that fits in with what is happening elsewhere in the world. These are quite unique opportunities. As an Australian Prime Minister, I always prefer to be in Australia dealing with issues on the ground domestically. But these events are necessary and have provided Australia, I think, a good opportunity. Whether it's my first formal meeting with Boris Johnson today, which was both an enjoyable and very lively affair and very useful too. Including also meeting with Prime Minister Modi on the margins of the discussions, as well as Prime Minister Trudeau where we particularly discussed the issues around both of our interests in Hong Kong. And the Prime Minister of Italy, they're going through many changes there. But there was a continuity in the relationships between our economies. I was particularly pleased with Australia's actions on establishing the National Space Agency. The Australian Space Agency in Adelaide has actually been noticed and I'm thrilled about that. And there was a keenness, both in the United Kingdom and from Italy, to engage with us so I have no doubt Premier Marshall, pardon the pun, will be over the moon when it comes to the Space Agency initiatives. And so there has been a lot of opportunity to push some business forward here for Australia and so I'm very appreciative of the opportunity we've had and happy to take any questions.JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you encouraged by the apparent detente between the U.S and China over trade?PRIME MINISTER: Well I am. I am encouraged. I am pleased. But I am also mindful that we've been here before. But I'd much rather be in this situation and I'm pleased that China has responded and it's coming back and will then work with the United States. As I said yesterday, the issue is having an obvious impact on the global economy and I'm pleased to see that they're going to try and move things forward. Yesterday we saw Japan and the United States come to an agreement. I'm pleased, having spoken to Prime Minister Abe today, that that arrangement also protects Australia's interests and the arrangements we have with Japan and that's welcome news. We've been having a tremendous relationship with Japan and so I appreciate the fact that as a result of that relationship that we ensure both of their undertakings to Australia can be met at the same time, we have been able the make the undertaking to the United States.JOURNALIST: As you say, we've been in this place before. We were in this place just 8 weeks ago. Do you think there is going to be any genuine progress this time?PRIME MINISTER: Well, you can only hope so. But as President Trump often says, let's just see what happens. And I think that's the situation we are in. But I'm always hopeful that they can come to an [inaudible]. And as I said yesterday, it's the product of our economy going into a new phase globally. China has grown, and that means that the arrangements that we have in trade or whether it's emissions reduction or the global responsibility and the relationships people have, this all changes too. So this is a moment for that to re-gear and let's hope that something can be concluded in the bilateral trading relationship between the US and China.JOURNALIST: Next year\u2019s the Summit is set to be hosted by the United States, potentially even at Donald Trump's own property. Would you be hoping to score an invite along to the G7 in 2020?PRIME MINISTER: Well look, I'm not one who rushes for the plane to attend summits. That's not my style. I'd much prefer to be back working on issues domestically because we've got a lot of issues we've got to focus on domestically. While these events are necessary, my focus is always on Australia's national interest at home. We'll be in Washington next month and this has been another opportunity, I think, to reinforce the wonderful relationship we have with the United States. We have a common view on so many issues and that's because our interests are just so aligned. We are for a free world where people could get on about their lives and America have always championed that and that's why we have such a strong values connection.JOURNALIST: From the digital transformation stuff today and encouraging tech companies to voluntarily report extremist content being taken down. Are you happy with the support you're receiving from the United States? Because it looked on post-feed like Donald Trump didn't even turn up to that session?PRIME MINISTER: No he was\u2026 I just came from that session, he was very supportive. And I appreciate all of the country's support here at the G7 for that initiative. Both Prime Minister Modi and I spoke to that matter, it's one of the reasons we were both here. And there is very strong support because look, it's a simple proposition. It actually is really simple. The rules in the digital world have to be the same as the rules in the physical world. What we expect of companies in the physical world you should expect from companies in the digital world. I mean, you don\u2019t go and let a company put a dodgy product, a kid's toy, on a shelf and let them buy it and then swallow it and choke to death do you? You don't. You have proper laws that protect people from those sorts of things. Digital companies are no different. They have to take responsibility for what they produce and the services they provide and making sure they don't harm people. And this is just a simple process of ensuring that the digital world's rules reflect the physical world's rules. Not more, not less, just the same. And it's just a product of the world responding to this changing and amazing technology. We also recognize that this technology\u2026 take in Australia's case, is enabling us to provide remote health services to some of the most disadvantaged Australians in our country. I mean, that is amazing. It's tremendous. We want all that, but at the same time companies have a responsibility, like any company does, whether you're online or you're on the high street.JOURNALIST: Were you expecting that the US President would also be involved in this?PRIME MINISTER: I don't manage his diary.JOURNALIST: It was on, on his diary\u2026PRIME MINISTER: Which sessions he's able to attend and he attends, I don't provide a running commentary.JOURNALIST: On the bilat with Boris Johnson, and Hong Kong specifically, what did you discuss? What can the world be doing? What needs to be done before this escalates further?PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the key is all of us working together to seek to de-escalate the situation and where we have opportunities just to do that we will take those opportunities. We urge protestors to be conducting themselves in a peaceful way. And we encourage those who are raising issues to be able to be heard by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to seek to resolve those issues internally. These are internal matters and we would hope that they would be resolved that way. And so many of us who sit around the table were just sitting around have citizens, often dual citizens. That are residents in Hong Kong, I met with Prime Minister Trudeau today and we had a very good discussion. Canada has some 300,000 or thereabouts, of people who hold passports with Canada, we have around 100,000 so we have a shared interest in this, as does the United Kingdom and we have a similar number, with, even more so in Australia. So we're watching this very closely and we're swapping notes. We would like to see this issue de-escalate. But ultimately that's in the hands of those who are coordinating the protests and those who are responding.JOURNALIST: You're never going to have 100 per cent of protesters perfectly behave obviously, would you say overall their actions have been fair enough and valid?PRIME MINISTER: I would just continue to encourage them to express their views peacefully. I would encourage those responsible at a domestic level to be responding to those in an appropriate way.JOURNALIST: Just further on the talks with Boris Johnson on trade. Is there a recognition there's maybe some sensitivity now that the US is also saying they want to do a trade deal as soon as possible, they've got a [inaudible] first likes to be the winner, are we worried about upsetting our other most important relationship?PRIME MINISTER: I don't think these issues cross over. There's a lot to go around, and Australia I think for one will be pretty [inaudible]. What Prime Minister Johnson and I discussed today is there's the 80-20 rule pretty much applies to this. The first 80 per cent of what we'd seek to do is pretty straightforward and I think we can move forward rapidly, I mean we've been setting our own records in being able to strike agreements around the world and so we're pretty match-fit when it comes to these issues. We've been striking a lot of agreements and they're great agreements, some of the best agreements we've seen anywhere in the world. We're very pleased with them. And so we encourage them to do a deal with the United States we encourage them to do a deal with many others. Today and over the course of the last two days. I've continued to prosecute our case for the EU free trade agreement. There are some difficult issues there, the geographic indicators issue is a tough one. But we'll work through that patiently. The EU and the UK are the next two very big agreements that are there on a bilateral basis. But we've also been talking a lot about the RCEP agreement here. This is the agreement that is bringing together a lot of the Indo-Pacific nations. And which brings in some of the big economies of the region. So we think that's exciting. But if anyone is in a room talking about a better trade and freer trade. You'll find Australia in that room. And we're good at that.JOURNALIST: On the election campaign you spoke about how well Jenny Morrison was received. How did she enjoy yesterday and how has she found this G7 experience?PRIME MINISTER: Well look, it's quite a difference for us. I mean. I come from the suburbs in Sydney. And this is a long way from the Shire and, but, you know the reason why people I think respond so well to Jen, and I am you know, ridiculously and passionately biased on this topic. Is she's just a natural wonderful and friendly person and she doesn't care whether you're the first lady of the United States or you know, the lady she'd meet in the street like she did actually on election night when she went up to a lady who was sleeping rough on the streets that night on her way home. That's Jen she's amazing.JOURNALIST: On the FTA with Britain. How quickly after Brexit do you hope to have that done? Boris Johnson said it's impossible to do it any sooner than a year with the US what's the timeframe for you for successfully-PRIME MINISTER: Well I'd like to think we could move quicker than that. But look you just got to get around the table and work it through. So I'm not going to create any arbitrary deadlines on this. I mean I would hope that we could include as I say the 80-20 rule could apply. Let's lock in what we can lock in and get that moving and I think that creates momentum for the UK now for arrangements with Australia and others to be concluded quickly. But you know at the end of the day it's going to be in our interests. We're going to sign up to something that we don't think helps us. And neither will they and that's how this should work. I mean countries come together. Whether it's at a forum like this or to sit around the trade table because they're pursuing their national interests. That's why we're here. There should be no surprise about that. And sometimes those interests don't align.JOURNALIST: But in less than a year you're saying?PRIME MINISTER: Oh I hope so.JOURNALIST: Just quickly, on the online extremism, the plan being discussed talks about big tech companies voluntarily reporting information, did Donald Trump give you any indication that he would urge American big tech companies to take part in this scheme?PRIME MINISTER: The President did a lot of listening today. And the work we have to do is build that system. And that's what we're doing with the OECD. So you know we're not getting ahead of ourselves here. I mean Australia will take its own decisions about this. And where we want to mandate these things. We will. But these rules work best when you can try and engage as many countries as you can. I mean take what we've been able to achieve on multi-national tax avoidance. I mean we've raised billions and billions and billions of dollars. Through a process that began at the G20, worked with the OECD, countries are now sharing information on where these companies pay tax. Which means there's more tax revenue coming into Australia's coffers from big multinationals who frankly should pay their fair share of tax. And we've been able to work with the international system to get a really good result for Australia so that's why I'm optimistic about that. I've seen it work before. But what you do is you're patient about it, you work with people you get the rules right, build the relationships. But I can tell you sitting around that table, we all understand that digital platforms are amazing, but we all understand whether it's your child who gets bullied online or whether it's the most extreme and violent content. These are dangerous things that can happen in that space. And there needs to be better control and more responsibility taken. But my preference is they just do it. That actually take the initiative themselves. Should it really be necessary for the world's biggest economies to come together and actually talk about regulation... wouldn't they want their platforms and their systems to be safe? You know you talk to small business people and they make their products they're very proud of them. They put them on the shelves, they want them to improve people's lives. Now. That's what I want from the digital platforms. I want them to have that attitude and if that means they're going to spend a bit more money to make their product safe well spend it. You can spend enough money making sure that the second you look up a book on the internet and they send you an ad for about seven more. They can crack that technology really fast, so if they can crack that, I'm sure they can work this stuff out too.JOURNALIST: One of President Macron's focuses here has been those fires in the Amazon, has Australia been asked to contribute any money and if not, are you making contingent [inaudible] in case we are?PRIME MINISTER: It's very early days on this. There are two calls totalling around 50 million globally to address that and that should be well within the means of those countries for which is their- this is their primary sphere. I mean Australia has always responded first to issues that have happened specifically in our region. Of course the Boxing Day tsunami. Things like this Australia has been quick out of the blocks. And when we're seeing these issues happening in Indonesia or elsewhere in the Pacific, we are the first responders and Australia takes our responsibility in our sphere very seriously. This is not directly in our sphere but it is the lungs of the world and we understand it's important. So we'll be looking to see as those arrangements come together and the commitments that are made, the UK have already committed $10 million to this process. And I have no doubt that once that call is worked through the G7 sitting around the table here and those who are closer to that scene. Then they will be able to more than accomplish that. In terms of the resource expertise, Australia is a very well positioned to advise on those things but our assets we will obviously need in Australia. We will be coming into an Australian summer. And our assets will need to be here domestically to deal with that. So if it's a question of resources and funds then I have no doubt that they'll, through the cooperation of international partners they'll be able to meet that.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2338564I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXD-2XF1-F0YC-N1K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 27, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Because millions of Australians each day use the Internet, they use social media platforms, they use digital platforms, and I want them to be safe. I know for many that it might seem that when these summits are held, people wonder why people come from so far and they gather together to talk about these issues but I can tell you that when one in five of your jobs are dependent on trade when there are complex issues that are going on with our global economy, whether there are the threats that can reach out and touch the lives of Australians through digital platforms, well, you've got to be. And I appreciate the invitation from President Macron to be here, to be able to participate and put Australia's perspective and contribution on these issues. And we have been making a contribution. I've just come from the session that was dealing with the digital technology issues and I was so encouraged by the tremendous support that we've had, not just for when we went to Osaka with the G20 declaration, but now following that up here and also following it up with the OECD so we are actually putting some tools in place which can assist all countries and we are taking the measures, as Australian journalists will know that we're taking home, to deal with these issues.</p><p>So it has been a good opportunity over the last two days to focus on Australia's national interest and how that fits in with what is happening elsewhere in the world. These are quite unique opportunities. As an Australian Prime Minister, I always prefer to be in Australia dealing with issues on the ground domestically. But these events are necessary and have provided Australia, I think, a good opportunity. Whether it's my first formal meeting with Boris Johnson today, which was both an enjoyable and very lively affair and very useful too. Including also meeting with Prime Minister Modi on the margins of the discussions, as well as Prime Minister Trudeau where we particularly discussed the issues around both of our interests in Hong Kong. And the Prime Minister of Italy, they're going through many changes there. But there was a continuity in the relationships between our economies. I was particularly pleased with Australia's actions on establishing the National Space Agency. The Australian Space Agency in Adelaide has actually been noticed and I'm thrilled about that. And there was a keenness, both in the United Kingdom and from Italy, to engage with us so I have no doubt Premier Marshall, pardon the pun, will be over the moon when it comes to the Space Agency initiatives. And so there has been a lot of opportunity to push some business forward here for Australia and so I'm very appreciative of the opportunity we've had and happy to take any questions.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you encouraged by the apparent detente between the U.S. and China over trade?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well I am. I am encouraged. I am pleased. But I am also mindful that we've been here before. But I'd much rather be in this situation and I'm pleased that China has responded and it's coming back and will then work with the United States. As I said yesterday, the issue is having an obvious impact on the global economy and I'm pleased to see that they're going to try and move things forward. Yesterday we saw Japan and the United States come to an agreement. I'm pleased, having spoken to Prime Minister Abe today, that that arrangement also protects Australia's interests and the arrangements we have with Japan and that's welcome news. We've been having a tremendous relationship with Japan and so I appreciate the fact that as a result of that relationship that we ensure both of their undertakings to Australia can be met at the same time, we have been able the make the undertaking to the United States.</p><p>JOURNALIST: As you say, we've been in this place before. We were in this place just 8 weeks ago. Do you think there is going to be any genuine progress this time?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, you can only hope so. But as President Trump often says, let's just see what happens. And I think that's the situation we are in. But I'm always hopeful that they can come to an [inaudible]. And as I said yesterday, it's the product of our economy going into a new phase globally. China has grown, and that means that the arrangements that we have in trade or whether it's emissions reduction or the global responsibility and the relationships people have, this all changes too. So this is a moment for that to re-gear and let's hope that something can be concluded in the bilateral trading relationship between the US and China.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Next year's the Summit is set to be hosted by the United States, potentially even at Donald Trump's own property. Would you be hoping to score an invite along to the G7 in 2020?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well look, I'm not one who rushes for the plane to attend summits. That's not my style. I'd much prefer to be back working on issues domestically because we've got a lot of issues we've got to focus on domestically. While these events are necessary, my focus is always on Australia's national interest at home. We'll be in Washington next month and this has been another opportunity, I think, to reinforce the wonderful relationship we have with the United States. We have a common view on so many issues and that's because our interests are just so aligned. We are for a free world where people could get on about their lives and America have always championed that and that's why we have such a strong values connection.</p><p>JOURNALIST: From the digital transformation stuff today and encouraging tech companies to voluntarily report extremist content being taken down. Are you happy with the support you're receiving from the United States? Because it looked on post-feed like Donald Trump didn't even turn up to that session?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: No he was... I just came from that session, he was very supportive. And I appreciate all of the country's support here at the G7 for that initiative. Both Prime Minister Modi and I spoke to that matter, it's one of the reasons we were both here. And there is very strong support because look, it's a simple proposition. It actually is really simple. The rules in the digital world have to be the same as the rules in the physical world. What we expect of companies in the physical world you should expect from companies in the digital world. I mean, you don't go and let a company put a dodgy product, a kid's toy, on a shelf and let them buy it and then swallow it and choke to death do you? You don't. You have proper laws that protect people from those sorts of things. Digital companies are no different. They have to take responsibility for what they produce and the services they provide and making sure they don't harm people. And this is just a simple process of ensuring that the digital world's rules reflect the physical world's rules. Not more, not less, just the same. And it's just a product of the world responding to this changing and amazing technology. We also recognize that this technology... take in Australia's case, is enabling us to provide remote health services to some of the most disadvantaged Australians in our country. I mean, that is amazing. It's tremendous. We want all that, but at the same time companies have a responsibility, like any company does, whether you're online or you're on the high street.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Were you expecting that the US President would also be involved in this?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't manage his diary.</p><p>JOURNALIST: It was on, on his diary...</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Which sessions he's able to attend and he attends, I don't provide a running commentary.</p><p>JOURNALIST: On the bilat with Boris Johnson, and Hong Kong specifically, what did you discuss? What can the world be doing? What needs to be done before this escalates further?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the key is all of us working together to seek to de-escalate the situation and where we have opportunities just to do that we will take those opportunities. We urge protestors to be conducting themselves in a peaceful way. And we encourage those who are raising issues to be able to be heard by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to seek to resolve those issues internally. These are internal matters and we would hope that they would be resolved that way. And so many of us who sit around the table were just sitting around have citizens, often dual citizens. That are residents in Hong Kong, I met with Prime Minister Trudeau today and we had a very good discussion. Canada has some 300,000 or thereabouts, of people who hold passports with Canada, we have around 100,000 so we have a shared interest in this, as does the United Kingdom and we have a similar number, with, even more so in Australia. So we're watching this very closely and we're swapping notes. We would like to see this issue de-escalate. But ultimately that's in the hands of those who are coordinating the protests and those who are responding.</p><p>JOURNALIST: You're never going to have 100 per cent of protesters perfectly behave obviously, would you say overall their actions have been fair enough and valid?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: I would just continue to encourage them to express their views peacefully. I would encourage those responsible at a domestic level to be responding to those in an appropriate way.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Just further on the talks with Boris Johnson on trade. Is there a recognition there's maybe some sensitivity now that the US is also saying they want to do a trade deal as soon as possible, they've got a [inaudible] first likes to be the winner, are we worried about upsetting our other most important relationship?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't think these issues cross over. There's a lot to go around, and Australia I think for one will be pretty [inaudible]. What Prime Minister Johnson and I discussed today is there's the 80-20 rule pretty much applies to this. The first 80 per cent of what we'd seek to do is pretty straightforward and I think we can move forward rapidly, I mean we've been setting our own records in being able to strike agreements around the world and so we're pretty match-fit when it comes to these issues. We've been striking a lot of agreements and they're great agreements, some of the best agreements we've seen anywhere in the world. We're very pleased with them. And so we encourage them to do a deal with the United States we encourage them to do a deal with many others. Today and over the course of the last two days. I've continued to prosecute our case for the EU free trade agreement. There are some difficult issues there, the geographic indicators issue is a tough one. But we'll work through that patiently. The EU and the UK are the next two very big agreements that are there on a bilateral basis. But we've also been talking a lot about the RCEP agreement here. This is the agreement that is bringing together a lot of the Indo-Pacific nations. And which brings in some of the big economies of the region. So we think that's exciting. But if anyone is in a room talking about a better trade and freer trade. You'll find Australia in that room. And we're good at that.</p><p>JOURNALIST: On the election campaign you spoke about how well Jenny Morrison was received. How did she enjoy yesterday and how has she found this G7 experience?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well look, it's quite a difference for us. I mean. I come from the suburbs in Sydney. And this is a long way from the Shire and, but, you know the reason why people I think respond so well to Jen, and I am you know, ridiculously and passionately biased on this topic. Is she's just a natural wonderful and friendly person and she doesn't care whether you're the first lady of the United States or you know, the lady she'd meet in the street like she did actually on election night when she went up to a lady who was sleeping rough on the streets that night on her way home. That's Jen she's amazing.</p><p>JOURNALIST: On the FTA with Britain. How quickly after Brexit do you hope to have that done? Boris Johnson said it's impossible to do it any sooner than a year with the US what's the timeframe for you for successfully-</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well I'd like to think we could move quicker than that. But look you just got to get around the table and work it through. So I'm not going to create any arbitrary deadlines on this. I mean I would hope that we could include as I say the 80-20 rule could apply. Let's lock in what we can lock in and get that moving and I think that creates momentum for the UK now for arrangements with Australia and others to be concluded quickly. But you know at the end of the day it's going to be in our interests. We're going to sign up to something that we don't think helps us. And neither will they and that's how this should work. I mean countries come together. Whether it's at a forum like this or to sit around the trade table because they're pursuing their national interests. That's why we're here. There should be no surprise about that. And sometimes those interests don't align.</p><p>JOURNALIST: But in less than a year you're saying?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Oh I hope so.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Just quickly, on the online extremism, the plan being discussed talks about big tech companies voluntarily reporting information, did Donald Trump give you any indication that he would urge American big tech companies to take part in this scheme?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: The President did a lot of listening today. And the work we have to do is build that system. And that's what we're doing with the OECD. So you know we're not getting ahead of ourselves here. I mean Australia will take its own decisions about this. And where we want to mandate these things. We will. But these rules work best when you can try and engage as many countries as you can. I mean take what we've been able to achieve on multi-national tax avoidance. I mean we've raised billions and billions and billions of dollars. Through a process that began at the G20, worked with the OECD, countries are now sharing information on where these companies pay tax. Which means there's more tax revenue coming into Australia's coffers from big multinationals who frankly should pay their fair share of tax. And we've been able to work with the international system to get a really good result for Australia so that's why I'm optimistic about that. I've seen it work before. But what you do is you're patient about it, you work with people you get the rules right, build the relationships. But I can tell you sitting around that table, we all understand that digital platforms are amazing, but we all understand whether it's your child who gets bullied online or whether it's the most extreme and violent content. These are dangerous things that can happen in that space. And there needs to be better control and more responsibility taken. But my preference is they just do it. That actually take the initiative themselves. Should it really be necessary for the world's biggest economies to come together and actually talk about regulation... wouldn't they want their platforms and their systems to be safe? You know you talk to small business people and they make their products they're very proud of them. They put them on the shelves, they want them to improve people's lives. Now. That's what I want from the digital platforms. I want them to have that attitude and if that means they're going to spend a bit more money to make their product safe well spend it. You can spend enough money making sure that the second you look up a book on the internet and they send you an ad for about seven more. They can crack that technology really fast, so if they can crack that, I'm sure they can work this stuff out too.</p><p>JOURNALIST: One of President Macron's focuses here has been those fires in the Amazon, has Australia been asked to contribute any money and if not, are you making contingent [inaudible] in case we are?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: It's very early days on this. There are two calls totalling around 50 million globally to address that and that should be well within the means of those countries for which is their- this is their primary sphere. I mean Australia has always responded first to issues that have happened specifically in our region. Of course the Boxing Day tsunami. Things like this Australia has been quick out of the blocks. And when we're seeing these issues happening in Indonesia or elsewhere in the Pacific, we are the first responders and Australia takes our responsibility in our sphere very seriously. This is not directly in our sphere but it is the lungs of the world and we understand it's important. So we'll be looking to see as those arrangements come together and the commitments that are made, the UK have already committed $10 million to this process. And I have no doubt that once that call is worked through the G7 sitting around the table here and those who are closer to that scene. Then they will be able to more than accomplish that. In terms of the resource expertise, Australia is a very well positioned to advise on those things but our assets we will obviously need in Australia. We will be coming into an Australian summer. And our assets will need to be here domestically to deal with that. So if it's a question of resources and funds then I have no doubt that they'll, through the cooperation of international partners they'll be able to meet that.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister just call on Iran. Are you aware of any fallout following the visit by the Foreign Minister yesterday?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: I'm not, I think people are a bit over-excited on that.</p><p>JOURNALIST: What's your prediction on Brexit. Do you think Boris Johnson can actually deliver Brexit when he says he's going to go?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well I tell you, if you sat in that room with him this morning you'd be absolutely convinced of it. You'd be pretty certain of it. I mean. I very much enjoyed our meeting let me just say that. We are going to have a great relationship. Despite his cricket sledging! Which was very modest I should say, it was modest sledging.</p><p>JOURNALIST: How far away are we from the EU FTA? Is that one a little bit further down the track?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: That one's more complex. I think but the process is started and we'll just keep [inaudible] this is how you get these things done. And it just it's a step by step by step by step. But, I detected, well not just detected, because they stated to me quite plainly, whether it was my meeting with Chancellor Merkel or the Prime Minister of Italy today. I know he's acting Prime Minister at the moment, but there is a real keenness to engage with Australia. See Australia's economy is well respected around the world our expertise is well respected. It's why we were so excited to hear that our actions on the space agency have been picked up and there was a keenness to engage. They also know about the significant procurements we're doing in defence industry and technology. They are very well aware of our expertise in cyber. And it was a good opportunity today to talk about what was happening down in South Australia as part of that centre of excellence of technology hub that they're creating down there. So I'm looking forward to getting on the phone to Steve Marshall. And I've got a few leads for him.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Have you had fun Prime Minister? I mean, you were invited here as an observer and you've really been very involved actually?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well these are good opportunities for Australia, it is the first time Australia has been invited to come and participate in the G7. That's a reflection positively on Australians. And so as a result, of course, I'm going to come. It would be I think disrespectful to our, perhaps our hosts. But also Australians who I think through their own efforts have been able to put Australia's head up. And people are noticing what Australia is doing and they want us to be part of what's happening at this level. It's been a busy few days particularly after a very busy time we had in Viet Nam, so I am looking forward to getting home and focussing on issues there. Josh has given a great speech earlier today our time and he has really set out some of the big productivity challenges that are there which reflect what I set out in Perth a few weeks back. Not long after the election. Productivity I know scares a lot [inaudible] but it's just simply this. It's our plan to ensure that you earn more from what you do. That's what it's about. I think sometimes when people talk about these issues, Australians get a bit worried from past experience. That just means they want to pay me less for what I do, nope it's actually the absolute opposite.

The panelists were Valerie Tan, vice-president Public Relations, Social Media, Internal Communications, Emirates; Brian Lott, head of corporate communications, Mubadala; Paul Holmes, Founder &amp; Chair, The Holmes Report; Faisal Abbas, Editor-in-Chief, Arab News and Sunil John, Founder and CEO, ASDA'A Burson-Marsteller.\u00a0</p><p>At a tipping point</p><p>In his opening note, moderator John warned that the media landscape is at a tipping point due to the rise of fake news and algorithm-driven content creating mechanisms, which create and foster distrust between the public, media, governments and organizations. \"Big tech is not neutral,\" he said. \"Some people are comparing its influence to 'big tobacco'. Do we need regulation to deal with that? That is one of the big questions of the day.\"</p><p>READ: If client servicing were digitized, would you be dealing with a robot? Trust issues</p><p>Between PR and news media, Lott said that the public still believed in media more than PR. However, it isn't easy to pick one or the other as traditional media values are becoming murky, and of course, as Tan pointed out, \"People have always understood that PR and advertising has an agenda.\" What is dangerous is that people now \"realize that news outlets come with an agenda, too,\" she added.</p><p>Worse still is that the threat to traditional media values comes from media itself \u2013 albeit new platforms. \"My question from this region is, why is it you are tolerating terror propaganda on these outlets? The reality is children are being radicalized [and] they are being sent to fight in Syria,\" said Abbas.</p><p>MUST READ: How much in agency fees are P&amp;G and Unilever cutting now?</p><p>But, perhaps the biggest danger comes not from fake news itself but from attacks on legitimate news stories. \"There's a concerted effort to portray legitimate journalism as fake news,\" said Holmes. \"This is a huge problem for the media and for us in PR, undermining the credibility of both.\"</p><p>As Abbas said, \"If you want the truth, read the media; if you want the exposure, work with bloggers and influencers.\"</p><p>Moral responsibility</p><p>Media and PR, both, have massive reach today owing to social media. This reach, ease of access and the rise of fake news, make regulation necessary. But Abbas warns, that censorship and regulation should not be the responsibility of the government, but of the media platform itself. Furthermore, as Holmes pointed out, PR practitioners, too, have \"a moral obligation not to pollute those channels, social and mainstream, with our own fake news\".</p><p>For example, look at the demise of UK-based PR firm Bell Pottinger that went into administration following a much criticized and racially charged campaign in South Africa. John asked whether PR firms had a moral choice to make over which clients they represent. \"Many agencies were involved in so-called 'dark arts and spin' ... two phrases I hate,\" he said.</p><p>READ: There's a nap truck coming to town!</p><p>Holmes said that Lord Bell, the former chairman of Bell Pottinger, had \"a view of PR being untenable in the modern world.\" He added: \"The divide between what is good PR and what is moral and ethical is, today, for the most part invisible. They are congruent in a way they never were 30 years ago. Ethics has to be at the heart of what we want to do. It's possible to do honorable work for bad companies. Equally, it's possible to do dishonorable work for good companies.\"</p><p>At the end of the day, \"People want truth \u2026 they want reality, not unreality. And PR has always communicated that reality in an interesting and compelling way. With advertising being viewed more skeptically, we have an opportunity to take advantage of that,\" said Lott.</p><p>A new face of PR</p><p>PR needs to do some PR for itself, it would seem. In this new world order, it needs to be perceived as a positive force for truth, accuracy and the free and open exchange of ideas in a changing media landscape \u2013 not as an industry of 'spin'.</p><p>As Abbas said, \"We need to agree that perhaps most of the world looks at the PR industry as lobbyists,\" he said. \"You are hired on behalf of [the] client, not the people, and you are paid to do a particular job, and they want value for money.\" Tan, too, agreed that PR was still struggling to change its negative reputation. \"PR has some way to go to convince we are not 'spin doctors'. People know PR comes with an agenda, but it shouldn't be a negative, it's actually very helpful,\" she said.</p><p>And maybe there is hope. As John said, \"In Bell Pottinger's case, [its] downfall came from within \u2013\u00a0[it was] expelled from the industry body PRCA for bringing the industry into disrepute.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/27/151963448441.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/27/151963448441.jpg</url></p><p>In2 Innovation Summit Panel<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMMU-110751397</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMMU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRJ-BDG1-JDJN-62DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MediaQuest Corp.

In their most recent update, PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association showed that US venture investments for the third quarter totaled nearly $28 billion. For the year, it looks like venture investments will top $100 billion, exceeding the previous record by more than $20 billion.</p><p>Early stage investments have grown over the last two years, from a level of around $5 billion per quarter to a level closer to $9 billion per quarter. Investments in even younger companies \u2014 known as angel and seed rounds \u2014 meanwhile, have been fairly steady for the last four years, hovering around $2 billion per quarter.</p><p>This raises a question about the overall structure and dynamism of the economy. We know that over the past several decades, the pace of new business formation has dropped. The ratio of entries versus exits has fallen. The Atlantic even says that \u201cStartups Aren\u2019t Cool Anymore.\u201d\u00a0Many have claimed that the chief reason for the supposed rising concentration of industries is a lack of robust antitrust enforcement.</p><p>No industry has come under heavier fire than Big Tech. Lax antitrust is a convenient villain but far too simplistic for our taste. What if the chief problem isn\u2019t Washington\u2019s antipathy but instead its overzealousness?</p><p>For example, the cost of going or staying public has risen dramatically over the last two decades. Initial public offerings (IPOs) plummeted after the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations were enacted. Mergers and acquisitions soared. Big Tech buyouts became the chief exit strategy for venture-backed firms. But regulatory factors drove consolidation in other industries, as well. For example, the Affordable Care Act dramatically accelerated consolidation in health care, where giant health systems gobbled up hospitals, clinics, and physician practices, first around their states, then their regions, and now nationwide.</p><p>As a result, the number of publicly traded US firms dropped from nearly 8,000 in 1996 to fewer than 4,000 today.</p><p>This consolidation is not only the result of regulatory overreach. Other structural factors are probably also at play. For example, many people thought the plummeting cost of information driven by the internet would boost the number of smaller, independent firms. That\u2019s true in some cases. But it\u2019s also had just the reverse effect for some firms in some industries, where Coasean transaction costs dropped even more inside of firms. So companies like Google, Amazon, and Apple could absorb hundreds of software-based firms and grow into trillion dollar titans.</p><p>Yet the regulatory rationalization of the last two years is healthy, and is sparking the economy in a number of ways. One is the robust growth of venture capital, to record levels. Another is an upturn in IPOs, where activity has been the healthiest since 2014. It will take years to determine whether new policies can substantially alter the structure of the economy, whether we can truly boost entrepreneurial dynamism, or whether slower rates of business entry-exit are here to stay under a new normal of big company capitalism.</p><p>It would be a mistake, however, to launch an antitrust crusade to correct a perceived problem that may actually be the result of overbearing policies that policymakers are already well into the process of fixing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1187858I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWK-NB01-JDG9-Y42R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 7, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This was preceded by Trump threatening to shut down websites that are stifling \"conservative voices\".</p><p>Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey has decided to stick to his guns in this fight stating that -</p><p>\"Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me. Please leave our employees out of this. We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.\"</p><p>In a thread, Dorsey went on to say that this decision does not make Twitter an \"arbiter of truth\" and their intention is \"to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves\".</p><p>Dorsey also shared Twitter's Civic Integrity Policy in the thread that states - \"You may not use Twitter's services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes\".</p><p>For Twitter, civic processes are events or procedures \"mandated, organized, and conducted by the governing and/or electoral body of a country, state, region, district, or municipality to address a matter of common concern through public participation\". For example - political elections, censuses and major referenda and ballot initiatives.</p><p>Twitter fighting it out is a \"dramatic shift\" for the social network. Twitter has been Trump's primary tool to get his \"unfiltered\" messages out to his followers.</p><p>This is Trump's strongest threat against Big Tech yet.</p><p>Big tech companies have been accused of anti-competitive practices and for violating user privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a US congressional panel.</p><p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who is a frequent critic of Big Tech companies, has sent a letter to Dorsey asking why the company should continue to receive legal immunity after \"choosing to editorialise on President Trump's tweets\".</p><p>We'll have to see how this plays out. On a separate note, on Wednesday, three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals in Washington upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit by a conservative group and right-wing YouTube personality against Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple accusing them of conspiring to suppress conservative political views.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The quoted words come from a new report from the Brookings Institution, Big Tech Threats: Making Sense of the Backlash Against Online Platforms[1]. The report compares the response in the United States to that in other countries and suggests that other countries, especially in Europe, have moved much faster to try to rein in the tech giants than has the United States. While the U.S. concern about government regulation of constitutionally protected free speech is a valid one, companies like Facebook, Amazon and Twitter have additional protection. </p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 states clearly the U.S. government's approach to the then-new internet: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' This is the get-out-of-jail-free card that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to play[2] in an interview last year with Kara Swisher of The New York Times: 'It's hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent [of material posted to Facebook].' He goes on to equate making a misstatement with a deliberate lie and reaches the conclusion that Facebook is not going to ban someone 'if they get things wrong, even multiple times.'Because the tech giants are not legally culpable, they have no skin in the game and no reason to police themselves. In other countries, the Brookings report says, there is a 'growing international consensus [that] holds that the ways in which today's dominant online platforms are currently designed poses an inherent threat to democracy. [T]he ways in which dominant platforms filter and spread information online presents a serious political threat not only to newer, more fragile democracies but also to long-standing Western liberal democracies.' These countries, Brookings notes, 'have identified a clearer regulatory role to mitigate the threat online platforms pose to democratic societies.' In the United States, concerns about violating the First Amendment's free speech rights have effectively negated any response to 'classifying certain content as unacceptable.' A second way that other nations have attempted to rein in the tech giants is by implementing strict rules on protecting user data and privacy. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is 'the toughest and most comprehensive digital privacy law on the books and is grounded in a cultural attachment to protecting the right of individuals to control access to their personal information.' In the United States, however, the 'privacy regime largely focuses on protecting individuals from state intrusion and companies from red tape.' The GDPR became effective in May of last year and in its first year levied fines of just \u20ac56 million[3] (about $63 million), most of which (about $56 million) was a single fine against Google. GDPR violations can result in fines as high as 4% of a firm's global revenue. That's serious money, even for Facebook and Google; $63 million is loose change found under the couch cushions. Finally, other countries have taken a much firmer stance against anti-competitive behavior by the tech giants. Since 2017, the European Commission has fined Google more than $9 billion[4] for anti-competitive behavior. The Brookings paper cites a suggestion from a Canadian government report on anti-competitive behavior: '[M]oving competition enforcement in the tech sector 'away from price-centric tools' and toward evaluating the value of data at stake between merging companies.' An EU report goes even further: 'Even where consumer harm cannot be precisely measured, strategies employed by dominant platforms aimed at reducing the competitive pressure they face should be forbidden in the absence of clearly documented consumer welfare gains.' In the United States, Brookings notes, the 'consumer welfare standard [is] exclusively focused on low prices [and] has failed to capture concentration in the tech sector as dominant technology companies have evaded scrutiny by offering their services for free or at a low cost.' Google's domination of search[5], for example, has left the company open to questions of how it generates search results and who benefits from how those results are presented. The Brookings authors, research analyst Clara Hendrickson and senior fellow in governance studies William A. Galston, suggest that the challenges of dealing with the digital information sector may be beyond the ability of a single nation and eventually will require international agreements. There is a caveat, however: '[Such agreements] would have to be restricted to countries that share a broad understanding of the importance of individual liberty and a free civil society. It is not clear, for example, that the People's Republic of China would ever be willing to embrace the kinds of individual and civic rights for information technologies that liberal democracies consider nonnegotiable.' If in the United States, 'libert, galit and fraternit' has focused primarily on the first, in Europe, one could argue, it has focused only on the first two. Achieving 'fraternit' has always been the hard part, and it grows more difficult every day. But, for example, Facebook's shares keep going up, even though nobody trusts the company[6].  24/7 Wall St. 50 Most Valuable Brands in theWorld <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2019/05/16/50-most-valuable-brands-in-the-world-2/\">https://247wallst.com/special-report/2019/05/16/50-most-valuable-brands-in-the-world-2/</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/disclaimer-and-terms-of-use\">https://247wallst.com/disclaimer-and-terms-of-use</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/big-tech-threats-making-sense-of-the-backlash-against-online-platforms/\">https://www.brookings.edu/research/big-tech-threats-making-sense-of-the-backlash-against-online-platforms/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/opinion/nancy-pelosi-facebook-video.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/opinion/nancy-pelosi-facebook-video.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/05/one-year-in-gdpr-fines-havent-hit-publishers-or-very-many-other-companies-actually/\">https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/05/one-year-in-gdpr-fines-havent-hit-publishers-or-very-many-other-companies-actually/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/technology-3/2019/03/20/will-a-1-7-billion-fine-make-google-flinch/\">https://247wallst.com/technology-3/2019/03/20/will-a-1-7-billion-fine-make-google-flinch/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/media/2019/05/13/this-is-how-google-shapes-peoples-attention-to-the-news-2/\">https://247wallst.com/media/2019/05/13/this-is-how-google-shapes-peoples-attention-to-the-news-2/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/media/2019/05/01/why-facebook-share-prices-keep-going-up-even-though-nobody-trusts-the-company/\">https://247wallst.com/media/2019/05/01/why-facebook-share-prices-keep-going-up-even-though-nobody-trusts-the-company/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TFS100006155914714534925176900174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TFS-5001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W72-S8T1-JCMN-Y2NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1119\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>24/7 Wall St.</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 29, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the hangover for the biggest and best-performing technology stocks of the Obama era has yet to fully dissipate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In some ways, that's not too surprising. Trump's election gave new reason to buy banks (higher interest rates and less regulation), steel (infrastructure and possible import tariffs), health care (less scrutiny on drug pricing and health insurance mergers) and a range of other sectors. Money managers had to sell something and tech was a pretty logical choice.</p><p>Not only have managers' portfolios have been overweight in tech, but Trump butted heads during the campaign with Apple (AAPL) over encryption and outsourcing, with Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos over its online retail\u00a0dominance and Washington Post political reporting, and with Facebook (FB) CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>over immigration. To top it off, all three of those stocks had slipped below their 50-day averages before the polls closed on Nov. 8, a technical signal that they were in consolidation mode. Shares of Amazon had tripped up after the e-commerce giant missed earnings estimates and gave a so-so holiday outlook amid\u00a0big spending plans. Facebook\u00a0advised that fourth-quarter revenue growth would slow meaningfully.</p><p>Yet while politics is personal, investing isn't supposed to be, and it usually doesn't take markets long to sort out what matters to corporate bottom lines.\u00a0So does the changing of the guard in the White House really augur a changing of the guard of stock market leadership? Or is this big tech Trump slump just a short-term adjustment to\u00a0a\u00a0changed landscape that won't derail their fundamental earnings power and stock market prowess?</p><h>Time To De-FANG?</h><p>There are opinions on both sides because there's a great deal of uncertainty about what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>will do in office \u2014 especially when it comes to trade.</p><p>DoubleLine Capital co-founder Jeffrey Gundlach, addressing investors\u00a0via a webcast on Tuesday, advised selling the FANGs, reasoning that \"It's not a good idea to bet on things that were correlated to the regimes that have been defeated.\"</p><p>Yet more market strategists and analysts seem to think that a <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>won't diminish the attractiveness of some of the best-loved tech stocks of recent years, though there may be exceptions.</p><p>\"With the benefit of hindsight, the FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)) should have been sold a few weeks ago, but I certainly wouldn't sell them now,\" Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, told IBD.</p><p>\"We would be buying the fear,\"\u00a0Piper Jaffray tech analyst Gene Munster wrote in a Thursday research note, calling the recent declines a \"rare opportunity to buy pullbacks in companies with clear multiyear revenue and earnings trajectories.\"</p><p>Shares of Apple on Monday morning were back to their levels on Nov. 8 after sliding as much as 6%. Apple has retaken a 110.33 buy point on the  but\u00a0remains well off its 2016 peak on Oct. 25, when Apple reported mixed quarterly results and a cautious holiday outlook.</p><p>Netflix shares haven't staged as much of a comeback and remain down 4.6% from their Election Day closes. But shares did find support above their 50-day moving average and are up nearly 3% Monday monring. Netflix was the one FANG stock to have a strong gain after its earnings report, and its shares didn't lose much ground into Election Day.</p><p>In general, markets are expecting a more solid growth foundation at home, aided by tax cuts, infrastructure spending and a more lax regulatory climate, though that will generally be less of a boon to big technology companies which derive a high\u00a0percentage of sales overseas.</p><p>Since Trump's election, the 10-year Treasury yield has spiked by nearly a half percentage point to 2.33%, the highest since December 2015, pricing in\u00a0a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index has hit\u00a013-year highs, gaining vs.\u00a0a basket of developed market currencies.</p><p>The stronger dollar is a modest negative for the earnings of tech companies because profits earned abroad are worth less in dollar terms. Facebook generated 55% of sales outside the U.S. in the latest quarter, while international sales accounted for 62% of Apple's total.</p><h>Trump Trade War With China</h><p>The biggest Trump-related uncertainty hanging over Apple is, of course, the possibility of rising trade tensions with China. Trump pledged during the campaign that his administration would label China a currency manipulator within his first 100 days in office, paving the way for possible tariffs on Chinese imports. China warned after Trump's victory\u00a0via a Communist Party that \"iPhone sales will suffer a setback,\" as will other American products, if he imposes large tariffs on goods made in China, as discussed during the campaign.</p><p>\"Our 'Stay Home' investment strategy might make even more sense than the 'Go Global' alternative given the regime change in Washington,\" Yardeni says.</p><p>Yet\u00a0Yardeni doesn't think Trump will resort to trade wars, settling instead for modest improvement via negotiation and jawboning, of the sort that convinced Ford Motor (F) to keep a production line in Kentucky that was bound for Mexico.</p><p>If Trump's tariffs turn out to be the dog that doesn't bark, then big techs could be net winners from his pro-growth plans.\u00a0That's because Trump campaigned on cutting the tax rate to repatriate profits earned overseas to 10% from 35%. Apple, which has $216 billion in cash held overseas, would be the biggest winner from the change, which CEO Tim Cook has been seeking.</p><p>Other big technology companies with major stores of cash held offshore include Microsoft (MSFT) ($111 billion), Cisco (CSCO) ($60 billion), Oracle (ORCL) ($51 billion) and Google ($50 billion), according to William Blair. The research firm thinks that the repatriated cash could \"spur an increase\u00a0in M&amp;A activity given that many large technology companies are looking for new avenues of growth.\"</p><p>The cash also could be used to boost dividends, buy back shares.</p><h>High-Skill Immigration</h><p>Another\u00a0area of concern about the Trump agenda among technology firms is\u00a0immigration, high-skilled immigration in particular. The tech industry\u00a0would like to see the 85,000 annual cap on H-1B skilled-worker visas, but the worry is that Trump will go the other direction. It's \"possible that Trump's administration could implement fees to make\u00a0these visas more expensive to help protect U.S. workers from displacement \u2014 driving up wages even further for highly skilled\u00a0talent and creating a shortage for specialized workers,\" wrote William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri and colleagues.</p><p>While that could affect the FANGs at the margins, increasing compensation\u00a0or requiring them to do more of their work outside of the U.S., \"IT services companies are likely to be hit the hardest\u00a0(given their heavy reliance on temporary work visas) and business models will ultimately be affected and potentially need to\u00a0change,\" Suri wrote.</p><p>Vishal Sikka, CEO of India-based Infosys (INFY), told Reuters that its margins could be hurt if it can't send low-cost developers on temporary visas to work on U.S. projects. Company founder N.R. Narayana Murthy\u00a0said\u00a0that Infosys may need to cut its on-site teams in half, or less, in the U.S. and rely on more workers in India.</p><h>Three Tech Trends</h><p>While\u00a0Trump's campaign platform on immigration and trade policies would be negative for the U.S. tech sector, \"Trump's election does not change these (three) trends\" that essentially determine the future of technology stocks, said Josh Spencer, manager of the Global Technology Equity Strategy at T. Rowe Price.</p><p>Those three key trends include the growth of cloud computing, disruption of traditional industries due to the internet's increasing pervasiveness, and technologies pushing into new end markets, such as self-driving cars.</p><h>Net Neutrality</h><p>Still, another of Trump's potential policies, a reversal of net neutrality rules that require similar treatment by telecommunications networks of any data transmitted over the internet, could\u00a0shift the balance of power to some degree.</p><p>\"As video becomes an increasingly important growth driver for large-scale internet platforms (Prime Instant Video, YouTube, Facebook Live), the risks posed by a rollback of net neutrality magnify,\" wrote R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. \"Companies under our coverage that would be most impacted by net neutrality changes are Google, Amazon, and Facebook.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a loosening of the rules that let carriers charge extra for \"fast lanes\" would stand to benefit AT&amp;T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA), notes Suri of William Blair.</p><p>However, Trump said during the campaign that he opposed the planned AT&amp;T buy of Time Warner (TWX).</p><p>Still, taking all the potential tech-industry positives and negatives under a <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>together, William Blair still lists\u00a0Facebook among its top picks. Microsoft is another megatech listed as a top pick. Suri clarified to IBD that Amazon remains a top pick for the firm based on sound fundamentals, but its research analysts left the company off their\u00a0list of top performers in the postelection period because of its complicated relationship with Trump.</p><p>RELATED:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-389691</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M6V-C1R1-DYTD-9003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1591\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

A new website, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">SpeakOut.Tech</url>, encourages workers to safely leak information and organize their colleagues and includes a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">video ad</url> that the group is promoting by using the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">micro-targeting</url> ad features of Facebook and Google.</p><p>\"It's really awesome that tech workers are pushing back against their employers,\" said Jelani Drew, campaigner for Fight for the Future. \"People are really fired up.\"</p><p>The campaign comes at a time when Silicon Valley's most powerful firms have faced growing internal backlash and outside scrutiny surrounding the potential damage caused by their technology and their ethically dubious government partnerships.</p><p>Last year, Fight for the Future <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">pushed a campaign against Salesforce</url>, the cloud computing technology firm which has a controversial       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">contract with US Customs and Border Protection</url> (CBP). The law enforcement       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">agency</url> is responsible for implementing Donald Trump's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">anti-immigrant policies</url> and uses Salesforce technology to \"manage border activity\" and \"modernize\" its recruiting process.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">Microsoft</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">Palantir</url> have also faced       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">protests</url> surrounding immigration contracts.</p><p>The disclosures from a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">whistleblower at Cambridge Analytica</url>, a data analytics firm, also launched a scandal surrounding       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">Facebook's privacy practices</url> and use of people's personal information, prompting investigations and regulatory scrutiny across the globe last year. Cambridge Analytica       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">shut down</url> as a result.</p><p>Tech activism further had a dramatic impact last year at Google, where <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">workers successfully organized global walkouts</url> following revelations about the company's $90m payout to an executive       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">accused of sexual misconduct</url>. The movement led to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">some policy changes</url> at the Mountain View company. Google also chose not to renew a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">controversial military contract</url> following worker backlash.</p><p>The new whistleblower campaign provides information about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">SecureDrop</url>, a tool that allows people to send confidential and encrypted tips to the media and other organizations. Fight for the Future is also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">crowdfunding</url> to support advertising for the video, with the goal of reaching workers at the big Silicon Valley firms.</p><p>\"You have the power to speak out. You can do the right thing,\" the video says.</p><p>\"We want to get it in front of as many tech workers and as many people in Silicon Valley as possible,\" said Drew, adding that the message to tech workers was: \"There are people who are 100% behind you ... We can't organize if we don't know what's happening.\"</p><p>                     Send tips to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.speakout.tech/\">Guardian via SecureDrop</url> or contact <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sam.levin@theguardian.com\">sam.levin@theguardian.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-51875351</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFX-M7J1-F021-6087-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

This paradigm is perhaps more real than ever, according to an article by Reuters[4].By exploring the views of Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, the article advises that the deep, multifaceted involvement of big tech companies in consumers' lives, the ultimate dependence that arises from such involvement and the overwhelming vulnerability of such consumers renders tech companies 'too big to fail'. Wylie argues that the vast imbalance of power and information in favour of these companies over users is resulting in a constant scrambling by regulators to control the rapid adoption of such technology forms.The article explores that tech experts point to the positives of technology forms, which on our analysis include the use of 'Robo-Advisers' in the financial sector[5] which have re-created the way financial institutions do business and the recent Cyber Attacks initiated by US Forces[6] we have previously blogged in respect of. </p><p>However, on the other hand, the article stresses the persistent threats posed by various forms of technology on individual privacy. Such forms, when controlled by state actors[7], financially-motivated parties[8], or simply malicious individuals[9], display that whilst consumers need to exercise caution with respect to their technology use and therefore implement sufficient protections, government representatives need to keep on their toes to ensure that such threats are addressed on a regulatory level.

However, while the TikTok ban is an evolution of Trump's ongoing campaign against the company, and likely a ploy to force the sale of the US arm to Microsoft, the ban of WeChat is more unexpected. The world's largest standalone mobile app, WeChat serves as an all-in-one social media, messaging and mobile payments platform, boasting over 1 billion monthly active users. It is the primary social media app in China, but also has users around the world - including in the US. Trump ban: The executive order blocking WeChatThe executive order \"Addressing the Threat Posed by WeChat\" justifies the ban on the basis that the data it collects could be accessed by the Chinese government - although there has been no proof this has happened - and therefore it threatens \"the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States\". Set to come into force on 20 September, it bans \"any transaction that is related to WeChat by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with Tencent Holdings, Shenzhen, China, or any subsidiary of that entity\". The twin WeChat and TikTok bans have prompted outrage from some quarters, with Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, accusing the US of \"creating a double standard\". \"There is no security justification for banning an app merely because it is owned by a Chinese company,\" he said. </p><p>\"Allegations of security risks should be backed by hard evidence, not unsubstantiated innuendo.\" The phrasing of the WeChat ban has also sparked considerable confusion and concern, in no small part because Tencent has made numerous investments in the US tech industry over the past few years. It holds shares in numerous US gaming companies, including Riot Games and Epic Games, as well as content aggregator Reddit and chat platform Discord. The announcement, therefore, was met with initial outrage from the gaming community, although the US government did then confirm that, despite its phrasing, the executive order only impacts transactions related to WeChat, not the wider companies Tencent has holdings in. However, while this may appear to simply be an attempt to ban the WeChat app for users, there are still considerable concerns and questions for many companies that use or are impacted by the app. US tech industry impactOne group that could be particularly hard-hit by the WeChat ban is Silicon Valley companies with Chinese operations. This includes US companies that have set up operations in China, either to reach the local market or make use of the country's manufacturing capabilities - a list that includes Microsoft, Google, Apple and IBM. Apple could be particularly badly hit by this, as it may require the company to delist WeChat from its app stores, including in China. And given that WeChat is the fifth most popular free app on the Chinese app store - just behind TikTok - that could prove to be devastating for a company that in Q1 2020 made 15% of its revenue from the country. It may also significantly affect Chinese companies that opted to move their global headquarters to the US to better access international markets, or set up offices there. This is common practice among Chinese tech startups, and for those that regularly communicate with their Chinese counterparts, WeChat Work - Tencent's answer to Slack - is a commonly used communication and collaboration tool, yet will be effectively banned under the executive order. This could create considerable challenges for productivity, but there are also problems afoot for companies that use WeChat's platforms to promote their products and services. And what workarounds - if any - will be available, remains to be seen. As a result, Mark Tibbs, cyber intelligence director at Mishcon de Reya, believes there is likely to be \"significant backlash\" in response to the ban of transactions relating to both TikTok and WeChat. \"Considering the scale of usage of both apps in the US and globally, these executive orders will undoubtedly cause substantial impacts for both users, communities and in some instances, businesses which rely on the apps to market goods and services, or promote their brands,\" he said. \"The orders may also stimulate the development of various technical workarounds by users to be able to use the apps, and indeed the development of similar apps to fill the niche which will exist. Larger US technology companies will likely see the announcements as an opportunity for future acquisition or launching and promotion of their own alternatives.\" Companies doing business with TencentWhile there has been a clarification that the executive order only relates to WeChat, there is still a considerable grey area here when it comes to defining what does and doesn't relate to the app. If, for example, a company provides services to aid the development of new offices to host WeChat employees, will this be counted by the Trump administration? While the answer may be no, as long as they don't actually use the WeChat app to work with the company, this has not been clarified, and the phrasing of the executive order makes it entirely plausible that this could be deemed unacceptable under the ban. And this isn't a hypothetical example either: US architectural firm NBBJ recently unveiled its designs for Net City, a striking 2 million square metre masterplan in Shenzhen, China, for Tencent, which is designed to host much of its workforce in the city. If the WeChat ban extends to the teams behind the app, this project could be put in jeopardy. A potential backlash in China and beyondAs the ban of TikTok and WeChat are the latest moves in a long-running trade war between the US and China, it would be na\u00efve to think that China will not at least consider retaliating. And that could have dire implications for businesses in the US. \"Another potential reaction to these orders is that of Chinese retaliatory action against US private companies which trade in China or rely heavily on Chinese production in their supply chains,\" said Tibbs. \"As such, we might expect to see similar Chinese action to restrict trade with US entities, particularly those involved in technology.\" This could be particularly damaging to companies such as Apple that rely on Chinese manufacturing for their electronics, doing serious harm to the US economy at a time when it is already is significant jeopardy. However, there are also potential issues in other countries. The user data collected by WeChat and TikTok is extremely similar in scope to that collected by US social media platforms such as Facebook. As a result, it may bring into sharper focus the already growing concerns surrounding privacy and social media. \"Whether or not you believe that Trump is right to ban US companies from transacting with Tencent and Bytedance, this unfolding controversy clearly adds to the uneasiness surrounding social media platforms globally,\" said Danny Bluestone, CEO of Cyber-Duck. \"Twitter and Facebook have proven their inability to curb the spread of misinformation and hate speech and recent ad boycotts from major advertisers send a message from the business community that things need to change. \"With the major US platforms, the problems are there for all to see in the content that is posted and distributed; with the Chinese platforms, there is tension around government regulation and interference. Either way, clear signals from governments to regulate big tech indicate that the value of social media to both users and enterprise partners is diminishing.\" While it may seem unlikely, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that regulators in other countries, sick of trying to reign in data handling by such companies, will use the WeChat ban as precedent to enact similar orders in their own countries. \"American tech companies stand to lose significant global market share if other countries follow a similar standard and block US tech companies from their markets because of concerns about US government surveillance,\" said Castro. There are also potential issues for the UK, which ultimately banned Huawei following US pressure, but may struggle to do the same if the Trump administration raises concerns about WeChat. The UK government has a partnership with Tencent, signed in 2018 to strengthen post-Brexit ties with China. And if Trump continues his efforts, it may once again be forced to make a choice between the two countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-8DD66E4617704908BAD13AABD6FA921D</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NN-C8C1-JC0X-H1D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1437\"/><timeReceived>2:16 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The move, although met with surprise by many, is the latest...</p><p>On Thursday evening, US President Donald Trump signed two executive orders to ban US companies from engaging in business transactions with TikTok parent company ByteDance and Tencent-owned WeChat.   The move, although met with surprise by many, is the latest in the ongoing US-China trade war, which has recently seen TikTok become the next battleground.        However, while the TikTok ban is an evolution of Trump\u2019s ongoing campaign against the company, and likely a ploy to force the sale of the US arm to Microsoft, the ban of WeChat is more unexpected.   The world\u2019s largest standalone mobile app, WeChat serves as an all-in-one social media, messaging and mobile payments platform, boasting over 1 billion monthly active users. It is the primary social media app in China, but also has users around the world \u2013 including in the US.  Trump ban: The executive order blocking WeChat   The executive order \u201c Addressing the Threat Posed by WeChat \u201d justifies the ban on the basis that the data it collects could be accessed by the Chinese government \u2013 although there has been no proof this has happened \u2013 and therefore it threatens \u201cthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States\u201d.    Set to come into force on 20 September, it bans \u201cany transaction that is related to WeChat by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with Tencent Holdings, Shenzhen, China, or any subsidiary of that entity\u201d.      The twin WeChat and TikTok bans have prompted outrage from some quarters, with Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, accusing the US of \u201ccreating a double standard\u201d.   \u201cThere is no security justification for banning an app merely because it is owned by a Chinese company,\u201d he said. \u201cAllegations of security risks should be backed by hard evidence, not unsubstantiated innuendo.\u201d   The phrasing of the WeChat ban has also sparked considerable confusion and concern, in no small part because Tencent has made numerous investments in the US tech industry over the past few years. It holds shares in numerous US gaming companies, including Riot Games and Epic Games, as well as content aggregator Reddit and chat platform Discord.       The announcement, therefore, was met with initial outrage from the gaming community, although the US government did then confirm that, despite its phrasing, the executive order only impacts transactions related to WeChat, not the wider companies Tencent has holdings in.   However, while this may appear to simply be an attempt to ban the WeChat app for users, there are still considerable concerns and questions for many companies that use or are impacted by the app.  US tech industry impact   One group that could be particularly hard-hit by the WeChat ban is Silicon Valley companies with Chinese operations.   The State of Technology This Week  Get the Verdict weekly email     This includes US companies that have set up operations in China, either to reach the local market or make use of the country\u2019s manufacturing capabilities \u2013 a list that includes Microsoft, Google, Apple and IBM.   Apple could be particularly badly hit by this, as it may require the company to delist WeChat from its app stores, including in China. And given that WeChat is the fifth most popular free app on the Chinese app store \u2013 just behind TikTok \u2013 that could prove to be devastating for a company that in Q1 2020 made 15% of its revenue from the country.   It may also significantly affect Chinese companies that opted to move their global headquarters to the US to better access international markets, or set up offices there. This is common practice among Chinese tech startups, and for those that regularly communicate with their Chinese counterparts, WeChat Work \u2013 Tencent\u2019s answer to Slack \u2013 is a commonly used communication and collaboration tool, yet will be effectively banned under the executive order.   This could create considerable challenges for productivity, but there are also problems afoot for companies that use WeChat\u2019s platforms to promote their products and services. And what workarounds \u2013 if any \u2013 will be available, remains to be seen.   As a result, Mark Tibbs, cyber intelligence director at Mishcon de Reya, believes there is likely to be \u201csignificant backlash\u201d in response to the ban of transactions relating to both TikTok and WeChat.   \u201cConsidering the scale of usage of both apps in the US and globally, these executive orders will undoubtedly cause substantial impacts for both users, communities and in some instances, businesses which rely on the apps to market goods and services, or promote their brands,\u201d he said.   \u201cThe orders may also stimulate the development of various technical workarounds by users to be able to use the apps, and indeed the development of similar apps to fill the niche which will exist. Larger US technology companies will likely see the announcements as an opportunity for future acquisition or launching and promotion of their own alternatives.\u201d  Companies doing business with Tencent   While there has been a clarification that the executive order only relates to WeChat, there is still a considerable grey area here when it comes to defining what does and doesn\u2019t relate to the app.   If, for example, a company provides services to aid the development of new offices to host WeChat employees, will this be counted by the Trump administration?   While the answer may be no, as long as they don\u2019t actually use the WeChat app to work with the company, this has not been clarified, and the phrasing of the executive order makes it entirely plausible that this could be deemed unacceptable under the ban.   And this isn\u2019t a hypothetical example either: US architectural firm NBBJ recently unveiled its designs for Net City , a striking 2 million square metre masterplan in Shenzhen, China, for Tencent, which is designed to host much of its workforce in the city. If the WeChat ban extends to the teams behind the app, this project could be put in jeopardy.  A potential backlash in China and beyond   As the ban of TikTok and WeChat are the latest moves in a long-running trade war between the US and China, it would be na\u00efve to think that China will not at least consider retaliating. And that could have dire implications for businesses in the US.   \u201cAnother potential reaction to these orders is that of Chinese retaliatory action against US private companies which trade in China or rely heavily on Chinese production in their supply chains,\u201d said Tibbs.   \u201cAs such, we might expect to see similar Chinese action to restrict trade with US entities, particularly those involved in technology.\u201d   This could be particularly damaging to companies such as Apple that rely on Chinese manufacturing for their electronics, doing serious harm to the US economy at a time when it is already is significant jeopardy.   However, there are also potential issues in other countries. The user data collected by WeChat and TikTok is extremely similar in scope to that collected by US social media platforms such as Facebook. As a result, it may bring into sharper focus the already growing concerns surrounding privacy and social media.   \u201cWhether or not you believe that Trump is right to ban US companies from transacting with Tencent and Bytedance, this unfolding controversy clearly adds to the uneasiness surrounding social media platforms globally,\u201d said Danny Bluestone, CEO of Cyber-Duck.   \u201cTwitter and Facebook have proven their inability to curb the spread of misinformation and hate speech and recent ad boycotts from major advertisers send a message from the business community that things need to change.   \u201cWith the major US platforms, the problems are there for all to see in the content that is posted and distributed; with the Chinese platforms, there is tension around government regulation and interference. Either way, clear signals from governments to regulate big tech indicate that the value of social media to both users and enterprise partners is diminishing.\u201d   While it may seem unlikely, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that regulators in other countries, sick of trying to reign in data handling by such companies, will use the WeChat ban as precedent to enact similar orders in their own countries.   \u201cAmerican tech companies stand to lose significant global market share if other countries follow a similar standard and block US tech companies from their markets because of concerns about US government surveillance,\u201d said Castro.   There are also potential issues for the UK, which ultimately banned Huawei following US pressure, but may struggle to do the same if the Trump administration raises concerns about WeChat.   The UK government has a partnership with Tencent, signed in 2018 to strengthen post-Brexit ties with China. And if Trump continues his efforts, it may once again be forced to make a choice between the two countries.

It was Elizabeth Warren, vocalizing hard numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Massachusetts Democratic senator wove data points into a stump speech that riffed on the policy proposals she's rolled out in her month-old presidential candidacy. \"I love that you want to get into more detail about the 2 percent wealth tax,\" she said to a man asking whether her economic plan would drive the wealthy to move overseas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren's policy-heavy performance last Friday was a hit with her crowd. And that's something she's counting on heavily in her campaign. She has laid down significant markers in a half-dozen different policy areas since the year began, putting pressure on other 2020 presidential contenders while keeping her campaign in the public eye without having to spend a dollar on ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Warren's approach is built on a risky bet: that voters will respond to her detail-driven effort when other Democrats are appealing to hearts as much as their minds and after a 2016 presidential campaign in which Hillary Clinton's policy portfolio wilted in the face of Donald Trump's personal attacks.</p><p>While she's successfully forced some of her rivals to respond to her agenda, particularly her two-part plan last week to curb the growing consolidation of the biggest tech companies, other 2020 hopefuls who have rolled out fewer new policy proposals - California Sen. Kamala Harris and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - are outpacing Warren in early polls and bested her in their initial fundraising hauls after making their first moves for the presidency.</p><p>The contrast between Warren's ambitious agenda-setting and the less wonky paths of other candidates underscores what Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright described as the party's \"diversity of strategy.\" In a crowded field, Democrats don't just have a historically diverse field for 2020 - they are field-testing different theories of connection with voters.</p><p>\"The first thing every candidate should do is allow themselves to be introduced to voters and allow voters to find who they are,\" Seawright said. \"Sometimes people are not moved by policy. Sometimes people are moved by your personal story.\"</p><p>Warren doesn't ignore personal narrative in her pitch, bolstering her universal child care plan by recalling her struggle to secure dependable care for her two children. And neither Harris nor Sen. Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential contender whose rhetoric is imbued with emotion and optimism, scrimps on substance when touting their signature policy proposals.</p><p>But it's clear that Warren is angling to be known as the idea woman in the field.</p><p>She's put out plans for a new tax designed to raise more than $2.5 trillion from the nation's wealthiest 75,000 households, on top of her child care proposal, her bid to rein in big tech companies like Facebook and her commitment to swear off high-dollar fundraisers. Warren leapt into another issue this week, calling for U.S. aviation regulators to follow European counterparts in grounding the Boeing airplane model involved in Sunday's deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash.</p><p>Warren is building a \"policy-first agenda that's about more than just policy\" and making a \"cohesive argument about what is broken in America and how she would fix it,\" said Jesse Lehrich, a longtime Democratic aide who worked on Clinton's 2016 campaign and is not aligned with any 2020 campaign.</p><p>Referring to other 2020 candidates who have offered fewer specifics, Lehrich noted that \"it's less obvious what their answer to that question is: Why me and not someone else?\"</p><p>Clinton's campaign is something of a cautionary tale for Warren. In 2016, Clinton put out piles of white papers, but her general election opponent hardly engaged in the policy debate.</p><p>\"In 2016, we were boxing against Jell-O,\" recalled Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist who also worked on the Clinton campaign. \"Donald Trump would say he agreed with anything or disagreed with anything, without regard to what he believed or what he'd said the day prior.\"</p><p>Ferguson believes things may be different this time around now that Trump has a record in office.</p><p>But in 2020, Ferguson said, Democrats can contrast their plans with \"what he has actually tried to do as president. He can't run away from his own policy agenda anymore because he's actually tried to enact it.\"</p><p>And while Clinton struggled to get some voters to warm to her personally in 2016, polls show none of the Democrats running in 2020 carrying the same high negative ratings.</p><p>Longtime Democratic strategist Jess O'Connell, also a veteran of Clinton's 2016 campaign, lauded Warren for front-loading some of her attention-getting policy ideas before the 2020 primary hits its peak, when Trump is likely to engage more intensely with Democratic candidates and try to knock his potential opponents off course.</p><p>\"Ultimately, everyone is going to have to do both\" policy fluency and personal narrative, O'Connell said, but Warren is \"taking advantage of the news cycle\" to release some of her big ideas early.</p><p>While she's scored early by shaping the Democratic debate on several issues, not all of Warren's forays have taken off. She vowed not to pardon anyone connected to investigations into Trump on the same day the president's former lawyer testified in Congress last month, but the move drew little response from Democratic rivals. She acknowledged even as she swore off high-dollar fundraising that she \"will be outraised by other candidates,\" and the $11 million she already had in the bank before entering the race may not be enough to vault her past Sanders in the battle for progressives' support.</p><p>Warren's evident command of the issues resonated in deep-blue New York City. Nearly a dozen voters said after the Massachusetts senator's event that her intellectual chops were a central part of her appeal to them.</p><p>\"Soaring rhetoric is not what we need now. We need active policy prescriptions,\" said Davin Hatsengate, 44, a New York City resident who attended Warren's Friday event and lauded her recent pledge to treat all her donors equally, regardless of the effect on her campaign's bottom line.</p><p>Emily Price, a 30-something mother of three who also came out to see Warren on Friday, praised Warren for saying more than \"what maybe sounds right and feels good in our hearts.\"</p><p>\"It's one thing to say nice things and make me feel excited, but to have a plan makes me feel ... a lot more secure,\" Price said.</p><p>Still, even one of Warren's strong supporters acknowledged the challenge in her policy-centric approach.</p><p>\"Hard facts are something that most of America doesn't deal with,\" said Madeline Moch, who attended the New York event. \"They like things sort of abbreviated and put into a nutshell. And that's how (Trump) got elected.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Meg Kinnard contributed from South Carolina.

It was Elizabeth Warren, vocalizing hard numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Massachusetts Democratic senator wove data points into a stump speech that riffed on the policy proposals she's rolled out in her month-old presidential candidacy. \"I love that you want to get into more detail about the 2 percent wealth tax,\" she said to a man asking whether her economic plan would drive the wealthy to move overseas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren's policy-heavy performance last Friday was a hit with her crowd. And that's something she's counting on heavily in her campaign. She has laid down significant markers in a half-dozen different policy areas since the year began, putting pressure on other 2020 presidential contenders while keeping her campaign in the public eye without having to spend a dollar on ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Warren's approach is built on a risky bet: that voters will respond to her detail-driven effort when other Democrats are appealing to hearts as much as their minds and after a 2016 presidential campaign in which Hillary Clinton's policy portfolio wilted in the face of Donald Trump's personal attacks.</p><p>While she's successfully forced some of her rivals to respond to her agenda, particularly her two-part plan last week to curb the growing consolidation of the biggest tech companies, other 2020 hopefuls who have rolled out fewer new policy proposals - California Sen. Kamala Harris and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - are outpacing Warren in early polls and bested her in their initial fundraising hauls after making their first moves for the presidency.</p><p>The contrast between Warren's ambitious agenda-setting and the less wonky paths of other candidates underscores what Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright described as the party's \"diversity of strategy.\" In a crowded field, Democrats don't just have a historically diverse field for 2020 - they are field-testing different theories of connection with voters.</p><p>\"The first thing every candidate should do is allow themselves to be introduced to voters and allow voters to find who they are,\" Seawright said. \"Sometimes people are not moved by policy. Sometimes people are moved by your personal story.\"</p><p>Warren doesn't ignore personal narrative in her pitch, bolstering her universal child care plan by recalling her struggle to secure dependable care for her two children. And neither Harris nor Sen. Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential contender whose rhetoric is imbued with emotion and optimism, scrimps on substance when touting their signature policy proposals.</p><p>But it's clear that Warren is angling to be known as the idea woman in the field.</p><p>She's put out plans for a new tax designed to raise more than $2.5 trillion from the nation's wealthiest 75,000 households, on top of her child care proposal, her bid to rein in big tech companies like Facebook and her commitment to swear off high-dollar fundraisers. Warren leapt into another issue this week, calling for U.S. aviation regulators to follow European counterparts in grounding the Boeing airplane model involved in Sunday's deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash.</p><p>Warren is building a \"policy-first agenda that's about more than just policy\" and making a \"cohesive argument about what is broken in America and how she would fix it,\" said Jesse Lehrich, a longtime Democratic aide who worked on Clinton's 2016 campaign and is not aligned with any 2020 campaign.</p><p>Referring to other 2020 candidates who have offered fewer specifics, Lehrich noted that \"it's less obvious what their answer to that question is: Why me and not someone else?\"</p><p>Clinton's campaign is something of a cautionary tale for Warren. In 2016, Clinton put out piles of white papers, but her general election opponent hardly engaged in the policy debate.</p><p>\"In 2016, we were boxing against Jell-O,\" recalled Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist who also worked on the Clinton campaign. \"Donald Trump would say he agreed with anything or disagreed with anything, without regard to what he believed or what he'd said the day prior.\"</p><p>Ferguson believes things may be different this time around now that Trump has a record in office.</p><p>But in 2020, Ferguson said, Democrats can contrast their plans with \"what he has actually tried to do as president. He can't run away from his own policy agenda anymore because he's actually tried to enact it.\"</p><p>And while Clinton struggled to get some voters to warm to her personally in 2016, polls show none of the Democrats running in 2020 carrying the same high negative ratings.</p><p>Longtime Democratic strategist Jess O'Connell, also a veteran of Clinton's 2016 campaign, lauded Warren for front-loading some of her attention-getting policy ideas before the 2020 primary hits its peak, when Trump is likely to engage more intensely with Democratic candidates and try to knock his potential opponents off course.</p><p>\"Ultimately, everyone is going to have to do both\" policy fluency and personal narrative, O'Connell said, but Warren is \"taking advantage of the news cycle\" to release some of her big ideas early.</p><p>While she's scored early by shaping the Democratic debate on several issues, not all of Warren's forays have taken off. She vowed not to pardon anyone connected to investigations into Trump on the same day the president's former lawyer testified in Congress last month, but the move drew little response from Democratic rivals. She acknowledged even as she swore off high-dollar fundraising that she \"will be outraised by other candidates,\" and the $11 million she already had in the bank before entering the race may not be enough to vault her past Sanders in the battle for progressives' support.</p><p>Warren's evident command of the issues resonated in deep-blue New York City. Nearly a dozen voters said after the Massachusetts senator's event that her intellectual chops were a central part of her appeal to them.</p><p>\"Soaring rhetoric is not what we need now. We need active policy prescriptions,\" said Davin Hatsengate, 44, a New York City resident who attended Warren's Friday event and lauded her recent pledge to treat all her donors equally, regardless of the effect on her campaign's bottom line.</p><p>Emily Price, a 30-something mother of three who also came out to see Warren on Friday, praised Warren for saying more than \"what maybe sounds right and feels good in our hearts.\"</p><p>\"It's one thing to say nice things and make me feel excited, but to have a plan makes me feel ... a lot more secure,\" Price said.</p><p>Still, even one of Warren's strong supporters acknowledged the challenge in her policy-centric approach.</p><p>\"Hard facts are something that most of America doesn't deal with,\" said Madeline Moch, who attended the New York event. \"They like things sort of abbreviated and put into a nutshell. And that's how (Trump) got elected.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Meg Kinnard contributed from South Carolina.

It was Elizabeth Warren, vocalizing hard numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Massachusetts Democratic senator wove data points into a stump speech that riffed on the policy proposals she's rolled out in her month-old presidential candidacy. \"I love that you want to get into more detail about the 2 percent wealth tax,\" she said to a man asking whether her economic plan would drive the wealthy to move overseas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren's policy-heavy performance last Friday was a hit with her crowd. And that's something she's counting on heavily in her campaign. She has laid down significant markers in a half-dozen different policy areas since the year began, putting pressure on other 2020 presidential contenders while keeping her campaign in the public eye without having to spend a dollar on ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Warren's approach is built on a risky bet: that voters will respond to her detail-driven effort when other Democrats are appealing to hearts as much as their minds and after a 2016 presidential campaign in which Hillary Clinton's policy portfolio wilted in the face of Donald Trump's personal attacks.</p><p>While she's successfully forced some of her rivals to respond to her agenda, particularly her two-part plan last week to curb the growing consolidation of the biggest tech companies, other 2020 hopefuls who have rolled out fewer new policy proposals - California Sen. Kamala Harris and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - are outpacing Warren in early polls and bested her in their initial fundraising hauls after making their first moves for the presidency.</p><p>The contrast between Warren's ambitious agenda-setting and the less wonky paths of other candidates underscores what Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright described as the party's \"diversity of strategy.\" In a crowded field, Democrats don't just have a historically diverse field for 2020 - they are field-testing different theories of connection with voters.</p><p>\"The first thing every candidate should do is allow themselves to be introduced to voters and allow voters to find who they are,\" Seawright said. \"Sometimes people are not moved by policy. Sometimes people are moved by your personal story.\"</p><p>Warren doesn't ignore personal narrative in her pitch, bolstering her universal child care plan by recalling her struggle to secure dependable care for her two children. And neither Harris nor Sen. Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential contender whose rhetoric is imbued with emotion and optimism, scrimps on substance when touting their signature policy proposals.</p><p>But it's clear that Warren is angling to be known as the idea woman in the field.</p><p>She's put out plans for a new tax designed to raise more than $2.5 trillion from the nation's wealthiest 75,000 households, on top of her child care proposal, her bid to rein in big tech companies like Facebook and her commitment to swear off high-dollar fundraisers. Warren leapt into another issue this week, calling for U.S. aviation regulators to follow European counterparts in grounding the Boeing airplane model involved in Sunday's deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash.</p><p>Warren is building a \"policy-first agenda that's about more than just policy\" and making a \"cohesive argument about what is broken in America and how she would fix it,\" said Jesse Lehrich, a longtime Democratic aide who worked on Clinton's 2016 campaign and is not aligned with any 2020 campaign.</p><p>Referring to other 2020 candidates who have offered fewer specifics, Lehrich noted that \"it's less obvious what their answer to that question is: Why me and not someone else?\"</p><p>Clinton's campaign is something of a cautionary tale for Warren. In 2016, Clinton put out piles of white papers, but her general election opponent hardly engaged in the policy debate.</p><p>\"In 2016, we were boxing against Jell-O,\" recalled Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist who also worked on the Clinton campaign. \"Donald Trump would say he agreed with anything or disagreed with anything, without regard to what he believed or what he'd said the day prior.\"</p><p>Ferguson believes things may be different this time around now that Trump has a record in office.</p><p>But in 2020, Ferguson said, Democrats can contrast their plans with \"what he has actually tried to do as president. He can't run away from his own policy agenda anymore because he's actually tried to enact it.\"</p><p>And while Clinton struggled to get some voters to warm to her personally in 2016, polls show none of the Democrats running in 2020 carrying the same high negative ratings.</p><p>Longtime Democratic strategist Jess O'Connell, also a veteran of Clinton's 2016 campaign, lauded Warren for front-loading some of her attention-getting policy ideas before the 2020 primary hits its peak, when Trump is likely to engage more intensely with Democratic candidates and try to knock his potential opponents off course.</p><p>\"Ultimately, everyone is going to have to do both\" policy fluency and personal narrative, O'Connell said, but Warren is \"taking advantage of the news cycle\" to release some of her big ideas early.</p><p>While she's scored early by shaping the Democratic debate on several issues, not all of Warren's forays have taken off. She vowed not to pardon anyone connected to investigations into Trump on the same day the president's former lawyer testified in Congress last month, but the move drew little response from Democratic rivals. She acknowledged even as she swore off high-dollar fundraising that she \"will be outraised by other candidates,\" and the $11 million she already had in the bank before entering the race may not be enough to vault her past Sanders in the battle for progressives' support.</p><p>Warren's evident command of the issues resonated in deep-blue New York City. Nearly a dozen voters said after the Massachusetts senator's event that her intellectual chops were a central part of her appeal to them.</p><p>\"Soaring rhetoric is not what we need now. We need active policy prescriptions,\" said Davin Hatsengate, 44, a New York City resident who attended Warren's Friday event and lauded her recent pledge to treat all her donors equally, regardless of the effect on her campaign's bottom line.</p><p>Emily Price, a 30-something mother of three who also came out to see Warren on Friday, praised Warren for saying more than \"what maybe sounds right and feels good in our hearts.\"</p><p>\"It's one thing to say nice things and make me feel excited, but to have a plan makes me feel ... a lot more secure,\" Price said.</p><p>Still, even one of Warren's strong supporters acknowledged the challenge in her policy-centric approach.</p><p>\"Hard facts are something that most of America doesn't deal with,\" said Madeline Moch, who attended the New York event. \"They like things sort of abbreviated and put into a nutshell. And that's how (Trump) got elected.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Meg Kinnard contributed from South Carolina.

And we begin with Tim O'Brien in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM O'BRIEN, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sara Lee, famous for its pastries, is now one of the latest corporate giants to abandon Andersen.  So, too, Abbott Laboratories, the healthcare giant.</p><p>Without clients, the demise of one of the premier Big Five accounting firms is only a matter of time.</p><p>And for the clients Andersen leaves behind, securities experts see a crisis in the making.</p><p>JACK COFFEE, COLUMBIA UNIV. LAW SCHOOL: The problem for 2,000- odd American corporations is, they all now know that the other members of the Big Four do not have the capacity overnight to pick up all the Arthur Andersen clients.</p><p>O'BRIEN: Andersen says it has no plans to file for bankruptcy, but leaders of the accounting profession say, they're getting ready.</p><p>BARY MELANCON, AMERICAN INST. OF CPAS: I have been in contact with the leaders of the 20 largest firms, and they're all committed to do what's necessary to make sure that the profession meets its obligations with a minimal amount of disruption.</p><p>O'BRIEN: The Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to relax the rules, allowing Andersen clients who want out to file unaudited financial statements, as long as the audited reports are submitted within 60 days.</p><p>HARVEY PITT, SEC CHAIRMAN: The commission is going to take every step that is necessary to make sure that investors in our capital markets have the critical information they require.</p><p>O'BRIEN: It isn't only the corporate clients who are bailing. The General Services Administration, landlord and superstore for the federal government, has also suspended Andersen from any new contracts with the United States.</p><p>Existing agreements, worth some $60 to $90 million, will still be honored.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>O'BRIEN: Lawyers for Andersen told MONEYLINE tonight they will try to get this case to trial swiftly under the federal Speedy Trial Act.  That means within 70 days.</p><p>The lawyers may be asking themselves if their client will still be around in 70 days -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Tim, this indictment against Andersen has the effect of being really a judgment against Andersen.</p><p>The federal government, the Department of Justice in this case because of the impact it has on Andersen, really serving as not only prosecutor, but judge and jury as well.  Is that not correct?</p><p>O'BRIEN: It is correct.  The fact, it may never go to trial. There may not be a company around.</p><p>The government wants to use this high profile case to make a point, that obstruction of justice will not be tolerated.</p><p>Criminologists will tell you, if you want punishment to be a deterrent, make it swift and make it certain, make it severe.</p><p>The question that is left, however, is, is it fair?</p><p>DOBBS: Any indication that the Justice Department in its enthusiasm for prosecution is going to bring an indictment anyway soon against the source of all of these problems?  That is Enron, its management, its executives?</p><p>O'BRIEN: They're not saying anything about that.  They are saying it's a live case.  And there still may be other indictments, including those who either shredded documents or directed others to do so.</p><p>Enron -- they're not saying anything right now.</p><p>DOBBS: OK.  Tim, thank you very much.  Tim O'Brien.</p><p>Andersen indictment, of course, is grabbing headlines.  But when it comes to corporations and crime, there are plenty of precedents of companies who have tangled with the law.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some corporate crimes are easy to see.  An Exxon tanker spills oil off the Alaska coast, and the oil company ultimately pays a $125 million fine.</p><p>In the 1980s, crimes by junk bond king Michael Milken bring down Drexel Burnham Lambert.</p><p>Charles Keating of Lincoln Savings becomes the poster boy for dozens of S&amp;L crooks who cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>In the 1990s, multinational pharmaceutical companies, including Hoffman-Laroche and BASF, conspire to fix prices for vitamins. Hoffman-Laroche alone is fined $500 million.</p><p>By contrast, if Andersen is found guilty of obstruction of justice, it faces a possible fine of only a half-million dollars.</p><p>RICHARD SYLLA, NYU ECONOMICS HISTORIAN: The amount of the fine isn't really what's important.  It's, you know, how -- how much reputation do you lose?  Do people trust you any more?</p><p>FRANK: But for some giant companies like General Electric, regulators from one agency or another are always looking for possible violations.</p><p>GE, for instance, was found guilty of criminal price fixing in the 1960s.  More recently, it has faced civil sanctions for polluting the Hudson River.</p><p>RUSSELL MOKHIBER, CORPORATE CRIME REPORTER: These fines have very little deterrent effect.  The deterrent effect is the publicity, the publicity by major media outlets that report on these crimes and that shame these companies and these executives into doing the right thing.</p><p>So it's not -- it's not the prosecution per se.  It's the publicity.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK: The corporate crime reporters list of the top 100 fines paid by companies over the last decade shows that environmental violations are the most common crimes.</p><p>Anti-trust and price fixing conspiracies are next, followed by plots to defraud various government agencies -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Allan, thank you very much.</p><p>The Justice Department targeted the entire firm of Andersen. Essentially, the Justice Department indicted 85,000 people for the actions of what appear to be fewer than two dozen.</p><p>But there is a realization that their future is increasingly uncertain.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers has the story from Chicago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What was once the prestige firm in accounting is on the verge of collapse.</p><p>It's a long way down for the 89-year-old Andersen, named after its founder Arthur Andersen, and built on a reputation for high standards.</p><p>ALLAN KOLTIN, PRACTICE DEV. INST.: Some say they were like the Marines.  Some say they were the elite. Some even said that they were a bit brash.  Andersen's the best of the best -- just ask them.  And they'll tell you.  But they were.</p><p>RODGERS: Massive layoffs could begin as early as next week, if the steady exodus of clients continues.</p><p>In Chicago, 5,300 jobs are at stake.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am just getting prepared, just in case, if we do go down.</p><p>RODGERS: Andersen has asked its 85,000 employees worldwide to continue working as normal.  But that may be nearly impossible amid the uncertainty.</p><p>Inquiries are pouring into Accountix, a company that provides staffing for large accounting firms.</p><p>Some are from senior Andersen people, others from the top 25 accounting firms eager to snap them up.</p><p>RICHARD CORRADO, ACCOUNTIX: A week ago, I would say it's a trickle.  As of yesterday afternoon, I would say the floodgates opened up, in terms of looking like a mass exodus from the company.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RODGERS: As senior partners are already leaving, some said to be walking away from six- and seven-figure investments in the Andersen partnership.</p><p>That may be too -- not so big a price to pay, though, if the alternative is staying at Andersen and giving up the opportunity to start over at one of the remaining Big Five accounting firms -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Ceci, what is the feeling amongst those Andersen employees with whom you spoke?  How do they feel today after the firm has been indicted?</p><p>RODGERS: They really feel that an injustice has been done.</p><p>Almost to a person, the employees that we've spoken to -- and many of them refuse to go on camera.  The company keeps putting out memos not to talk to the press.</p><p>But they were very forthcoming about -- they're blaming the government.  They're not blaming the senior Andersen partners, not even the ones who did the shredding in Houston.</p><p>They really feel that the government is to blame for indicting the entire company, rather than the few.</p><p>DOBBS: Ceci, thank you very much.  Ceci Rodgers from Chicago.</p><p>Well, turning now to Oracle, its shares fell 6 percent today. That after Oracle reported a 13 percent decline in earnings, a decline in revenue as well for the fourth straight quarter.</p><p>Oracle also is now warning that its earnings will continue to fall short of expectations.</p><p>It now appears that Oracle may have learned a lesson, that it is better to predict less, and when doing so, to aim somewhat lower.</p><p>Bruce Francis reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In ancient Greece, the curious went to an oracle for answers.</p><p>In Silicon Valley, what investors have been getting from Oracle the software giant is apologies.</p><p>Oracle has struggled to predict the pace of the downturn and the recovery.  And now, CEO Larry Ellison says, he's learned his lesson.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, ORACLE CORP.: We're out of the prediction business.  We're not going to predict when it's going to get better.</p><p>We're going to assume it doesn't get any better, and we'll tell you it's going to get better after it's already happened.</p><p>FRANCIS: In the past 12 months, Oracle has warned no fewer than six times, an average of once every 60 days.  That compares to just three times for Microsoft, and once for IBM -- Oracle's two biggest rivals in the database software market.</p><p>CHUCK PHILLIPS, MORGAN STANLEY: And one of Oracle's issues has been, they perennially set targets too high, and they don't meet them.</p><p>So even if they come in in line with what other software companies are doing, the expectations were so high, the stock underperformed.</p><p>FRANCIS: Even though investors always want to know more about the companies they invest in, analysts say that, when it comes to Oracle, fewer predictions from the company, and perhaps fewer misses, too, is a good idea.</p><p>IAN MORTON, JP MORGAN CHASE: I think it's a safer strategy for Oracle to be adopting a much more conservative stance these days.</p><p>One of the probably issues with the Oracle stock has been, it had been a cloud hanging over the company, and the fact that they had been given -- they had given what was probably far overly aggressive expectations.  And I think they set the bar at a much more reasonable level right now.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: Reasonable or not, Oracle estimates and their results are not likely to improve until capital spending on technology picks up in the U.S. And history suggests that that improvement happens after the economic recovery is well under way -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Oracle has really given over these past months some really confusing signals here.</p><p>And Ellison saying last night that he's learned a lesson, it seems like that lesson would have been somewhat clear last fall at the very latest.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's certainly been better at making software than they have about predicting how corporate -- corporations would buy it.</p><p>In fact, it's interesting.  Microsoft has always been accused of lowering estimates so much \u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: \u2026 or talking us down so much, only so that they could overcome those.</p><p>Maybe Larry Ellison could learn a lesson from his chief rival, Bill Gates.</p><p>DOBBS: I'm sure one other thing he would like to have is the cash flow of Microsoft, as well.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think that's true.</p><p>DOBBS: Makes all of that education so palatable. Bruce, thanks.</p><p>Still ahead here, Mideast peace envoy Anthony Zinni meeting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</p><p>The President's envoy says there is hope. That story is coming right up.</p><p>Thinking the unthinkable -- corporate America taking a very hard look at what would happen in another national emergency.</p><p>And spring may be less than a week away, but you wouldn't know it in certain parts of the Midwest.  We'll have that story for you, and its potential impact on the economy in just a few moments.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: A quick follow-up to an angry president.  A management shakeup today at the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Four of its top executives have been replaced, reassigned.</p><p>The shakeup follows an incident this week when a Florida flight school received letters approving student visas for two of the September 11th hijackers.</p><p>That incident embarrassed the agency, raised a firestorm of criticism, and angered President Bush.</p><p>The letters were received six months to the day after those two hijackers flew jetliners into the World Trade Center towers.</p><p>Signs tonight that Israel and the Palestinians may be taking a step back from the brink of war.  Israeli tanks rumbled out of three West Bank towns.</p><p>U.S. envoy Anthony Zinni emerged from talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.  But the President's envoy said he believes now that Arabs and Israelis are committed to ending the bloodshed.</p><p>But violence, nonetheless, continued.  Nine Palestinians were killed, including a woman and her four children.</p><p>So far this month, more than 180 Palestinians have been killed in the violence.  That's three times the number of Israeli deaths.</p><p>Vice President Dick Cheney dropped in on U.S. troops aboard the USS John C. Stennis in the Arabian Sea today.  The Vice President is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the Afghanistan war theater since the U.S.-led campaign against terror began.</p><p>The Vice President told the sailors aboard the Stennis, his stop aboard that aircraft carrier is the highlight of his worldwide and whirlwind Middle East tour.</p><p>The Vice President also watched several fighter jets roar off the deck of the Stennis, and Vice President Cheney also toured the vessel's control center, and he had lunch with the troops.</p><p>The President received his own show of military might today at Fort Bragg, North Carolina -- home of the U.S. special forces.</p><p>The president watched Army Rangers storm a simulated embassy under assault.  The President said it drove home the capabilities of the military and the war against terror demands an increase in defense spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is the largest defense increase in a generation -- because we're at war.</p><p>And Congress needs to pass this budget.  And by the way, it includes another pay raise for people that wear the uniform \u2026</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And another airport evacuation today -- this time Denver's International Airport.  That after a metal detector lost power.</p><p>That caused airport officials to halt all flights out of one of the airport's three terminals.</p><p>Airport officials say it is unclear what caused the power outage. Flights returned to normal just about two hours later.</p><p>And at Orlando International Airport, all eyes are upon some security systems of the future. The prototype security systems are equipped with x-ray vision that can see beneath a passenger's clothing.</p><p>Another machine blows quick bursts of air at a person, then sniffs for traces of explosives.  It can be used, as well, to detect drugs.</p><p>Some civil liberties groups are saying these standards are too intrusive.  The test machines are being supervised by National Safe Skies. It's a non-profit organization.</p><p>President Bush has his plans for a shadow government in the event of a terrorist attack.  Now the CEOs of some of the country's largest companies have a contingency plan of their own.</p><p>Steve Young has the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Called CEO Link, the new emergency network would enable key chief executives to work with one another and the government, despite the likely harm to communications that would follow a terrorist attack.</p><p>Participating CEOs include the chief executives of Bethlehem Steel, General Motors, Federal Express, and the rest of the business roundtable's 150-member chief executives.</p><p>AT&amp;T is taking the lead in designing a system that will include a phone network and a secure Web site.</p><p>MICHAEL ARMSTRONG, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, AT&amp;T: The network that we will establish, first of all, must alert each of us wherever we are in the world.  And it'll be set up to accomplish that, whether we do that over wires, or we do that over wireless, or over any other means -- could be satellite.</p><p>We will accomplish an alert that they must then come into the system, or respond to the system immediately.</p><p>YOUNG: To be sure that only the 150 chief executives can get on to CEO Link, the system will authenticate the number of the calling device, then a pin code, and the caller's voice.</p><p>It would enable counterparts and competitors to see the post- terrorist situation and help stabilize it.</p><p>Last September, Lockheed, for example, provided a C-130 aircraft so Environmental Protection Agency staffers could fly to New York when the Air Force couldn't quickly supply a plane.</p><p>AT&amp;T's CEO thinks the federal government could offer corporate tax credits for anti-terrorism research and development.</p><p>PETE SEPP, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION: Tax credits are never the ideal way of making policy.  But they're infinitely preferable to direct government subsidies or contracts, which could stifle the very innovation we need for the war on terror.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: The Taxpayers Union says, even though this is the 150 biggest U.S. corporations working together, that shouldn't set off anti-trust alarm bells at the Department of Justice.</p><p>And, if there's any doubt, Congress could monitor CEO Link or grant it an anti-trust exemption -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Steve, thank you -- Steve Young.</p><p>Well, still ahead, the race for this year's Oscars is almost over.  But there's talk of a last-minute smear campaign against the movie, \"A Beautiful Mind\" -- one of the favorites, apparently, of the Academy.</p><p>We'll have a lot for you on that story.</p><p>The Federal Reserve meets next week to talk about interest rates. We'll ask our roundtable whether the Fed is preparing the ground for a rate increase.</p><p>And tonight in our segment, \"In Their Own Words,\" a tribute to America's oldest military academy from today's Secretary of Defense.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: There's a lot going on in Hollywood these days.</p><p>\"ET,\" the movie, coming back to the big screen. Russell Crowe could snare another Oscar.</p><p>Peter Bart, the editor-in-chief of \"Variety,\" joins us.  He even has some thought tonight about what appears to be a smear campaign against the movie, \"A Beautiful Mind.\"</p><p>What in the world is going on out there?</p><p>PETER BART, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, VARIETY: God, it sounds like the Olympics, doesn't it.  I mean, things are getting tough.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I mean, why a smear campaign against a movie?  I -- and who's doing it? And why?</p><p>BART: Well, of course, no one really knows.</p><p>You know, every year the competitive level of the Academy Awards gets a little more intense, just like every other aspect of our society.</p><p>And, sure, there are innuendos about what Nash may really have been like -- John Nash, the real character on whom the picture was based.</p><p>My other question is, who cares?</p><p>Because I think the, you know the 4,000 members of the Academy are all, like myself, up there in age.  And I think that everyone's a bit crusty, and been doing this a long time.  I don't think they're influenced by rumors and innuendos.</p><p>DOBBS: You don't think so.  So, we -- who's going to win the category?  You tell me.</p><p>BART: You know, I think \u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Does \"Beautiful Mind\" make it?</p><p>BART: \u2026 I think it's going to be so close, that what could happen is that two favorites could cancel each other out.  Like \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Beautiful Mind\" and, as with the producer scale, all of a sudden, a \"Moulin Rouge\" or a \"Gosford Park\" or an \"In the Bedroom\" wins.</p><p>And this is going to be a year of surprises.  And there's a lot of money at stake.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the money that's at stake, as you say, is sizable. It is huge, in fact.</p><p>Money also at stake in the release of \"ET\" returning to the big screen.  What do you expect to happen there?  Is it going to be a smash again?</p><p>BART: Well, that's a wonderful long shot.  I mean, this is a picture from the Reagan era, really.</p><p>And there have been digital enhancements.  But still, the picture is a little old-fashioned.  It's being introduced with this huge live orchestra of 200, you know, tomorrow night in Los Angeles.</p><p>You know, it could either be \"The Godfather,\" which came out after 25 years \u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BART: \u2026 and no one went to see it because it was on television over and over again.</p><p>Or it could be like \"The Exorcist,\" which became $100 million picture all over again.</p><p>And it's fascinating to take a picture from another generation, you know, and try it out again.</p><p>They're spending money on it.  About 2,000 screens, big campaign. We'll see.</p><p>DOBBS: Ted Koppel, Dave Letterman -- both of whom are beaten nightly by Jay Leno.  Dave stays at CBS.  Ted beats him the rest of the week.</p><p>What's going on, and should we care?</p><p>BART: Well, it was the most written about non-event, wasn't it, because Dave stayed put.</p><p>I think the main thing Dave wanted was, he was going off on vacation and wanted people to pay attention to him.  And he got, you know, a lot of attention.  And then \u2026</p><p>DOBBS: He wasn't interested in that $30 million?</p><p>BART: Well, 31.5 -- I mean, that's a decent wage for a guy, you know.  Ted Koppel \u2026</p><p>DOBBS: You can get by.</p><p>BART: \u2026 Ted Koppel could return on the show.  A lot of people would like (UNINTELLIGIBLE) I'm sure -- PBS.</p><p>You know, if someone would contribute $7.5 million of his $8 million salary, PBS would love him, don't you think?</p><p>DOBBS: I would think that almost anyone would love it if somebody would contribute $7.5 million, including Ted Koppel.</p><p>Bill Maher, in the middle of all of this, \"Politically Incorrect\" cut.  No fanfare for him.  No gnashing of teeth.  What's going on there?</p><p>BART: It's funny, you know, because three or four million people every night listen to him.</p><p>You talk about promotions, you know, Dave Letterman always complained the show wasn't promoted.</p><p>No one ever promoted Bill Maher's show.  And I thought \"Politically Incorrect\" really occupied an interesting niche.</p><p>That probably won't turn up anywhere, you know, at least on network, because some of the advertisers, again, some of the affiliates were getting dicey.</p><p>That -- I'd love to see that in an hour form on cable, perhaps. Don't you?</p><p>DOBBS: I -- it'd be interesting.  Bill has a unique perspective on the world.  And there seems to be plenty of room for unique perspectives on cable and broadcast, for that matter, these days.  So \u2026</p><p>BART: I agree.</p><p>DOBBS: \u2026 we'll see how talent wills out.</p><p>Peter Bart, as always, good to have you with us.  Have a great weekend.</p><p>BART: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, one of Wall Street's best-known, top analysts says the advertising slump is over.</p><p>Chris Dixon of UBS Warburg says the advertising recession has bottomed.  A recovery will be with us much sooner than is expected.</p><p>And Chris is with us tonight.  Tell us exactly what's going on. You really believe this is -- it's over.</p><p>CHRIS DIXON, ANALYST, UBS WARBURG: I think it's happened.  Lee Westerfield, who does our broadcasting work, every week has been has been monitoring very carefully advertising spending.</p><p>And what we've seen this week for the first time is eight of the top 10 categories are up.  And that compares, for example, with in January we only had one category that was up.  In fact, we're up about 17 percent.</p><p>So we think this is really affirming a lot of the whispers that have been going on around advertising land.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIXON: \u2026 here, and it's turning.</p><p>DOBBS: It's been described by media companies and advertising agencies as not an advertising recession, but depression.</p><p>How much do you expect it to come back, and how soon?</p><p>DIXON: Well, what we're saying now is, the advertising for the year will be up about two percent versus a previous decline of about one percent.</p><p>But more importantly, Lou, what we're seeing is continued improvement in individual categories.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>DIXON: Auto spend is up almost 18 percent in the up -- in the spot market.</p><p>Now, the big indicator is going to be, not only the current NCAA ratings that we're seeing on CBS -- we've got the Oscars, as Peter just alluded to.</p><p>But what happens in the upfront market?  We think the upfront market's going to be pretty good.  We see it up -- being up about four percent.  And a lot of that driven by autos.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you're the media savant.  What does this mean for the big media companies?</p><p>DIXON: Well, what it means is, we're going to see the E-side -- the earnings -- beginning to improve in the second half of the year. And that means that companies like AOL, companies like Viacom, are going to continue to be able to start to post accelerating cash flow.</p><p>The past year has been really tough.  But these guys have used the opportunity to tighten their belts.</p><p>And as we take a look and see a turn in the economy, and now in advertising, it's going to come through first to the company's earnings, their cash flow, and eventually their stock prices.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, some of these companies have been beaten down so badly, including AOL Time Warner, as we say, the parent of this network, \u2026</p><p>DIXON: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: \u2026 that down is starting to look like up.</p><p>How significant is it, for example, for AOL Time Warner?  For Disney?  For Viacom?</p><p>DIXON: Well, Viacom, or Clear Channel, which are the first two \u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>DIXON: \u2026 companies we see moving -- of almost 80 cents of every dollar of new dollars of advertising will flow to the bottom line.</p><p>DOBBS: Now, that's for Clear Channel and \u2026</p><p>DIXON: For Viacom specifically.</p><p>DOBBS: \u2026 Viacom, as well.</p><p>DIXON: At AOL we estimate it to about 35 cents, and at Disney to about 25 cents.  So this is a significant \u2026</p><p>DOBBS: What's wrong with the AOL management?  Shouldn't they be getting a little more leverage there?</p><p>DIXON: Has to do with a mix of businesses.  At this point, we've got -- AOL is not in the radio business.  AOL is obviously in the Internet the business, which has been a laggard.  But clearly the cable television business, as well as things like WB.  And of course --</p><p>DOBBS: How about radio?</p><p>DIXON: Radio is the first one to move. It tends to be easy to get into.  Advertising companies come in and say, gee we can start a radio campaign and run with it.  It's much easier and doesn't cost as much.  That's the first place that advertisers tend to commit dollars.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, now that you believe that you have seen a significant turn, there are obviously a lot of other influences on the valuation of these stocks.  How soon would you advise investors to start looking at them?</p><p>DIXON: Well, we have been saying for the past three months is the opportunity would be to pick them off as they're volatile, that is buy them on weakness.  Now we're saying that we think the stocks have defined the trading range, and we're a buyer at these levels.  So whether AOL has been trading between a low of 23 to 29, right now we would be adding the positions in AOL.  Viacom between 37, touched 50 today.  Fine.  We don't think it's going back to 37, we're a buyer.</p><p>DOBBS: Aggressively or just tepidly?</p><p>DIXON: I think what we are saying is this is a firming trend. We do have to get through the next two months.  But, clearly, we seem to see the light at the end of the tunnel and it's not an oncoming train.</p><p>DOBBS: Still caution.  Is that what I hear in your voice?</p><p>DIXON: Cautious optimism.</p><p>DOBBS: There you go.  All right, Chris.  Thanks very much. Chris Dixon, as always, good to have you here.</p><p>DIXON: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up next, more good economic news today, just days before the fed meets to talk about the direction of interest rates. Our round table will be here to tell us whether a rate hike is in the cards, and precisely what will happen to this economy and these markets.</p><p>Also, department stores struggling to raise their sales, despite an improving economy.  They are struggling period.  We'll tell you what their doing to save themselves from demise.</p><p>And just as you were thinking about spring, a winter storm. We'll tell you all about it.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: The world's leading oil producers today decided to leave oil production unchanged, at least until the end of June.  That OPEC decision made in Vienna where they're meeting.  It also raised fears that gasoline prices, however, will be moving higher.  Charles Hodson reports for us from Vienna -- Charles.</p><p>CHARLES HODSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Lou.  Yes, it was very much the decision that everyone including the markets were expecting.  And in -- certainly in terms of OPEC itself, this was a no-brainer.  The 21.7 million barrels as day that the oil cartel has been producing for the first quarter this year, that will continue to be what they produce in the second quarter, as well.  And they are calling on Norway, Oman, Mexico and Russia, among non-OPEC members to help them out with that.</p><p>But let's just have a look at in whose name they're doing this, and this is in the name of price stability.  OPEC's target for crude oil, which is their own basket of oil, which is usually $2 or so cheaper than Brent crude or the New York crude.  They want to see it in the $22 to $28 range, with an average of $25.  Now it's not until, according to the hawks anyway, until we reach $28 a barrel for OPEC crude that OPEC will think again about turning the taps a little wider and giving the economy slightly cheaper oil.</p><p>We could look at oil going all the way up to $30 a barrel, at least in the view of the OPEC talks, before we get a shift in the production levels.  Of course, there are a lot of uncertainties down the track.  We're looking at uncertainties about Iraq, what the military situation will bring there.  Whether that will bring any disruption to supply, whether a broader Middle East crisis could also disrupt supply, whether Russia, for example, will play its part in delivering the production cut backs and a lot of people in the markets are pretty skeptical about that one.  And above all, how quickly the recovery continues from here.  Because obviously, it's a fairly fledgling, a fairly sickly recovery, than cheap oil is going to be very bad for it.  So there are a lot of imponderables, OPEC is not planning to meet for another three-and-a-half months.  And really the ministers could come under a lot of pressure, not least from Washington before then -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Charles, thank you very much.  Charles Hodson live from Vienna.</p><p>Fears of higher oil prices, not the only thing raising some concerns that the fed may have to adjust rates.  There was some -- more positive news today on the economy and those reports adding to the belief among some policymakers may start preparing for a rate hike when they meet next week.  Kathleen Hayes with the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATHLEEN HAYS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Signs of economic recovery have turned from a trickle to a flood.  In February the first back to back monthly gains of industrial production in a year-and-a- half as inventory rebuilding boosts orders and output.  And in mid- March, a substantial jump in consumer sentiment.</p><p>This turn in the economy has coincided with a sharp move higher in bond yields, as traders bet on an eventual move by the Federal Reserve to hike its key short-term interest rate.  And now corporate giants like GE have come to market selling billions of dollars of bond, hoping to issue their debt before rising rates make borrowing more expensive.  But some economists say there's no need to rush.</p><p>STEVE EAST, FRIEDMAN BILLINGS, RAMSEY: I think the long rates as the year progresses, the bond market will see that inflation in fact is going down and not up.  And that long rates, say, the middle of the summer will be at lower levels than we see now.</p><p>HAYS: Chain producer prices in February underscored how weak inflation forces remains in many parts of the U.S. economy, as firms find it tough to raise prices in a weak global economy.  And That global weakness, along with the dollar's high level are expected to hurt exports, which may keep growth and manufacturing slow and the Federal Reserve in check.</p><p>DAVID HUETHER, NATL. ASSN. OF MANUFACTURERS: If we look at the recessions, every recession dating back to 1945, typically, the manufacturing sector expands by about 6 percent during the first six months after a recession.  And we're expecting growth of about a third of that amount.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAYS: At next week's policy meeting, the fed is expected to shift its policy stance is expected to shift to neutral, away from a bias to cut rates.  But most economists are not look for a rate hike until May or June at the earliest -- Lou.</p><p>Kathleen, thank you very much.  On Wall Street, today stocks finished the week on a positive note.  Today's economic report suggesting the economy doing very well, thank you.  Blue chips up five of the past six sessions and up five weeks in a row.  The Dow Jones Industrials gaining 90 points.  The Nasdaq up 14 points.  The S&amp;P 500 rose just over 13 points.  A mixed performance for the week.  The Dow is up for a fifth straight week.  The Nasdaq down more than 3 percent this week, the S&amp;P 500 up slightly.</p><p>For more now on the markets I'm joined by Ron Hill.  Ron, good to have you here.</p><p>RON HILL, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN: Nice to be here, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: We're seeing a split market here, what does that suggest to us?</p><p>HILL: Well, I think people are still highly uncertain.  A lot of people that I have spoken to have put on bull market portfolios after September 21.  And so they're unhappy.  People who put on bear market portfolios are unhappy too, because nothing has moved enough to make either one exactly right.  They are kind of frozen.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you tell us, who's right?</p><p>HILL: Well, we believe the fed with all those rate cuts is going to eventually have all that liquidity come into the stock market, that tends to lift everything; better economy, better profits, better stock prices.  That is sort of the mantra right now, I think, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: We're 14 months after the first of the many of the most aggressive rate cutting year in the history of the fed.</p><p>HILL: Exactly.</p><p>DOBBS: Where is it?</p><p>HILL: It's all sitting in money market mutual funds. It's out there in cash.  And I think people have no real conviction to get back in the market yet.  Perhaps you need to see stronger price action to pull some people in off the sidelines.</p><p>DOBBS: Would you advise people to jump in?</p><p>HILL: We are telling people.  I have just been traveling a lot telling clients, we think you should get in ahead of this.</p><p>DOBBS: Are they listening?</p><p>HILL: A lot of them are still waiting.  They'd like to this break out.  They'd like to see a big volume break out.  We just haven't seen it yet.</p><p>DOBBS: And what sector seems strongest to you?</p><p>HILL: We think it's going to be a cyclical-led recovery, so it's going to be information technology, industrials, sort of the hard goods side of consumer discretionary.  That's where we are encouraging people to put money right now.</p><p>DOBBS: Still some very high multiples in IT, in technology.</p><p>HILL: It is true.  But you know, we have had the first move in technology, now we're having a pullback. Normally what happens is the second move is when the earnings revisions start to run ahead of the market.  That's what we're looking for now.</p><p>DOBBS: Ron, thank you very much.  I'm going to, if I may, introduce some few folks who are going to join you.  Ron, thanks for staying.  Chris Dixon, kind enough to stay with us to participate in this roundtable.  It's called other things, but we won't -- Greg Clarkin, covering the Nasdaq all day, Christine Romans, covering the Big Board, Jan Hopkins, covering the world, and Kathleen Hays back with us.</p><p>How likely is it that we will see anything of substance out of the Fed next week?</p><p>HAYS: I think what the Fed is going to do is shift this policy stance.  But this is so important, because when the Fed worries about the economy in its policy statement, it says our next move, if anything, is to cut rates.  Now it's going to clearly signal, don't worry about rate cuts anymore, we're in neutral.  But people I think are going to look very closely what it says about the economy, they get a sense of how worried is the Fed or how strong\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Whether to listen to Ron Hill.</p><p>HAYS: Exactly.  Because the Fed is kind of cautious.  They figured the rate hikes are pushed off in the year.  If they are really optimistic on the economy, they say, oh my goodness, maybe the rate cuts are coming sooner than we think.  I mean, rate increases are coming sooner than we think.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's hope not.</p><p>JAN HOPKINS, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: But you know, it's interesting, if the Fed is talking about the economy doing well, that could help the markets, because no one thinks that the Fed is going to raise rates right away.  It could encourage all of these investors that Ron's been talking to to put money in the market, and then push things higher.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: But they are starting to put money in the market, because this week we saw the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) data that shows that indeed doubled the inflows into equity funds this week from the week earlier.  Five weeks up for the Dow, three weeks in a row up for the S&amp;P.  We haven't seen that in a long time.  People are cautious, but they're starting to test the waters.</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: You know, technology speaking, it's this whole other issue, IT spending.  And despite the fact that you are getting good macroeconomic news, you still have this disconnect with IT spending.  A lot of folks believe that's going to be a long time coming before that rebounds.</p><p>DOBBS: You are talking about IT as an investment -- an attractive investment target.  Against that, why?</p><p>HILL: Well, we think that, you know, there's going to be another semiconductor cycle that these -- technology is predicted to have profits grower faster than any other segment for this year, up about 50 percent.  If that comes through, I think these stocks will run for a while, and then they'll take a pause later.  But right now, we think it should be semiconductors, equipment makers, the bottom of the food chain, and see if everything else follows along.</p><p>DIXON: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) 2 to 3 percent.  But that's really all about corporate confidence.  What's interesting is, when we looked at advertising, when we looked at how companies are going to be spending with its IT, it's about building corporate confidence.  What we have seen in the market is consumer confidence.  The next step is to really see how companies feel about themselves, are they going to start to spend.  And if they start to do that, then we can really have a sustainable (UNINTELLIGIBLE).</p><p>DOBBS: Well, that corporate confidence comes, does it not, from the same point as investor confidence -- earnings?  Real earnings, not cash flow, not the suggestion that we're going to see a little bump, but real final demand working its way in and creating earnings.</p><p>HAYS: Absolutely.  And I think you're so smart to point that out, because we're going to get good economic numbers.</p><p>DOBBS: I think you're smart.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HAYS: But first quarter gross domestic product, people are talking 4 percent, 5 percent, even 6 percent.  But if you have that swing in inventory, that's great, but if doesn't translate into the earnings, I think the stock market, you know, Ron, you don't get any further down the road than you have gotten between the bulls and the bears then.</p><p>HOPKINS: You know, it's interesting.  Corporate CEOs I think have been burned by making predictions that turned out to be wrong. And so now they're going to be behind the curve.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOPKINS: So now they are going to be behind the curve.  They're going to really have to see the earnings before they start investing in information technologies.</p><p>DOBBS: So we should actually\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: Well, this is why so many people are starting to talk about dividends again, companies that pay dividends.  You know, you're getting back to some basics in the market and what a lot of guys and women on Wall Street are recommending in terms of stocks to buy, because there is still that question about the validity of corporate earnings here. People are still scared.</p><p>CLARKIN: Let me to go back Oracle, which Lou points out -- very smart of you to point out.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: I think you and Kathleen are the smartest people here.</p><p>CLARKIN: Exactly what tech investors are worrying about, what Oracle said, is that big customers, potential customers are still pushing out orders.  You are still not seeing that order flow yet, and that's exactly what's hanging over a lot of these big tech companies.</p><p>HILL: I think what you're going to see that, you know, first quarter profits are going to be down less than fourth quarter profits. You have got a trend where profits are getting less and less negative; positive I think in Q2.  Let's watch the earnings sort of warnings season, which starts officially today, goes for the next two weeks. And I think, you know, we're going to see fewer, you know, preannouncements, and probably more upside surprises than downside surprises in quarter reports.</p><p>DIXON: It's going to be lumpy.  I mean, there's still going to be a couple of disappointments.  People are going to miss some of the numbers.  But that's really the opportunity now.  And volatility, if you are a bull and you see a turn coming, it's really the opportunity that you want to use to your advantage.</p><p>DOBBS: What about the year ago comps in terms of earnings?  Just impossible for this quarter -- let's think to the second, is that what you're suggesting?</p><p>HILL: Exactly.  I think down 13 percent on operating earnings year over year, maybe plus three.  It's the second half of the year when you have got big double-digit gains against very easy comparisons, and that's going to really I think -- people should buy ahead of that, historically, and I think they will.</p><p>DOBBS: Next week, the most important elements?  Obviously, the Fed meeting.  Anything else of importance that our viewers should be looking for?</p><p>HOPKINS: I think that we should be looking at whether there are going to be Andersen effects, companies that can't get their audit reports on time because of all of the problems with Andersen.  We haven't seen that yet, but we could see it.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, apparently, very few people have been reading them very diligently, anyways.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HAYS: But don't you think it's going to be fun to see this H- P/Compaq vote?  I mean, (UNINTELLIGIBLE), but it's a great, great Wall Street story, whether Carly wins or Walter wins.</p><p>DOBBS: And of course, we are reporting tonight, but our sources tell us that talks between Andersen and KPMG are progressing in far more substantively.  We just want to say thank you very much to Chris Dixon, to Ron Hill, Greg, Christine, Jan, Kathleen, as always, everybody have a great weekend.  Thank you.</p><p>Still ahead here, I'll be working.  And when I continue working, we'll be telling you about some department stores who are in real trouble, but coming up with new strategies for survival.  We'll tell you all about that in just a moment.  And celebrating West Point's 200th anniversary.  This is a celebration we can all take part in. And we'll tell you what today's defense secretary said about America's oldest academy.  That's coming up in \"Their Words.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Tough times in retailing, just the latest blow to this country's struggling department stores.  After pursuing a strategy of consolidation and growth, the big stores are under increasing pressure to reinvigorate and reconnect with shoppers.  Peter Viles has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If you could look at the bright side, none of the big department stores is in bankruptcy, none hurting as bad as the Gap.  But that said, the pain continues for this American institution.  And it is partly self- inflicted.  A decade of consolidation and cost cutting has done nothing to excite consumers who are choosing the convenience of discounters.</p><p>HOWARD DAVIDOWITZ, CHAIRMAN, DAVIDOWITZ &amp; ASSOCIATES: Young people are totally turned off by department stores.  Department stores historically have been the home of brands in America, but they're the same brands.  It's Liz Claiborne, Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan.  So you can't tell the difference of what department store you're even in.</p><p>VILES: It shows up in the stocks.  Over the past five years, shares of Federated gained just 17 percent, May department stores just 12.  Saks shares lost 32 percent.  But look at the discounters.  Wal- Mart and Target both up more than 300 percent.</p><p>(on camera): So, department stores are trying to reconnect with consumers.  Bloomingdale's, which is already considered to be one of the best at that, is negotiating to open a smaller store, maybe even a boutique here in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood.</p><p>Other innovations strategies: Neiman Marcus invested in two brands that it sells, Kate Spade handbags and Laura Mercier cosmetics. And May is betting on brides, purchasing three bridal chains.</p><p>DANA TELSEY, BEAR STEARNS: The key is you need better customer service, you need fresher looking stores and some differentiated merchandise.</p><p>VILES: For all their troubles, department stores still rack up massive sales.  Federated outsells Amazon.com five to one.</p><p>DAVID MOIN, WOMEN'S WEAR DAILY: I still think it's viable because there's a ton of business being conducted at department stores.  You have Federated, $18 billion in sales; May company, about $14 billion; Dillard's approaching $10 billion.  People are still there.  The problem is the stores are not making a lot of money.</p><p>Department stores have a trump card, though, and they play it once a year in the fourth quarter.  When Americans are in a hurry, they often go back to the big old stores they have always known.</p><p>Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: \"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\" begins in just a few minutes, coming up at the top of the hour.  For a preview now, let's go to Andrea Koppel in Washington filling in tonight for Wolf -- Andrea.</p><p>ANDREA KOPPEL, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>Coming up, the fate of U.S. Navy pilot Michael Speicher (ph).  He was the first American lost in the Gulf War and 11 years later, he is the only American still unaccounted for.  We'll look at what the Pentagon says about what happened to him and what his friends and family say.  That's just ahead on THE WAR ROOM -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Andrea, looking forward to it.  Thank you very much.</p><p>Well, with less than a week left of winter, there is no sign of spring for most of the Midwest today.  One of the season's biggest snowstorms blanketing much of the plains states, up to two feet of snow covered parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa.  And Northwest, the major carrier at the Minneapolis airport, had to cancel 300 of its flights as the storm moved in dropping all of that snow.  And that winter weather helped lead to an increase in wheat prices on the Chicago Board of Trade.  That amid peers that winter wheat crops may well be damaged.</p><p>Coming up next, in their own words, what top newsmakers said today, including words of praise from a very modern defense secretary for a very old, venerable institution.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Tonight, comments from the day's events and those newsmakers who were contributing. Ranging from the fate of the North Korea defectors to a family's sacrifice in the war against terrorism, and a tribute to West Point.  All from the newsmakers of the day \"In Their Words.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROLIO GOLEZ, PHILIPPINES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The 25 North Koreans are going to be allowed to stay here for a maximum of three days.  After which, they will be going to South Korea.  This has been arranged already.  It's OK with the president, with the department of foreign affairs, the vice president, the secretary of foreign affairs and everything has been arranged already.</p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH: Mr. President, I fear that the judiciary committee was not as fair as Judge Pickering's record.  I'm greatly disappointed and profoundly concerned for our country.  What is now occurring is far beyond the mere tug of war of politics that unfortunately surrounds the Senate judicial confirmation or has surrounded it since Robert Bork.</p><p>SEN. HARRY REID (D), NEVADA: I'm terribly concerned, however, that some people, even some colleagues, are making this committee vote over one person into an unfortunately acrimonious fight.  It's not the vote of people of good will in the confirmation of a judge, but the voices of anger and disappointment that will hurt our institution.</p><p>BUSH: I had the honor of meeting with the widows of two of the soldiers who died.  They, too, and their dad and their mom of one of the guys.  To a person, they said, Mr. President, you know, don't falter. These people just lost a loved one and they are just as resolved about winning this war on terror as I am.  And I was very impressed by their steadfast support for what we're doing and their understanding of the sacrifices necessary to defend freedom.</p><p>RUMSFELD: For two centuries, the long gray line has marched into the history books, heroic in war and vigilant in peace.  Over the decades, graduates of West Point have become leaders in literally every walk of life.  And today, many of those leaders are active in the global war against terrorism, men and women serving in far-flung places across the globe. We respect their service to our country and we thank them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: Indeed, we do.  That is MONEYLINE for this Friday evening.  Thanks for being with us.  I'm Lou Dobbs.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANNOUNCER: This is LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE for Friday, May 31. Here now Lou Dobbs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, HOST: Tonight, preparing for the worst. Americans are warned to get out of India as the threat of war with Pakistan grows.  We'll assess the risk to more than a billion people in the region. Dennis Kux, an expert on the region, will be here to tell us what, if anything, can be done to avoid war.</p><p>And in the Middle East tonight, Israeli tanks have rolled into the West Bank.  The raids come as diplomats step up efforts to end the violence.  I'll be talking with former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>Conflicts around the globe hurt the markets at home.  A rally fades despite good economic news.  We'll wrap up the month with our Wall Street panel.</p><p>And Bill Nygren, the top fund manager of the year, is my guest tonight.</p><p>And they were once considered the Rolls Royce of motorbikes, Indian.  Tonight, the rebirth of an American classic, as more of us hit the road on motorcycles.</p><p>Good evening.</p><p>The United States is preparing for the worst in Asia.  The government is urging all 60,000 American citizens in India to leave. That as Pakistan and India are edging close to war.</p><p>The White House has called for restraint from both sides.  U.S. intelligence officials now estimate 12-million people could be killed in a nuclear exchange.</p><p>Kitty Pilgrim reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): All the world is asking the odds.  How likely is it that India and Pakistan will go to war?  And, if so, will the conflict go nuclear?</p><p>DAVID ALBRIGHT, INSTITUTE FOR SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY: I think the current situation is probably the most dangerous that I've seen.  Pakistan feels empowered by its nuclear weapons.</p><p>I mean, for -- it hasn't brought a stable deterrence to the region, and I think it's made -- the nuclear weapons have made Pakistan more belligerent rather than toning down its belligerence.</p><p>PILGRIM: India is thought to have between 100 and 150 nuclear warheads, Pakistan between 25 and 50.  The problem is telling whether a nuclear weapon has been fired.</p><p>ANDREW WINNER, INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN POLICY ANALYSIS: We've had reports that the Indians are going to put conventional warheads on some of their intermediate-range missiles.</p><p>If one of those missiles were to strike Pakistan, it's not clear that Pakistan would know immediately whether it was a nuclear strike or a conventional strike, and they would have to assume the worst and then perhaps retaliate with their nuclear missiles instead.</p><p>PILGRIM: A recent study found nine- to 12-million deaths could result from a nuclear strike.  However, a look at a map tells the story.</p><p>All of Pakistan's major cities are within a range of a nuclear strike, including Islamabad and Lahore with five-and-a-half million people.  In the port of Karachi, 10 million.  In India, New Delhi alone, there are twelve-and-a-half million people.</p><p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning to Americans saying tensions have risen to serious levels, and the risk of intensified military hostilities between India and Pakistan cannot be ruled out.  There are some 60,000 Americans in India.</p><p>Britain has urged its 20,000 nationalists to leave.  Germany, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada have also issued warnings to their citizens in India.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PILGRIM: India has a no-first-use policy, saying it will not initiate a nuclear attack unless it is responding to one.  Pakistan does not have a no-first-use policy.  Pakistan's position is that it is so overwhelmed by Indian conventional forces, it will use full force, and that includes nuclear force, if it needs to.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you, Kitty.</p><p>President Bush has ordered Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to Asia to try to defuse the tension.  So far, Secretary of Defense Colin Powell has not been sent.</p><p>For more on the story, I'm joined by senior Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre.</p><p>Jamie.</p><p>JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld will head to both countries after he attends a NATO meeting next week.  Of course, he'll be following Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage who's going this week.</p><p>This seems to be part of a strategy by the administration to simply keep both countries engaged, keep them talking because, as long as they're talking and discussing the situation, then there's not going to be a movement toward war.</p><p>The U.S. also seems to be deliberately leaving its troops, both in Pakistan and in India, as a sort of deterrent as well.  The idea is that both sides would be less -- more reluctant to have a nuclear exchange if it would mean killing U.S. troops and thus involving the United States directly.</p><p>But, again, the strategy seems to be to just keep them talking and to keep underscoring the fact that a nuclear exchange really should not be an option here.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Jamie, what can the defense secretary do that his diplomatic counterparts have not?</p><p>MCINTYRE: Well, it's not clear except to continue the dialogue. Now the United States does enjoy better relations with Pakistan and India now than they have in recent years.</p><p>Pakistan, of course, having been a partner in the war against terrorism and in the campaign in Afghanistan.  A lot of support there. And the U.S.-India military relations have also improved significantly in recent years.</p><p>So, while the two sides aren't talking to each other, they will be talking to Secretary Rumsfeld, and he'll simply try to keep the dialogue going.</p><p>DOBBS: And, Jamie, any signs with the world's best intelligence and surveillance in that building -- any sign of any backing down on the part of either side?</p><p>MCINTYRE: We haven't seen it yet.  They're continuing to monitor the situation very closely.  The latest movement we've seen is indications from Pakistan that they are finally moving some of those troops from the North down to the South, although Pakistan says it's still maintaining enough troops to patrol the border near Afghanistan where the hunt for al Qaeda and Taliban continues.  But no signs that anybody has stepped back from the brink at this point.</p><p>DOBBS: Jamie McIntyre, thank you.</p><p>Encouraging reports on the economy not enough to sustain a solid rally on Wall Street today.  The Dow up more than 130 points before reversing course, closing up 13 points.  The NASDAQ finished at session lows, down 16 points. The S&amp;P 500 gained just a little over 2 points.  We'll have complete market coverage later in the broadcast. Jan Hopkins will be here.</p><p>And the promise by some Wall Street firms to clean up their acts isn't stopping investigations underway now by state regulators.  In fact, those state agencies are being inspired by the $100-million settlement paid by Merrill Lynch.  State regulators are collecting hundreds of thousands of documents, and they're gearing up to take on Wall Street.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nearly 40 states are now joining forces to take on Wall Street.</p><p>DEMETRIOS BOUTRIS, CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS COMMISSIONER: There are 10 to 13 states in lead roles, and there are approximately 12 -- a dozen firms that are being looked at very closely.</p><p>FRANK: Investigators are spread from coast to coast with New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer leading the way and now focusing on Morgan Stanley and SalomonSmith Barney.</p><p>Spitzer's squad and other investigators are concentrating on e- mails as well as other evidence which could prove conflicts of interest existed, especially firms which once boasted of their multi- million dollar high-tech analysts.</p><p>Investigators are looking at how pay for analysts is determined. Among the documents being examined, so-called bonus memos, the end-of- the-year self-evaluations analysts often prepare.</p><p>BRADLEY SKOLNIK, INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES COMMISSION: The logical area of inquiry would be any material that would have been generated by brokers that would have indicated investment-banking business that they may have helped the firm win.</p><p>FRANK: Morgan Stanley says it does not use bonus memos when determining compensation, adding, quote, \"We are in the process of reviewing and producing documents requested by the New York State attorney general.  Based on what we've seen thus far, we are comforted rather than concerned.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK: The Securities and Exchange Commission also has 10 active investigations of analyst conflicts underway, and, according to a letter from the SEC chairman that was made public today by Congressman Ed Markey, thus far, only five have been classified as formal investigations.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Allan, thank you very much.</p><p>Andersen today continued to wrap up its defense of the government's obstruction of justice charges.  Peter Viles reporting on the case.</p><p>And, Pete, tell us what you'll have for us tonight.</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, a very strong day for the defense, and it ended on a dramatic note just about 10 minutes ago. David Duncan's assistant was on the stand.  She broke down in tears when she told the story of how he was fired and said he told her nobody did anything wrong, that he didn't do anything wrong. Dramatic testimony.  Very helpful testimony for the defense.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Pete, thank you very much.</p><p>Peter Viles will have the full report for us from Houston coming up in the broadcast.</p><p>Now, for tonight's MONEYLINE quick vote. The question tonight: Do you think we're winning the war against terrorism? Let us hear from you.  Again, the question: Do you think we are winning the war against terrorism?  Cast your vote at cnn.com/moneyline. cnn.com/moneyline. We'll have the results for you later in the broadcast.</p><p>Another terrorist airline attack is unlikely.  It is time to ease up on airport security.  That assessment today from Donald Carty, who is the chief executive officer of American Airlines.</p><p>Carty told a group of business officials in Japan that the current level of security has made the likelihood of another airplane attack very low, but it has also made it very difficult for people to fly, and that's costing the airlines a lot of money.</p><p>American's parent company AMR lost $575 million in the first three months of this year.</p><p>Still ahead, nuclear war between India and Pakistan.  Former Ambassador Dennis Kux from the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars will be here to tell us if war between the two nuclear powers can be avoided.</p><p>Israeli troops have launched another raid into a West Bank city. Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives us his assessment of the situation.</p><p>And they're back.  Indian motorcycles selling as fast as they can be made.</p><p>We'll have that story, a lot more.  All of it coming up next. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: The United States and other countries are now telling their citizens to leave India as soon as possible.  Westerners have been told to leave Pakistan.  The danger, of course, a war between the two countries, one that could escalate into a nuclear conflict.</p><p>Joining me is former Ambassador Dennis Kux.  He is senior policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars.  His assignments included tours in both India and Pakistan.</p><p>Ambassador, good to have you with us.</p><p>AMB. DENNIS KUX, WOODROW WILSON CENTER FOR SCHOLARS: Well, happy to be here, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: This situation seemingly worsens each day.  What makes this time so much different?  These two countries have engaged in brinksmanship before.</p><p>KUX: Well, I think the thing that's very different is that they both have nuclear weapons.  That's why in 1999 when the Pakistanis moved into India's part of Kashmir, Bill Clinton spent the Fourth of July trying to talk the Pakistanis into pulling back, and, once more, you have that type of a situation -- well, even worse -- because, at that time, they were only fussing in one -- fighting in one part of Kashmir.</p><p>Now you've got a million men lined up along the borders, and they've been there for a number of months, and that's what the concern is.</p><p>DOBBS: Vajpayee has said -- the prime minister of India -- that they simply are not going to put up with any more what they see as Pakistan-sponsored terrorism period, and he has said that it is time for a decisive battle, a decisive fight.  Do you believe him?</p><p>KUX: Yes and no. The first part, yes.  And, indeed, George Bush -- President George Bush has said pretty much the same thing because what happened was, in January, President Musharraf said that Pakistan would put the lid on sending terrorists, guerrillas, freedom fighters, whatever you want to call it into India's part of Kashmir.</p><p>He did for a while put the lid on.  But then, in the last couple of months, the lid's come off, and the infiltration has continued. That's what Bush -- that's what -- excuse me -- Vajpayee says they won't accept any more of.  Whether there's going to be a decisive battle -- I think he's using political rhetoric, and that's an unfortunate thing.</p><p>And in both India and Pakistan, there's been a lot of political rhetoric, a lot of sort of nationalist hype, and that has stirred things up.</p><p>And it is, indeed, dangerous because while -- if India retaliates against Pakistan, they'll say they're just retaliating locally, it's only to hit the terrorist camps, it's only to hit the infiltration routes.</p><p>But you could get a counter move by Pakistan and then another move by India, and, the next thing you know, you're up the ladder, and you've got a war, and that's what happened in 1965 when the two countries went to war.</p><p>The only difference -- and it's a big, big difference -- between then and now is then they had only conventional arms. Today, they have nuclear weapons.</p><p>Then, Lyndon Johnson said, \"Let the U.N. handle it.\" Today, George Bush is sending his deputy secretary of state out there in a day or two, the secretary of defense next week.  He's on the phone himself.  Colin Powell is on the phone.</p><p>We're very worried and I think with good reason.</p><p>DOBBS: India has been all but ignored by the most recent administrations, both Clinton, the previous Bush administration, the Reagan administration.  Do we have the kind of relationship, Ambassador, in which we can be influential in de-escalating tensions in -- between the two countries?</p><p>KUX: Well, you have to amend your statement.  It was ignored in a -- by Reagan.  It was ignored by Bush one largely.  It was ignored by Clinton up until his second term, and there was big effort made to improve relations with India.</p><p>They took a down spin when India tested its nuclear weapons, but then starting in -- after their test, we started the dialogue with India.  We took India's side, in effect, in the cargo business in 1999\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Mr. Ambassador\u2026</p><p>KUX: \u2026 and Clinton went out there and had a really successful visit.  And President Bush, George Bush\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: I'm sorry.  Mr. Ambassador, I didn't mean to inject a partisan discussion on the matter.</p><p>KUX: No, I -- no, the present administration has continued what Clinton began.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes.</p><p>KUX: And so, in fact, our relations with India now, particularly since 9/11 when India joined the war against terrorism, are probably as good as they've been at any time since John F. Kennedy was the president.  So, in effect -- it's a long answer to a short question -- we do have influence with India.</p><p>DOBBS: And adequate influence to avoid war?</p><p>KUX: I think they want to avoid war.  What they want is for Pakistan to stop sending these infiltrators across the line of control.</p><p>DOBBS: In your judgment, will there be war?</p><p>KUX: No, I don't think there will be because I think we -- Pakistan knows if there's a war, it would be very hard, I think, to keep it below the nuclear threshold.  It could happen.</p><p>But it's certainly something they want to avoid, I think India wants to avoid, and they're in a game -- sort of a game of chicken right now, and, hopefully, Pakistan will back down and India will let them back down.</p><p>DOBBS: Ambassador Kux, we hope, of course, your assessment is correct.  We thank you for being here.</p><p>KUX: Thank you very much, Lou.  Good night.</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up next, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  He says Israel is too soft on the Palestinians. Tonight, he'll tell us what needs to be done.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: In the Middle East, Israeli troops have entered the West Bank town of Nablus and a nearby refugee camp.  Israeli forces rounded up hundreds of Palestinians, and they blew up the home of a Palestinian suicide bomber.</p><p>All of this comes as diplomats have begun arriving there for talks aimed at securing an Israeli/Palestinian cease-fire.  Today, Israel's prime minister met with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State William Burns and an adviser to the president of Egypt.</p><p>Earlier, I talked with former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about prospects for peace and how to achieve peace.</p><p>Also, the former prime minister is immensely concerned about rising tensions between India and Pakistan, and I asked Mr. Netanyahu about the threat of war between the two countries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: You have to take it seriously because there might be the possibility of an unintended consequence, that is of a slip-up, and that changes our world, if that happens.</p><p>We've not had a nuclear weapon fired in anger or not in anger since Hiroshima, and that is serious enough to warrant the greatest concentration of diplomatic and other effort on the part of the United States.</p><p>But it is -- also, I think, underlines to any sane observer the importance of what the president said in his state of the union address about making sure that countries and sane countries like Iran and Iraq do not acquire nuclear weapons.</p><p>DOBBS: This administration also dispatching George Tenet. William Burns already in the region to meet with Israelis and Palestinians.  Your assessment of the prospects of success?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I have not hidden my view.  I've said it on this program, and I'll say it again. Just like old Cato in Rome, I'm not as old as Cato was, but I'm just as consistent, it is not going to work with Arafat.</p><p>It's like saying let's offer reforms for Saddam Hussein.  Let's reform the Republican Guards but keep Saddam there.  There's no possibility of a change because Arafat is not a Palestinian King Hussein with whom we made peace, Palestinian -- King Hussein of Jordan. He's a Palestinian Saddam Hussein.</p><p>And what do you do with Saddam?  You don't negotiate with him. You don't make concessions for him.  You throw him out and hope for a better leadership to emerge in the Palestinian (INAUDIBLE) with whom we can make peace.</p><p>DOBBS: You can certainly at least sympathize with the view that it's unlikely that either side will be able to dictate with whom they negotiate, should there be negotiation.  It's\u2026</p><p>NETANYAHU: I think you're right on that, but I think we should dictate with whom we don't.  We don't negotiate with somebody who sends killers our way and blows up restaurants and pizzerias and hotels.</p><p>You wouldn't do that, and you're not doing that.  In fact, you didn't negotiate with the Taliban.  You threw them out.</p><p>People who declare destruction of America as their goal and terror as their method are not partners for negotiation.  That is true of America just as it's true of those who declare war and destruction on Israel.</p><p>DOBBS: The conflict now in the Middle East is now a half-century in its length.  It shows no signs of abating or being resolved.</p><p>A Palestinian state -- clearly, the Israelis in every poll I've seen support a Palestinian state.  There is even support for the withdrawal from the settlements as a condition of creating a peace.</p><p>It's also very obvious that the Sharon government is not interested in either of those, if you will, elements in any resolution.  What will it take to make peace?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I think what it takes to make peace is, first of all, a peace partner, and I think we don't have one with Arafat.  We actually have had a mixed record when it comes to peace because we've had some good things, too.</p><p>We have peace with Jordan, peace with Egypt, because we had leaders there who spoke peace to their people and made peace with us. They were consistent internally and externally.  That is not the case with Arafat.  Arafat will have to go.</p><p>It will happen.  It may happen after Saddam is removed, but it will happen.  When it happens, I think every Israeli -- and, certainly, I include myself at the top of the list -- wants to see a future where the Palestinians govern themselves.</p><p>I don't want to govern a single Palestinian.  Not one.  I want them to govern themselves.  I want them to have complete self- determination.</p><p>DOBBS: You don't say a Palestinian state?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I don't use the word \"state\" because state implies unlimited sovereign power, such as, for example, the right to import weapons freely, and they will, or the right to make military pacts with a country like Syria or Libya or Iraq if Saddam stays in power, and so on,and the -- 99 percent of Israelis agree that the Palestinians should have self-government but should not have those powers.</p><p>The differences in Israel, which were not really understood in the public discussion about this issue, is a semantic -- you might think it's a semantic quibble, but I think it's a very important tactic.</p><p>DOBBS: It's been six months since you and I last talked.  How do you believe the war against terrorism -- the international war against terrorism is progressing?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I think it's progressing, but I think it has yet to reach the critical point, and the critical point is the dismantling of the most dangerous terrorist regimes.  The most dangerous terror regimes is the one of Iraq and Iran, which are feverishly developing nuclear weapons, and they're trying to beat the clock.</p><p>I think President Bush was right to incorporate them in the axis of evil.  He's right to prepare the American people to act, if necessary, alone to remove that threat before Saddam acquires nuclear weapons, and I think he's probably seeking to see the implosion of Iran, a much more open country than Iraq, following such a toppling of the Saddam regime.</p><p>DOBBS: I mentioned the polls in Israel which support a Palestinian state, which support a withdrawal from the settlements, conditions that would be, of course, positive and hopeful to the Palestinians.  Those polls also show strong support for Ariel Sharon.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Well, polls go up and down.  They fluctuate very rapidly, as we speak, by the way.  I don't know.  I don't know if it will be early elections because it's not controlled by me.  It's a decision that will be decided by the Knesset, our parliament.</p><p>As far as I'm concerned, when they have elections is less important than the issues facing Israel in the elections, and they are how do you assure an end to violence, how do you assure the beginning of peace, how do you restore tranquility.</p><p>I think -- I think there is a way to do it.  It is not from a position of softness, It is actually from a position of firmness.</p><p>DOBBS: Will your name be on that ballot?</p><p>NETANYAHU: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: And is it your best judgment there won't be early elections?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I don't know.  You know, right now, I'm enjoying my freedom.  There is a biblical statement made by Moses who said that power is not power, it's actually slavery, and it is not -- it is -- you are enslaved once you become powerful.  No one's holding a gun to my head or to Mr. Sharon's head or to anyone -- to anyone else.</p><p>DOBBS: Political slavery seems to be a much sought after condition.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Yeah.  It's an -- it's an interesting thing, a defamation of the human spirit, but I think every one of us who seeks that office in Israel believes that we can do something to advance peace and to -- and my point of view, my -- from my point of view, not only peace, but prosperity.</p><p>I'm, as you know, a rabid believer in free markets, and I think Israel can undergo tremendous leaps and bounds economically by democratizing and modernizing its outdated socialist system.  We have a tremendous potential.  That will benefit our Palestinian and other Arab neighbors as well.</p><p>DOBBS: Benjamin Netanyahu, as always good to talk to you.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Thank you.  Good to talk to you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks for being here.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up next, Andersen's attorney steps up the pressure on the Justice Department.  We'll have full details live from Houston.</p><p>Wall Street panelists Lakshman Achuthan, Bill Nygren, Jan Hopkins, Christine Romans, Greg Clarkin, all here to take the pulse of the market and tell us its direction.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: These are the top stories tonight.  The U.S. government is urging all Americans to leave India immediately.  Pakistan is moving more troops away from the Afghan border to its border with India.  The Pentagon estimates up to 12 million people could die if a nuclear war were to break out between the two countries.</p><p>Israeli forces have raided the West Bank city of Nablus, and a nearby refugee camp. One-hundred people detained.  Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said those raids were aimed at -- quote -- \"bringing our people to their knees,\" end quote.</p><p>And the launch of the space shuttle Endeavor has been postponed again, again because of bad weather.  Adding at least another four days to what is already a six-month stay aboard the international space station for two American astronauts.</p><p>Three-hundred of Andersen's clients have dropped the firm as auditor.  The latest blow today from local telephone company Qwest communications, a company itself on the brink.  Earlier this week, Moodie's downgraded Qwest credit rating to junk.</p><p>At the Andersen trial in Houston, the defense is now wrapping up its case.  Today attorneys cut a big hole in the government's argument that Andersen attorney Nancy Temple used cryptic e-mails to encourage the destruction of documents.  Peter Viles has the report from Houston.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Andersen attorney Rusty Hardin tackling the mystery at the heart of the Andersen trial. What did Nancy Temple have in mind last fall when she invoked the firm's document policy?  A mystery because Temple took the Fifth Amendment, will not testify.</p><p>The government alleges she sent two crucial e-mails in which she used the document policy as a code that meant to destroy Enron documents.  But Andersen partner John Stewart received one of those e- mails and he offered an innocent explanation of what it meant, testifying that last October he learned for the first time that Andersen even had such a policy.</p><p>He asked Temple to explain it to him so she sent him without comment an e-mail containing a link to the policy itself.  \"I took it to be just a courtesy,\" Stewart testified.</p><p>RUSTY HARDIN, ANDERSEN DEFENSE LAWYER: It's amazing, you know. They try to suggest this whole trial that Nancy Temple sending a message about just where you could find the document retention policy on the 19th, to John Stewart, somehow was a message to destroy documents.  Now we find out she sent it to him at his request because he wanted to look at it</p><p>VILES: On cross examination though, the government establishing that Stewart did destroy some Enron-related documents after learning of the policy, as did some of his colleagues in Chicago.  If Andersen scored points on the Temple e-mail, though, it lost a big argument about evidence. Anderson wants the jury to know that although roughly 40 boxes of Enron files were destroyed, more than 1,600 boxes were saved.</p><p>Judge Melinda Harman again sided with the government, saying that saved documents are irrelevant to this case, and that Andersen failed to give the prosecution enough time to inspect those 1,600 boxes.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>We finished today with very dramatic testimony from David Duncan's former assistant, Shannon Adlong.  She broke down in tears when she told the story of how David Duncan was fired over the shredding in January, said she spoke to him then and he told her, nobody did anything wrong, he didn't do anything wrong.  He didn't understand what was happening, but not to worry about him.</p><p>Very powerful, dramatic testimony.  And importantly, Lou, it was the last thing the jury heard before they broke for the weekend about 30 minutes ago -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: This trial concluding its fourth week.  The defense will rest when?</p><p>VILES: We expect Monday.  We thought maybe today. We think they're calling one more witness, John Riley from Chicago, who came down here to help on the Enron mess in October.  But this was very powerful testimony today from Shannon Adlong.</p><p>One more point on it.  She said when David Duncan was cleaning his own files he appeared very reluctant to do it. And he told her at the time, \"I wouldn't want our bosses to see our files in a mess.\" I would remind you, it's not a crime to try to impress your boss.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Pete, you impress yours all of the time.  And keep up the great work.  Thanks very much, Peter Viles, live from Houston.</p><p>A solid rally on Wall Street virtually collapsed today.  The markets unable to hold onto early gains.  The Dow lost 130 point advance, ending the day only 13 points higher. But that was enough to break a four-session losing streak.</p><p>For the week, the Dow lost nearly 2 percent, however.  The Nasdaq fell nearly 3 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 down 1.5 percent.</p><p>Now for our weekly Wall Street panel, I'm joined by top performing fund manager, Bill Nygren of the Oakmark Fund in Chicago, the fund manager of the year, by the way.  And congratulations. Economist Lakshman Achuthan and Jan Hopkins, Christine Romans and Greg Clarkin joining us.</p><p>I'm going to start, if I may, with you, Lakshman.  These are incredible numbers on productivity.  We're seeing some real strong reports here, even though the market shrugged it off.  What's going on?</p><p>LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN, ECONOMIC CYCLE RESEARCH INST.: Well, the market is I think focused on the geopolitical landscape and these things like Enron and reporting -- the fundamentals.  The economy very much on track.  We're seeing a classic, sequential set of data that comes out as you have an economic cycle recovery.  Today's numbers proved it.</p><p>DOBBS: Unequivocally, a recovery?  A strong recovery underway?</p><p>ACHUTHAN: A sustained recovery.  I think there's a difference between\u2026</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: I love it when economists parse.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Well, you know, the average first quarter recovery in the post-war period, 7.3 percent GDP growth.  This one we have 5.6. So we're already in a sub-par recovery, which a lot of people are saying is great.  Fine, I'll take it.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you for that, because I really did not know that.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: First quarter GDP recovery in the postwar period, 7.3 percent.  This at 5.6 is sub-par. We're going to come down from that a bit.</p><p>DOBBS: Now I'm disappointed.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Hey, it's better than a recession.  And it's done the right thing.  It's set us up for some sustained growth going forward.</p><p>DOBBS: Let me go to Bill Nygren.  Bill, you have done a remarkable job in this market.  How do you feel about the environment, the conditions of the market and the economy?  And is that playing any part in your investment decisions?</p><p>BILL NYGREN, FUND MANAGER, OAKMARK FUND: Well, Lou, we basically approach things from a bottom up approach, trying to find individual stocks that look cheap.  I would say overall that the market looks to us to be relatively fairly valued. It ought to return a little bit more than bonds going forward.  But nothing like the teens to 20 percent returns that people got used to in the late '90s.</p><p>We're seeing a shift in the stocks that look attractive.  At this point I would say we're not believers that the economy is in a traditional recovery. Rather, we'd see it as bouncing back somewhat from an artificial depressant last fall.  And still up in the air, whether or not the recovery will be as good as usual.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: What are the main things, Bill, that are making you hesitant about the sustainability of the recovery?</p><p>NYGREN: I think one of the big things would be the strength we've seen in the consumer market, all the way through the recession. We haven't seen the typical depressants there to recover from.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: But then, I mean, you still have the consumer hanging in there now.  And their confidence, even numbers today, seem to look pretty good.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, they looked good and it's all about stock for Bill. Let me ask you, Bill, what are you buying right now?  What do you own?</p><p>NYGREN: Well, our largest holding, my favorite stock idea is Washington Mutual, largest savings and loan in the United States. Sells at less than 10 times earnings.  It's been growing 15 percent a year.  That means when you think about it on a five-year time frame, like we do, they ought to see earnings growth something like 100 percent over five years.</p><p>The P.E. is at nine times, the market's in the 20s.  So even the multiples got a chance to grow by 100 percent.  So I think for someone who's willing to take a five-year time frame, a stock that's out of favor like Washington Mutual offers great potential.</p><p>DOBBS: You were talking about 100 percent over five years. There are those who suggest we've got to adjust our expectations. What should an investor be looking for, in terms of a realistic appreciation in their portfolio over the course of any given year, in this new world of ours?</p><p>NYGREN: I think if you think about a one-year time frame, a long-term government bond gets between 5 and 6 percent.  Maybe a reasonable return for the stock market is something like 8 percent, which if you think about five years, that's a 50 percent rate of return.  So we'd like to think that our successful ideas could do at least twice that.</p><p>DOBBS: Terrific.  Now, you also still own AT&amp;T, right?</p><p>NYGREN: Yes, we do.</p><p>DOBBS: Beaten badly.</p><p>NYGREN: It certainly hasn't helped us this year so far.  Stocks down significantly.  But we think the Comcast shares that you'll get in the deal this fall, late this year, are worth almost $10 per share. That leaves you paying less than $2 for their telephony operations.</p><p>And I'm certainly not going to argue that that's an average or above average business.  But at that low price, I can't imagine that that business is worth less than that.  We think it's worth several hundred percent more than a $2 price per share.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, let me turn to Jan and to Greg and Christine for the wrap-up. You guys get the last words.  What can we expect next week?</p><p>JAN HOPKINS, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS: We're starting into the summer season.  I think that investors are very depressed because of what is going on overseas.  But from what both of these guys are saying, maybe from summer on we're going to have a rally. Because we're down so far this year.</p><p>DOBBS: Do you agree, Greg?</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS: At the moment, for big tech at least, it feels like more of the same.  You have the constant drumbeat of lack of confidence in corporate America.  Adelphia being delisted, the sixth-largest cable company in the country.  Big tech traders I talk to at this point say it's a torturous market.</p><p>DOBBS: Adelphia, though, is not really representative of the cable industry though, is it?</p><p>CLARKIN: No, unique circumstances here.  But certainly it drives home the point the balance sheets may be in some cases not to be trusted.</p><p>DOBBS: Christine?</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS: Lou, you can't talk about Wall Street this week without talking about the World Trade Center recovery ending and the mood that was on the Street this week.  It was a very quiet day on Thursday.  Two minutes of silence, and Wall Street investors and traders and the whole community down there, still grappling with what happened here six months ago.</p><p>You can see it in the way we're behaving in the market.  And you can see it on the faces down there.  So it's important to remember that, to keep this in perspective this week too.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely.  Thank you all very much.  Let's look for a better week.</p><p>A quick reminder to give us your opinion on tonight's MONEYLINE quick vote.  The question: do you think we are winning the war against terrorism?  Log on to cnn.com/moneyline to cast your vote.  We'll have the results for you coming right up.  .</p><p>Still ahead here, one of the world's oldest motorcycle makers roaring back to life.  A special report next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Before Harley Davidson, there was Indian, a legendary American motorcycle with a rich but checkered history.  Now with the arrival of summer, a growing number of us are hopping aboard big motorcycles and fueling the revival of a two-wheeled classic.  Casey Wian reports from Gilroy, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's rare to see a CEO squeeze into chaps for a television interview.  But Frank O'Connell, like many of the 400 employees at Indian Motorcycle, is a longtime biker, well aware of Indian's legendary reputation.</p><p>FRANK O'CONNELL, CEO, INDIAN MOTORCYCLE: Indian was known for phenomenal styling and beautiful, soft lines in those big fenders, and the beautiful, big seats.</p><p>WIAN: Once the world's largest motorcycle maker, Indian went out of business in 1953, conceding the U.S. market to Harley Davidson. Several attempts to revive the brand stalled.</p><p>In 1998 a court awarded rights to the Indian branch to a Harley clone maker in Gilroy, California, best known as the garlic capital of the world.</p><p>Making bikes by hand, the company got off to a fast start.  Too fast, says O'Connell, who was hired two years ago when Indian was almost out of cash, again.  He trimmed staff and production, raised $45 million from investors -- money needed to transform Indian from a kit bike maker to a full-fledged manufacturer.</p><p>Then came September 11.</p><p>O'CONNELL: We did a piece of research and we found out what happened was, basically the consumer psychology shifted and said, life is short.  Do it now.  Buy American.  And because we've got an American icon brand and so many comeback riders have been dreaming about it, actually our sales jumped.</p><p>WIAN: During the past 5 years, sales of the biggest motorcycles have grown by more than 15 percent annually.  Indian has about 2 percent of that market and hopes to more than double that share.</p><p>TIM CONDOR, A.G. EDWARDS: While they are producing some units, they're still in the very small scale as it relates to the overall larger players of the market.</p><p>WIAN: Indian makes three models, priced from $17,000 to $23,000. O'Connell predicts profitability by next year.</p><p>(on camera): To put things in perspective, Indian has a long way to go to catch Harley Davidson.  Indian plans to build about 6,000 motorcycles this year. Harley Davidson, a quarter of a million.  Casey Wian, CNN Financial News, Gilroy, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, a new movie starring Ben Affleck contains some chilling scenes of a terrorist attack.  \"Variety's\" Peter Bart will be her to tell us how audiences are likely to respond.  That and a lot more still ahead. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: A couple new offerings at the box office this weekend. Life imitates art in the latest Tom Clancy adaptation, \"The Sum of All Fears.\" Ben Affleck portrays CIA agent Jack Ryan trying to stop terrorists from attacking America.  And comedy \"Undercover Brother\" based on urban media's popular Web site series, stars Eddie Griffin and Denise Richards.</p><p>Here to talk about whether audiences are ready for this rather controversial \"Sum of All Fears\" movie, I'm joined by Peter Bart, editor in chief of \"Variety.\" Peter, good to have you here.  How do you think audiences are going to respond?</p><p>PETER BART, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"VARIETY\": It's a question mark.  I mean, this is a pretty tough picture, in that it shows Baltimore getting nuked.  And the body count is quite significant.  So you can argue that this is certainly a picture of the moment.  Or you can argue that this may prove to be something that the public doesn't particularly want to embrace.</p><p>DOBBS: A difficult time for a movie like this to come out, I suppose.  What would be your best judgment?  Have they made a mistake in releasing the movie, or do you think it may have a high curiosity factor?</p><p>BART: I don't know, I think that the picture will prove initially quite successful.  I don't know whether it's going to sustain legs.  The other marginal thing about it is, Ben Affleck inherited the Harrison Ford role.  And he sort of lacks the gravitas of someone who is an expert in Russian history, that the American president talks to for background about the new Russian head of state. So Ben might be a little miscast.  But still, it's a suspenseful picture.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I'm -- with all apologies to Ben Affleck, I think Harrison Ford nailed the character.</p><p>(UNINTELLIGIBLE) their boards are becoming more helpful to the CEOs.  Messier happy to come away with his job.  Eisner doesn't strike me, if memory serves correctly, as a fellow who enjoys a lot of support.  What do you think?</p><p>BART: I think Messier Lewis had a tough ride lately, too. You're talking about a debt of $30 billion, and an incredibly aggressive acquisitions program. But I think both boards are reflecting the pressure on directors around the corporate spectrum. And that is, I think boards, these boards are sitting up committees of governance.</p><p>I love that weird word, governance.  Basically what it reflects is that the directors want to keep closer tabs on what's going on in the company, and on its future plans.  Of course, Eisner's contract doesn't run out until 2006.  Messier could have a bouncier ride, but he's supported by his fellow Frenchmen on that board.</p><p>DOBBS: All right.  Peter Bart, as always, good to have you with us. Have a great weekend.</p><p>BART: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: And we'll see how \"Sum of All Fears\" does.</p><p>Now for the results of our MONEYLINE quick vote tonight.  The question, do you think we are winning the war against terrorism?  And some interesting answers here.  Again, this is not scientific.  But 15 percent -- 16 percent voted yes.  And 84 percent vote no.</p><p>\"CROSSFIRE\" begins in just a few minutes.  Paul Begala, Robert Novak to tell us what's ahead. Gentlemen, tell us all about it.</p><p>PAUL BEGALA, \"CROSSFIRE\": Well, Lou, you probably saw today \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page called on the new FBI director to resign.  He's only been in office 9 months.  Of course, as you know, that page is so far right it's wrong on everything, in my eyes.  But we'll put the FBI in the \"CROSSFIRE\" versus the ACLU, with the top official from the FBI now retired and the top official from the ACLU.</p><p>ROBERT NOVAK, \"CROSSFIRE\": And, Lou, we're going to ask the Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. what her country is going to do to prevent a terrible nuclear war with India that would cost millions of lives.</p><p>And on a lighter tone, one thing that Paul and I agree on 100 percent, that soccer is boring.  Well talk about how bad the World Cup is with an American leader in the soccer movement who thinks it's wonderful.</p><p>DOBBS: Bob, I don't know what to say.  I agree with both of you once again.  And like me, you've got to be just shocked and delighted that Paul is at least reading the pages of \"The Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NOVAK: I think he has it read for him.</p><p>BEGALA: Lou, I read both \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page and the Bible.  So I know what both sides are up to, each day, the good guys and the evil side.</p><p>DOBBS: The great thing is, you can follow both, Paul, and be righteous.  Thanks, gentlemen.  We look forward to watching the show.</p><p>Tonight the entire state of Colorado has been declared a federal disaster area.  That, because of a drought.  The state has been plagued by what is now a long-term drought by any definition.  Farming accounts for $16 billion of the state of Colorado's economy.  And this year more than 550,000 acres of wheat have been lost to drought.  One official there says the state will need as much as three years of rain to reverse the severe drought conditions.</p><p>Coming up next, the \"Dobbs Report\" and a few thoughts on what appears to be a changing tone in this administration.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(AUDIO/VIDEO GAP) TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fdch.com\">www.fdch.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2002053101CNV19</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4945-43M0-009B-G1C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7376\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>May 31, 2002 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHERS NV\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHERS NV\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANNOUNCER: This is LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE for Tuesday, November 6.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, HOST: Good evening, everyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The United States continues to bomb terrorists in Afghanistan, and Osama bin Laden raises the stakes.  He's looking for nuclear weapons.  The United States is looking for more support from its allies.  We'll have the report for you.</p><p>And then, are U.S. efforts to build support in the Middle East straining relations with Israel and complicating the war against terrorism?  Former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will join us.</p><p>We'll also be joined by Bernadine Healy.  Dr. Healy is the outgoing president of the Red Cross.  She'll tell us where the money donated for the September 11 victims and their families is going and why she is resigning.</p><p>On Wall Street, stock prices soar as interest rates fall.  The Fed cut interest rates for the 10th time this year today.  We'll tell you how this cut may or may not help the economy and the markets.</p><p>And major league baseball owners have overwhelmingly voted to reduce the number of teams in major league baseball by two.</p><p>In the latest developments in the war against terrorism, U.S. jets pummeled Taliban targets by day and night today.  A CNN cameraman saw several explosions followed by plumes of smoke near Bagram. Today, Northern Alliance commanders claim to have captured the town of Kisindeh, just south of the city of Mazar-e Sharif.</p><p>The Northern Alliance also says five Taliban commanders and 400 of their soldiers defected.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld would not comment on those claims.</p><p>The Pentagon saying U.S. jets and bombers carried out 100 sorties yesterday, focusing their attention on the support of opposition forces.  Rumsfeld says the increased number of sorties is the result of better targeting information from ground forces.</p><p>President Bush warning Europe for the first time that Osama bin Laden is looking for nuclear weapons and that freedom in Europe is at risk.</p><p>John King joins us from the White House with more.  John?</p><p>JOHN KING, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, that escalating rhetoric from the president today part of a carefully calculated White House verbal offensive, if you will, to back up the fifth week of the military strikes.  Some indications from public opinion polling in Europe that support for the U.S.-led campaign is dropping, skepticism rising.</p><p>Some Arab leaders, of course, have called for a cessation of bombing during the coming holy period, the Muslim holy period of Ramadan. But Mr. Bush serving notice today that the bombing will go on.  He said for the first time something the CIA has said for several years, voicing the belief that Osama bin Laden is trying to acquire not only chemical and biological weapons but perhaps nuclear weapons as well.</p><p>And after saying that in a speech delivered via satellite to an antiterrorism conference in Warsaw, Poland, the president had a blunt message for anyone who thinks the bombing campaign is about to end. Mr. Bush served notice it is just beginning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are at the beginning of our efforts in Afghanistan.  And Afghanistan is the beginning of our efforts in the world.  No group or nation should mistake America's intentions.  We will not rest until terrorist groups of global reach have been found, have been stopped, and have been defeated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Mr. Bush also saying that in a speech Saturday to the United Nations General Assembly, he would make clear in very blunt terms that words of sympathy were not enough, that he expected all nations to step up and contribute in the war on terrorism.</p><p>And Lou, a late-breaking development here tonight on the domestic front, a very blunt meeting, we are told, between the president and congressional appropriators tonight in the budget battle.  Many in Congress want to spend an additional $20 billion above a previous agreement with the president on the domestic war against terrorism. We're told the president looked them in the eye tonight and said he would veto that measure, that he believed there was enough money to go around.</p><p>A lot of talk of the bipartisan cooperation in recent weeks around this town, the president in a major showdown with both Democrats and the Republicans in Congress tonight.</p><p>Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: John, any idea where that number $20 billion came from on the part o the congressional representatives in that meeting?</p><p>KING: There are a number of appropriators in Congress who believe much of that money would go to homeland defense issues, airline security, more aid for law enforcement around the country, steps (ph).  One member we're told tonight told the president point- blank at this meeting, Americans are afraid to take their children to school, they're afraid to go shopping.  We need to spend more on homeland security.</p><p>The president, I am told by senior officials, looked him right back and said he believes there's enough money in the budget to fund all priorities, and if they need more next year, come back and do it as part of next year's budget battle.</p><p>The president opened the meeting, though, by saying he would veto that legislation.  I'm told more than one appropriator looked him right back and said, We don't think you will, Mr. President.</p><p>DOBBS: John King from the White House, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, senators frustrated with the lack of progress in the anthrax investigation grilling FBI agents during a hearing on Capitol Hill today.  FBI agents were unable to provide answers to questions about the number of laboratories which produce anthrax, or whether the perpetrators are in the United States or abroad.</p><p>We'll have a live report for you from Washington in just a moment.</p><p>Anthrax tests now show that Food and Drug Administration buildings do not, do not contain anthrax.  Initial anthrax tests showed they did.  Mail room employees at those FDA buildings were given antibiotics as a precaution.</p><p>A New York City hospital that closed because of an anthrax scare today opened.  The Manhattan Eye, Ear, and Throat Hospital closed a week ago after a female stockroom employee was diagnosed and then later died from inhalation anthrax.</p><p>Anthrax has been discovered in a diplomatic mail bag received by the U.S. Consulate in Ykaterinberg (ph), Russia.  The mail originated at the State Department in Washington.  It is the first known anthrax case in Russia since anthrax was discovered in Boca Raton, Florida, a month ago.</p><p>As we reported, the FBI under fire on Capitol Hill today.  FBI officials criticized after saying they did not know the source of anthrax that has now killed four Americans.</p><p>Jeanne Meserve joins us now.  She has the story on the FBI anthrax investigation.  Jeanne?</p><p>JEANNE MESERVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lou, the FBI has not come up with many answers in its anthrax inquiry, and today members of the Senate wanted to know why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), CALIFORNIA: How many labs handle anthrax in the United States?</p><p>JAMES CARUSO, FBI COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERT: We do not know that at this time.  I can assure you\u2026</p><p>FEINSTEIN: You don't know that?</p><p>CARUSO: No, we do not.  We're pressing hard to determine that.</p><p>FEINSTEIN: Could you possibly tell me why you do not know that?</p><p>CARUSO: The research, the research capabilities of thousands of researchers is something that we're just continuing to run down.  I know it's an unsatisfactory answer and unsatisfying to us as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MESERVE: That was James Caruso, the FBI's deputy assistant for counterterrorism.  He made the point to the senators that thousands of people from around the world have come to the U.S. and received educations that might have given them the knowhow to handle anthrax. Some are still here, some are gone.</p><p>Caruso said that the FBI had 7,000 people spread around the world working the case, but, he said, FBI resources have been stretched because of the number of hoaxes involving anthrax and other potential weapons of mass destruction have gone, in his words, \"off the charts.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARUSO: Since mid-September, the FBI has responded to approximately 7,089 suspicious anthrax letters, 950 incidents involving other WMD matters, such as bomb threats, and an estimated 29,331 telephone calls from the public about suspicious packages.</p><p>The vast majority of these responses were not actual incidents.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MESERVE: Hoaxes not only drain law enforcement and public health resources, they take a psychological toll.  And for all those reasons, officials have promised repeatedly that people who perpetrate hoaxes will be prosecuted.  But today a Justice Department official told the senators there should be some new legislation.  Current statutes, he said, simply leave too many loopholes -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Jeanne, did the FBI officials suggest to the senators that there was some time frame here where they expected results?</p><p>MESERVE: Absolutely not, Lou.  Absolutely no mention of any time frame whatsoever, just that they are applying all the resources they have to this investigation, and they hope to get some answers -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: OK.  And we are, after all, one month into this unfortunate process.  Jeanne Meserve, thank you very much.</p><p>MONEYLINE has learned that authorities are investigating the role U.S. banks played in providing a pipeline for terrorist funding.  As Chris Huntington reports, when the order came to freeze al-Qaeda's assets, authorities didn't have to look far from ground zero.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRIS HUNTINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just blocks from ground zero, federal law enforcement agents are scouring accounts at major U.S. money center banks.  Of the $4 million of terrorist assets currently frozen in the United States, federal officials say that a significant portion is in accounts managed by Citibank, J.P. MorganChase, the Bank of New York, and Bank of America.</p><p>SEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: One of the most dramatic proofs that our banks have been misused by foreign terrorists is bin Laden's comment when he said that his operatives knew the cracks in our banking system and our financial institutions like they knew the lines on the -- their hands.</p><p>HUNTINGTON: The investigators are particularly concerned that terrorists found a back door into the U.S. banking system by exploiting a service known as correspondent banking.  A correspondent account with a U.S. bank allows banks based overseas to conduct business in the United States without the expense or regulatory exposure of setting up their own branches.</p><p>All major U.S. banks provide correspondent accounts, collecting billions of dollars in fees for processing trillions of dollars in transactions.</p><p>IRWIN NACK, NEW YORK BANKING DEPARTMENT: The problem with correspondent banking is, it allows banks which may be operating in jurisdictions that don't have strong money-laundering laws, that they're not subjected to the kind of supervision that we have here in the United States.</p><p>ROBERT MORGENTHAU, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY: There can be a shell bank in the Cayman Islands.  They can have an account with a major U.S. bank or the foreign branch of a U.S. bank or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank, and then they can send terrorist money through and nobody's going to be able to identify it.</p><p>HUNTINGTON: Earlier this year, a Senate panel issued a blistering report on correspondent banking, calling it a \"gateway for money laundering,\" \"a widespread and ongoing problem,\" and blasting U.S. bank oversight as weak or ineffective.</p><p>The banking industry insists it did a good job.</p><p>EDWARD YINGLING, AMERICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION: For a few years preceding September 11, there actually had been an ongoing strengthening of procedures in the larger banks with respect to correspondent accounts.</p><p>HUNTINGTON: Still, the terrorists found a weak link.  In June of last year, Mohammed Atta received $100,000 in a Sun Trust bank account in Florida wired from a bank in the United Arab Emirates.  That transfer was made through a correspondent bank account.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>For years, U.S. banks have been required to know their customers. That's a skill for which they have shown little commitment.  Under new anti-money-laundering laws passed last week, banks handling correspondent accounts will need to go a step further and know their customers' customer -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Chris, I couldn't help but notice the American Bankers Association representative was talking with you.  This is the same group who were lobbying against that provision for tighter controls in that antiterrorism bill just two weeks ago.</p><p>HUNTINGTON: Lobbied against the bill and then, in the final weeks and days when it was clear that it was going to pass, they rallied on board and kind of claimed full partnership.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it's a partnership due.</p><p>Chris, thanks.  Chris Huntington.</p><p>Still ahead here on MONEYLINE, Americans are angry with some charities and the pace with which they are disbursing money to victims and the families of victims of the September 11 attacks.</p><p>Red Cross president Bernadine Healy appeared on Capitol Hill to answer one burning question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SENATOR: In the eight weeks since the events of September 11, thousands and thousands of Americans have reached into their pockets and their checkbooks and written -- given their money to the Red Cross.  Can you assure them today that every dime of those contributions will go to heal the wounds\u2026</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We will have Dr. Healy's answer.  We will be repeating the question as well.  And we have a few others when she joins us later.</p><p>And a former Israeli prime minister will join us in a matter of moments to discuss how America's new war is affecting the prospects of peace in the Middle East.</p><p>All of that and a lot more still ahead on MONEYLINE.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: After the break, Lou is joined by Benjamin Netanyahu, former prime minister of Israel.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: In the latest developments in the war against terrorism, the federal government today announcing it's hiring 225 additional security employees, that on a temporary basis, trying to improve security at airports around the country.  The Federal Aviation Administration says those employees will begin working within the next few weeks.</p><p>CNN has learned that information that prompted warnings about a possible attack on bridges in Western states was not credible.  Last week, the FBI warned six Western states about the possibility of such an attack but stressed the credibility of that information was unknown, and in fact uncorroborated.</p><p>California's governor, Gray Davis, went public with that threat.</p><p>More fighting and more death in the Middle East today, Israeli and Palestinian forces battling in the West Bank. And with the United States preoccupied with the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, peace talks have all but stalled.</p><p>Joining us now, former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>Good to have you with us.</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Good to be with you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: At this point, within the larger context of the war against terrorism, are there any prospects for significant developments for peace in -- between Israel and the Palestinians?</p><p>NETANYAHU: The Palestinian dictator, Yassir Arafat, happens to be the only man who qualifies under President Bush's categories of being both a perpetrator of terrorism and a harborer of terrorists. He's both bin Laden and Taliban.  So I think the important thing is if -- the first road to peace is to stop the terror, and to tell Arafat what Tony Blair and President Bush have told him, surrender terrorism or surrender power.</p><p>You can't have peace while Israel is being blown up all the time.</p><p>DOBBS: But you negotiated and negotiated in point of fact successfully with Yassir Arafat\u2026</p><p>NETANYAHU: You know how?  I stopped the terror.  I told him it's either stopping the terror, or your regime goes down.  That tended to concentrate his thinking.  And in fact, he stopped the terror.  And that's how I could get negotiations.  The pre -- the\u2026 I would say the precondition for negotiations is to have Arafat dismantle this terror apparatus that he's unleashed against Israel, because I think as long as the terror goes on, you wouldn't negotiate with bin Laden or with the Taliban, and neither would we.</p><p>DOBBS: And the position that Israel is in now within the context of the larger war against terrorism, larger in the sense of involving now 60 nations, what does this do to Israeli interests?</p><p>NETANYAHU: Well, I think it's probably a very healthy thing that the United States has taken the charge against the war on terrorism. I think that the only way that you will win, we will win, the democracies will win, all the countries affected by terrorism will win, is if the U.S. makes it very clear, terrorism is unacceptable anywhere.</p><p>DOBBS: You don't think the president has done that?</p><p>NETANYAHU: He has certainly said it.  Now it's important to follow through.  And that means two things.  One, that you go not only after the terror organizations but the regimes that harbor them, and he's doing that, first in Afghanistan, and as Washington is signaling very, very clearly, there'll be other stops after Afghanistan.</p><p>DOBBS: He repeated that signal today.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Very important.  Secondly, that terrorism -- that fighting terrorism is legitimate for those who are attacked, and I think that has to be understood as well.</p><p>The most important thing that is going to happen is that the various countries on the sidelines, who are either blackmailed by terrorism and pay them, for example, Saudi Arabia, or others who have refused to uproot the terrorist, there are some Middle Eastern regimes, who are sitting on the sidelines.  They're saying, If you want to include us in the coalition, don't hit this terrorist, don't hit that regime.</p><p>You have to say no.  Come back to basic principles.  You're either with us or against us. And we are sticking -- stick to the mission, don't worry about the coalition. The coalition is less important.</p><p>DOBBS: The president has actually articulated that, as you know. He has said that the coalition will not define the mission, the mission will define the coalition.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Right on. Couldn't agree with him more.</p><p>DOBBS: And to the degree to which Israel must constrain itself within this war against terror and the implications it might have for the success, what do you think of those constraints?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I think Israel has been extraordinarily constrained. I mean, we have pretty enormous firepower.  We're not using our jets, we're not using our firepower. We're trying to surgically strike at terrorists.</p><p>By the way, that's not particularly effective, because when you\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: (inaudible), I'm sorry, which is not particularly effective?</p><p>NETANYAHU: The surgical strikes is effective in the sense of stopping a particular kamikaze suicide bombing coming at you, but unless you go after the carrier, the aircraft carrier, you can't stop the terror.  The aircraft carrier happens to be in this case Arafat's regime, which has suicide kindergarten camps, Lou, suicide kindergarten camps, where 3-year-old Palestinian children are taught to be martyrs, suicide martyrs.</p><p>Unless you go after that regime, you cannot neutralize terrorism.</p><p>DOBBS: In the hierarchy of priorities here, obviously the United States has made the determination it will be, the president has said it will be al-Qaeda, it will be the Taliban.  What is your personal judgment as to the rest of the priorities in that hierarchy?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I think this is an obvious and natural starting place.  But the president too has said that this is not the last stop, for the following reason.  You have really a terror network that consists of about two dozen terror organizations that are satellites of terror regimes.  There are about half a dozen.  The most prominent ones, other than Afghanistan, which has bin Laden's situation there, are Iran, Iraq, Syria, the Palestinian dictatorship, and one or two other Middle Eastern states.</p><p>That's it.  If you can neutralize these regimes, and I stress the word regimes rather than the organizations, because the terrorists are not suspended in midair, they can't function for long without an enviable (ph) base that the regime provides.</p><p>DOBBS: As you've pointed out more than once.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Indeed, and that's the key to fighting terrorism. The key to fighting terrorism is not fighting the terrorist organizations, it's fighting the terrorist regimes.  I think if he proceeds on this plan that he's charted so ably and so clearly, I think he'll get the American people behind him, I think it's much more important whether Saudi Arabia or any one of these countries is behind.</p><p>I think if he stays the course, he'll win.  We'll all win.</p><p>DOBBS: It's clear the American people are behind the president and this administration in this war, this new war, as the president says.  In terms of homeland security, former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge is now in charge of homeland security, director of homeland security.  What is your sense?  Because you have had to live and to administer a government, a sovereign nation, in the midst of terrorism.</p><p>What is your sense of the security within the United States and the steps we must take?</p><p>NETANYAHU: You need to upgrade domestic security. It's not easy to do, but I think that you're well on your way.  And I think it'll take a year or two to debug this, maybe more.  But you're already taking care of aviation security.  It took us quite a while.  We didn't become instantaneously adept at this, you know.  It's an unfortunate accumulation of experience, sometimes very painful experience.</p><p>But I think the most important thing is this.  Other than going on the attack against the offend -- the perpetrators of terrorism, the other thing that you have to do is condition the public to be vigilant and, in many ways, to also accept the inevitable civilian casualties that will accompany an aggressive war against terrorism.</p><p>You don't end terrorism in one shot.  Sometimes there are bouts. Sometimes the terrorists will strike back, until those regimes and those organizations understand that it's over.  And the response of the American public has been on the whole, I think, very good.  And very courageous.  I think people are obviously anxious, but they're giving that backing, and they know that there may be additional casualties.</p><p>That is not stopping the United States government, as best as I can see, nor the American people.</p><p>DOBBS: Benjamin Netanyahu, good to have you with us.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: We will be continuing, and when we do, U.S.-led attacks hitting Taliban targets in Afghanistan tonight.  We'll have the latest for you in the war over Afghanistan.</p><p>Then, Red Cross president Bernadine Healy under fire on Capitol Hill today.

There were more holdouts refusing to go along with the agreement than there were states willing to sign on the bottom line.  The nine states that approved after marathon negotiations included Ohio, Louisiana, and New York.</p><p>ELIOT SPITZER, NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL: What we get is an opening of the marketplace.  And what we get is a substantial improvement over the deal that was inked by the Department of Justice last Friday.</p><p>YOUNG: But nine states including Connecticut, California, Iowa, and the District of Columbia said no, mindful, perhaps, of Microsoft's violation of a previous consent decree it signed with the government in 1994.</p><p>RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL: The settlement reached today reflects a triumph of hope over history.

It now seems that it will be six months at the very soonest before the settlement, perhaps toughened by the holdout states, could go into effect -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Steve, thank you.  Steve Young from Washington.</p><p>Investors today sparking a late session rally, stocks higher after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a half percentage point.  This is the 10th interest rate cut of the year.  It brings the Fed funds rate down to 2 percent.  That is the lowest level in four decades.</p><p>The Dow Jones industrials gained 150 points at the close, the Nasdaq surging 41 points, and the S&amp;P 500 rose 15 points.</p><p>Let's turn now to Christine Romans and Greg Clarkin, who were following this story from the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Kind of an exciting day.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS: It really was, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: To say the least.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, there was some Hewlett-Packard drama, and then there was a Fed cut and there were some earnings, and there was strong buying heading into the closing bell.  So things look pretty good. Traders liked the feel.  The question is, a lot of people were talking about sustainability.  There are some people who still think the market needs to retest at least some of the distance it's crossed over the past several weeks.</p><p>And so there are those holdouts who think you got to go back to refresh things, you got to go back lower.</p><p>DOBBS: Greg?</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS: You know, we are heading into a quiet period, so it's going to be really interesting to see where the markets go from here.  The Nasdaq up about 27 percent in five weeks' time, a tremendous gain.  The Federal cut today really giving the impetus for the Nasdaq to get over 1800 in a significant fashion, 1835 was the close.  We haven't seen that since late August.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it is a dramatic recovery from that week of September 17, when we watched a trillion dollars ripped out of the market.</p><p>But also, within context, the Na -- the Dow is off 11 percent since the beginning of the year, after 10 interest rate cuts, the Nasdaq off 20 percent, just about 21 percent.  There's a lot of pain still out there.</p><p>CLARKIN: Oh, without a doubt.  But we're hearing from a lot of traders and fund managers that, you know, they're looking at big tech, at least they have been in the last five weeks, as a fairly decent place to park money for a while.  Now, whether that continues, obviously, is another story.  But they're less\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Did you say \"park money\"?</p><p>CLARKIN: Exactly.  Yes, (inaudible)\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: That is a frightening expression.</p><p>CLARKIN: It's one I hear often.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Then you're a much braver individual, but we knew that, than me.</p><p>Christine, tell me you haven't heard about parking.</p><p>ROMANS: I have.  Well, because interest rates are just so low now that the folks are saying that if they want to put their money to work, they're starting to look at the stock market, saying if you've got a long enough time horizon, things just got to get better.</p><p>They're trying to anticipate this recovery, but they just don't what it's going to look like.</p><p>DOBBS: Expectations for tomorrow, since we're focused here on the short-term?</p><p>CLARKIN: A lot of folks I spoke with said they would not be surprised at all to see a bit of a pullback.  It's natural at this point.  The Nasdaq, again, after a tremendous run.  Would not be surprised at all, see it give back.</p><p>ROMANS: I'm hearing -- that it follows through.</p><p>DOBBS: Terrific.  Christine, Greg, as always, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, Wall Street is betting the Fed's interest rate cuts will be enough to help fire up the economy.  But after 10 cuts this year, is the Fed achieving anything? Economics correspondent Kathleen Hays is here tonight and she has more on that.</p><p>Kathleen?</p><p>KATHLEEN HAYS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>Well, you know, you asked a provocative question.  And I think one way of looking at it, people say look\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: That's what I do here.</p><p>HAYS: I like that.  If we didn't have all these rate cuts, where would the economy be and where would the stock market be?  That's one way to think about.  It may be in a lot worse shape.</p><p>We showed you that chart of how much the Fed has already cut. You say to yourself, \"What is the Fed so worried about?\" Let's look at their policy statement, because they outlined it very neatly and nicely, as they always do.</p><p>For starters, they talk about heightened economic uncertainty. We're showing you, of course, this dramatic step down in rates. Deteriorating business conditions.  In other words, we still think things are getting worse, and are focused not just on weakness here, but weakness overseas.  Japan in another recession.  Europe weakening. All these are worries on the Fed's plate.</p><p>Now I got some interesting research from Credit Suisse First Boston this afternoon about what they see next.  Basically, the rule of thumb is, as long as unemployment is rising, the Fed will keep cutting rates.  So they see unemployment going up to 6.25 percent. It's now at 5.4, in 2002.</p><p>They say the Fed is going cut at the next three meetings, which is December, January, and March, and that the funds rate is going to bottom at 1 percent.  Now that is a very extreme forecast, because other people are saying, hey, look, we've got mortgage refinances.  We had record auto sales in October.</p><p>But that is maybe looking for too much from the Fed.  In other words, that the rate cuts, even if they're not firing up the stock market yet and firing up the economy, some people think they're keeping our head above water and that, but the Fed might be closer to finishing than keep going.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, at this point, they're talking about three rate cuts.  That would take us to maybe two quarter -- cuts and a half. What would be the sequence?</p><p>HAYS: They're looking for 50 and -- no, 50 and two 25s.  A lot more.</p><p>DOBBS: A downward direction, all right.</p><p>HAYS: Yes.  So maybe those stock market bulls will be ready to go, yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it's about time.</p><p>HAYS: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: It's been a tough couple years.</p><p>HAYS: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Kathleen, thank you.</p><p>Well, joining us now for more on today's interest rate cut, and to tell us whether it will prove effective in moving this economy back on a winning trajectory, Ed Yardeni of Deutsche Bank Securities.</p><p>Ed, always good have you here.</p><p>ED YARDENI, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Thank you very much.</p><p>DOBBS: 50 basis points.  The consensus was right.  This is a strong move by the Fed, isn't it?</p><p>YARDENI: This has been a very market friendly Fed.  I mean, every time the villagers call out for a half point cut, the Fed delivers.  And so far, so good.  And looks as though the markets are asking for another half point cut.  We'll probably get one shortly.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the villagers are beset with problems.  As I said, these averages are off significantly, despite 10 interest rate cuts. What more can the villagers cry out for?</p><p>YARDENI: Right.  Well, you know, I mean when you look at the economy, remember the cash burn problem in dotcoms?  Now we've got it in airlines.  Now we've got it in the auto industry.  There's a lot of companies that are burning cash.</p><p>And the economy is not in a recession yet, but it's awfully close to it.  The reason it hasn't really fallen in is because companies are giving away the store, literally.  I mean, the auto industry had amazing car sales in October, but it's not sustainable.</p><p>DOBBS: Not sustainable because of the great incentives that they're offering?</p><p>YARDENI: Yes, I mean, Lou, how long can companies cut prices to bring the consumers in, and then realize it's awful for profits and fire the workers?  Some things just doesn't add up here.  At some point, there's a real risk the workers, consumers are going to get concerned about their jobs.</p><p>DOBBS: And the auto companies, what you're suggesting, are bringing next year's sales?</p><p>YARDENI: I guarantee you the car sales are going down big time in December and January! There's no way you can sustain this extraordinary pace maybe past November.</p><p>DOBBS: Past November, the implications then further layoffs?</p><p>YARDENI: Well, unfortunately, the consumer recession may still be ahead of us.  I mean, the unemployment rate, I agree, is going higher.  Companies are certainly firing workers.  People are not going to get the bonuses they're used to.  It's all going to come together at a very bad time.</p><p>DOBBS: You have to be a little amused as you sit next to Kathleen there, listening to a CSFB forecast on unemployment.  I think we've got to give you at least equal opportunity to give us a forecast.</p><p>YARDENI: Yes, I think we'll see 6 percent, probably by the end of year.  And I wouldn't be surprised if we see as much as 7 percent by March, April.  The good news\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Put that in some context though.  That would be another million jobs at this level.</p><p>YARDENI: Absolutely.  The good news is 93 percent of the labor force would still be employed, still maybe enjoying 6, 6.5 percent mortgage rates.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>YARDENI: It's not all bad news.  We will come out of this recession, but I don't think it's over yet.</p><p>DOBBS: What about these rates in terms of the consumer?  Because as you said, the consumer has stayed through this.  But we have not seen much of a ratchet down at all in consumer rates, that is specifically credit card rates.  The 10-year note has been tenacious, which is the benchmark for most 30-year mortgages.  Where does the consumer get a break here?</p><p>YARDENI: Well, so far, it's been all in the mortgage market. They've been able to refinance several times.  They've taken out some equities.  You know, housing's benefited dramatically from that, thank goodness.</p><p>But I think, you know, if we do see the unemployment rate going higher, and I think it's all a bit inevitable, there are going to be some consumer credit card problems.  And some of the stocks have already reflected that.</p><p>DOBBS: Your council in terms of these markets?  What do you see happening over the next year?</p><p>YARDENI: Well, I think preserving your capital is not a bad idea.  I think there's going to be lots of opportunities.  I know the market's been extremely strong, but I think the market's going to be surprised by the weakness in the first quarter.  So I think they'll be better opportunities down the road.</p><p>DOBBS: And alternative areas for investment, specifically real estate?</p><p>YARDENI: I think real estate's a good one.  After the bursting of Nasdaq bubble, more and more people felt their house is a good place to put more money.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, Ed Yardeni, good to have you here.</p><p>YARDENI: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up next, heated arguments today on Capitol Hill about the distribution of charity funds for victims and the families of those victims of September 11.  And taking the brunt of the criticism, the outgoing president of the Red Cross.  She is our guest here right after this break.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Next, Lou talks with Bernadine Healy.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Overwhelming generosity has turned into, in many cases, overwhelming frustration for many of us since September 11.  At issue, the slow process of distributing the billion dollars of funds donated to the families of victims.  The problem tackled on Capitol Hill today.</p><p>Peter Viles has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The soon-to-be ex- president of the American Red Cross comforting a September 11 widow on Capitol Hill.  But soon, she faced a barrage of criticism that the 9/11 charities are a mass of red tape and confusion.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why then haven't these charities been able to get together and agree on one uniform application?  Why haven't they been able to get together and develop a quicker way for families to receive these funds? We all have the missing persons reports, death certificates, and any other proof needed to avoid fraud, but the charities are not sharing these documents and information with each other.</p><p>VILES: Healy was hammered for the Red Cross' decision to put aside nearly half the money it has raised for future needs, perhaps for future terrorist attacks.</p><p>ELIOT SPITZER, NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL: I see the Red Cross, which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars that was intended by the donating public to be used for the victims of September 11.  I see those funds being sequestered into long-term plans for an organization.</p><p>REP BILLY TAUZIN (R), LOUISIANA: What's at issue here is that a special fund was established for these families.  It was specially funded for this event, September 11.  And it is being closed now because we're told enough money's been raised in it.  But we're also being told, parenthetically, by the way, we're going to give two- thirds of it away to other important Red Cross needs.</p><p>VILES: Healy, who has announced her resignation effective at year's end, defended the decision.</p><p>BERNADINE HEALY, PRESIDENT, RED CROSS: The liberty fund is a war fund.  It has evolved into a war fund.  We must have blood readiness. We must have the ability to help our troops if we go into a ground war.  We must have the ability to be there for the victims of tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: A contentious hearing.  And it continues at this hour on Capitol Hill.  The subcommittee asking the Red Cross to submit a more detailed account of how it intends to spend the money raised since September 11, also asking for verbatim accounts of any advertisements the Red Cross ran either on television and newspapers, trying to get at the issue of what was the donor intent?  Exactly what did the Red Cross ask for because the committee feels the donor intent was clearly that the money should go directly to the victims -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And Peter, your sense of the satisfaction on the part of the committee today with the answers they received?</p><p>VILES: Well, they do want some more follow-up.  They want some more information from the Red Cross. And as I said, the hearing continues at this hour.  We should say there is another hearing before another subcommittee on the same topic two days from now.  So clear to me, in any event, that Congress is not through with this issue, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: OK.  Peter Viles from Washington.  Thank you.</p><p>Well joining us now is Dr. Bernadine Healy.  She is the outgoing president of the American Red Cross and joins us now from our studios in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Dr. Healy, thanks for being here.</p><p>It looks like you had a rather tough day before the House panel. Is it your sense that the problems that have arisen can be easily remedied by the Red Cross at this point?</p><p>BERNADINE HEALY, PRESIDENT, RED CROSS: Well, I think that it's a question of what the Red Cross is.  We are congressionally chartered. We are a service organization.  We're not just an organization that funnels money to other organizations.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>HEALY: We have been working in this area for 120 years.  And what we have done with these horrible, horrible terrorist attacks is gone out and said to the public that this is about the events of 9/11 and its aftermath.  This is about a broadbased American Red Cross response to the American public.  This is a national crisis.  This is not just a problem for New York or just a problem in Pennsylvania. This is the nation at war, in a way.</p><p>DOBBS: Dr. Healy, no question that all of that is true.  But it is also true, is it not, that you were on the air on this network and others, talking specifically and appealing for money into this fund specifically targeted the victims' families of September 11.  Can you\u2026</p><p>HEALY: No, we didn't do that.  I mean and certainly\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: You did not?</p><p>HEALY: \u2026 in almost all of my appearances, I always say we have a broad range of responsibilities, which include, first and foremost, the victims.  It includes a strategic blood reserve.  We can't be stuck without vaccines or Cipro, And we can't be stuck without blood with the next attack.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>HEALY: We've extended our programs to the anthrax victims.  We also absolutely have to prepare America for weapons of mass destruction.  All of this has been outlined.  It has been articulated, voted on by our full board.  We've had full paged ads showing the whole range of issues that we are raising money for.  And of course, it's first and foremost for the victims.  We felt we needed $200 million dollars for those victims.  We raised it.</p><p>DOBBS: Dr. Healy.</p><p>HEALY: We will continue to raise money for other issues that we have to respond to.</p><p>DOBBS: Forgive me, the Liberty Fund that you put together.</p><p>HEALY: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: It was created, though, without the board's approval, was it not?</p><p>HEALY: Well initially, I didn't realize to set money aside and segregate it and put it under the close scrutiny of auditors, so that it would not be mixed in with other funds was an issue.  Once we discussed it, they voted for it.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>HEALY: The more important issue is, they supported from the very beginning the range of important uses the Red Cross has to have for the money it raises.</p><p>DOBBS: Certainly.  And everyone, I think, is both appreciative and respectful of the Red Cross for all of the good that it does. Why did you create a separate fund called the Liberty Fund?</p><p>HEALY: Well, because our existing disaster fund focuses on hurricanes and floods.  It is a general disaster fund that's used for many other purposes, for 60,000 disasters all over the country.  This was a different kind of disaster.</p><p>Lou, we have not seen anything like it since the world wars.  We felt it had to be segregated, because this was not just a fire in North Carolina.  This was about the whole nation who was being attacked.</p><p>DOBBS: For many of the people\u2026</p><p>HEALY: A new kind of war.</p><p>DOBBS: Dr., you'll excuse me.</p><p>HEALY: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: For many people who were sending in their money, and we have heard from, I mean, I'm sure you have, people extraordinarily frustrated because for them it was about the victims and the families of the victims of September 11.</p><p>May I quote to you and get your reaction to it, because this to me is a remarkable statement from the president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, Daniel Borochoff.  He says, \"The Red Cross overdid it and acted opportunistically, raising money for other programs that were not on the minds of the donors when they gave them the money.\" How do you respond to that?</p><p>HEALY: Oh, we you know, we went out there and worked day and night for an attack on this nation that no one could have anticipated. We planned for a weapon, a mass destruction attack.  We knew our obligations under the congressional charter.  We knew it involved victim assistance and sheltering. We knew that it involved dealing with the rescue workers.  We knew that it involved blood.  We knew that it involved training the rest of the country, communities everywhere, that they can know about weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>We've disseminated material on anthrax.  We've disseminated material on training for weapons of mass destruction.  This is the broadbased role of the American Red Cross.  We have been working night and day.  We have tried to get that message out.  We have done it in numerous communications and PSA's in full page ads in newspapers, the major newspapers all over country just because, Lou, there is a blot of background noise that says, and many other charities are saying, that this is only for the victims in New York.</p><p>That is not what we ever said.  Of course those victims in New York were our first priority. And we've set aside $200 million, which I think is more than any other program.  $150 million has basically been spent on those victims.  Lou, I don't know that anyone else has poured that much money out into the hands of the victims.</p><p>But we have other obligations to this country, to you, Lou, to communities all over America.  This is still an ongoing terrorist threat.  We have uncertainty.  And we have obligations under our charter to serve there. And I'm so sorry that there seems to be confusion about this.</p><p>DOBBS: OK.  I think that we're all sorry that this -- because everyone is well intended, and also at the same time frustrated.  But what I asked was, how do you feel about Daniel Borochoff's statement, saying that the Red Cross overdid and acted opportunistically?</p><p>HEALY: When an event goes out, you go and do the best job you can.  And you hope that people respond by investing in the jobs that you're trying to do.  And I think that's what happened here.  You know, when we first started, we didn't think that we would be able to raise $200 or 250 million.  We were astounded at how much we raised as well.  And all the more reason to keep that segregated in a separate Liberty Fund, so it's not used for anything else.  It is there for the events of 9/11, the aftermath, and future terrorist events.</p><p>DOBBS: Has the Red Cross and its management learned something?</p><p>HEALY: Well, I think that what you always have to do is make sure that you communicate, communicate, communicate.  And I mean take out ads every single day to say to the public, \"This is what the Red Cross is doing.  Don't confuse us with the 9/11 Fund in New York. Don't confuse us with Habitat for Humanity.  Don't confuse us with a scholarship fund in New York for the victims.\" This is what the Red Cross does.  We have to get that out.</p><p>DOBBS: You said communicate, communicate.  Has the Red Cross learned anything about listen, listen, listen?</p><p>HEALY: Oh, absolutely.  We must listen to the people we serve. We must listen to those firefighters.  We must listen to those kids in Chicago, Illinois, who were worried that their city may be at risk. We must listen to the hospital systems that are now saying we don't have enough Cipro and we may not have vaccines.  We must listen to the fact that we have an obligation to prepare this country.  Of course, we must listen.</p><p>DOBBS: And to daughters\u2026</p><p>HEALY: Especially to those we serve.  We always listen.  In fact, Lou, many of the donors came in and gave money just for the strategic blood reserve or just for international.  We had a lot of international money that came in.</p><p>DOBBS: Dr. Healy\u2026</p><p>HEALY: We always listen to the donors.</p><p>DOBBS: Excellent.  And we appreciate your taking the time to be with us here tonight.</p><p>HEALY: Thank you so much.</p><p>DOBBS: Dr. Bernadine Healy, the outgoing president of the Red Cross.</p><p>Coming up next, we'll have your thoughts and we'll take a look at what's in store for tomorrow.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: A struggling decision by the leaders of major league baseball.  The baseball owners have agreed to eliminate two teams possibly as soon as next season.  Baseball commissioner Bud Selig tonight saying the reason for the cut is a number of franchises are simply not bringing in enough money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUD SELIG, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL COMMISSIONER: It just shows you how committed we are to solving our problems.  And therefore, when we made an analysis of the clubs and their ability to generate revenue and the ability to survive because of that generation of revenue, I think that shows a willingness on our part to do the things that we have to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Even though Selig didn't say which teams would be dropped, the teams most often mentioned are the Montreal Expos, the Minnesota Twins, and the Florida Marlins.</p><p>\"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\" begins in just a few moments.  Let's go to Wolf now for a preview from Washington.  Wolf?</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, HOST, \"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\": Thank you, Lou. We'll have details of President Bush's latest warning about Osama bin Laden and weapons of mass destruction. Is bin Laden trying to get nuclear weapons?  We'll ask our panel, former CIA director James Woolsey, Senator Paul Wellstone and former CIA case officer Ru Algerecht (ph).  Also, the latest on the war front.  That and much more -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Wolf, thanks so much.</p><p>Coming up next here we'll have your thoughts on interest rates and we'll take a look at tomorrow.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Tomorrow, a look at the nation's productivity. For the third quarter, economists are expecting an increase of two percent. Quarterly results are due from Waste Management and Aetna, amongst others.  And please join us tomorrow night when the special representative to Washington for the Northern Alliance, Harun Amin, will be our guest here.</p><p>The Fed's interest rate cut today for the tenth time this year, setting some records.  Let's take a look at some of your thoughts on that issue.</p><p>Dave in Roseville, California saying job security is the key to economic health.  And he writes, \"We're in a downward economic spiral until we have assurance our jobs are secure.  It would be irresponsible to keep spending with so much economic uncertainty, especially employment.\"</p><p>And from P. Lerro, \"The half point rate reduction today indicates the Fed is panicky and that things are worse than we thought.  The Fed may think we will be in a deflationary spiral soon.  Otherwise, how could they institute a half point cut now?\" Well, it's pretty much what most economists wanted them to do.</p><p>Andrew Russell says that no matter what happens to the direction of interest rates, the best hope for the economy, the consumer, that is the consumer will still be the one who loses out.  He writes, \"Now that the Fed has cut rates to the lowest in 40 years, should Congress protect the consumer from the credit card companies that charge high interest rates?\"</p><p>As always, we want to hear your thoughts. Please e-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyline@cnn.com\">moneyline@cnn.com</email>.  </p><p>For this Tuesday evening, that's MONEYLINE. Thanks for being with us. I'm Lou Dobbs.

The Nasdaq had also climbed above 12,000 points for the first time in history Wednesday. Around midday, all three major indexes had bounced back from their morning lows but remained sharply in the red. The Dow was off by 1.7%, or more than 500 points, and the S&amp;P down 2.4%. So, what's happening? For one, the the other two major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow (INDU) and the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) \u2014 for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit. Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 30% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. \"Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments. But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs. \"The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,\" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. Stocks in cyclical sectors are also expected to perform better as the economy is recovering. The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether. Given the summer rally, it's \"perfectly normal,\" to see tech stocks readjusting a bit, Detrick said. And even investors who are still faithful to their safe tech holdings have reason to be a little concerned: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, told CNN Thursday that a Covid-19 vaccine by October remained \"unlikely,\" though it was possible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42991784115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RW-YMG1-F07F-81NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"446\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000858D</classCode><className>LPL FINANCIAL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC6289 SERVICES ALLIED WITH THE EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES OR COMMODITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, Facebook arranged to share user data with 150 companies in an attempt to get more users while thwarting the platform's own privacy rules. Amazon got users' names and contact information through friend networks, and Netflix and Spotify had the ability to read Facebook users' private messages. The Senate Intelligence Committee is set to release two reports on Monday detailing the breadth of the Russian social media campaign to sow discord in the United States. The reports are based on troves of data that Facebook, Twitter, and Google handed over to the committee about the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election and American politics generally. A cybersecurity firm says hackers were able to infiltrate a European Union communications system for years and copy thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables, The New York Times has reported. Area 1, the cybersecurity firm which discovered the vulnerability, said thousands of E.U. diplomatic cables were accessed using techniques resembling those long used by an elite unit of China's People's Liberation Army.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[07:30:44] ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: World markets, as you can see there, mixed this morning. U.S. stocks appear to be set for a solid opening. A rally, though, fizzled yesterday as Dow and S&amp;P 500 remain on pace for their worst December since 1931 which, of course, was in the middle of the Great Depression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So you may be wondering what's going on. Joining us now is CNN political commentator Catherine Rampell who is a \"Washington Post\" opinion columnist. And, CNN senior economics analyst Stephen Moore, who was also an economic adviser to the Trump campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we look at all of this, let's just pull back for a minute because there is a lot of up and down, as we know, in the markets and you're told all the time by financial advisers -- whether it's the people you call on the phone or if you have someone you talk to about your money regularly -- don't look at this on a day-to-day basis. Don't go and look at your 401K.</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMICS ANALYST, DISTINGUISHED FELLOW, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION, FORMER TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISER: Yes.</p><p>HILL: But, Catherine, as people at home are looking at this it's hard not to look at the headlines every day and say whoa, what's really going on with this market.</p><p>How concerned should people be?</p><p>CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, OPINION COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, a lot of the slide in the market recently, or at least the whipsawing, has to do with recent policy uncertainty, right, about the trade war, news that we do or don't have a deal with China.</p><p>There's other uncertainty, of course, about the Affordable Care Act because a judge struck it down as unconstitutional last Friday. So we saw a big decline in health-related stocks on Monday.</p><p>So some of this has to do with recent policy uncertainty which may or may not get resolved. Some of it has to do with potentially actual weaknesses in our economy, right, if you look at housing, for example, or you look at other signs that there might be some lurking risks in the economy, like the inverted yield curve.</p><p>But there doesn't seem to be an indication that we are like on the verge of a recession if you look at forecasts.</p><p>For example, \"The Wall Street Journal\" surveyed a bunch of economists and they said -- more than half of them said they are expecting a recession by 2020. It does seem like there might be a recession sometime in the next few years.</p><p>But, you know, if you're worried about the stock market, if you're worried about the economy, I do not recommend looking at the day-to- day fluctuations, although they are a little bit telling about what risks may lie in store.</p><p>HILL: I hear you laughing, Stephen. Is that in agreement or is it --</p><p>MOORE: Yes, I'm going to jump around that one. My wife -- my wife is guilty of it. She -- every night she calls me. Oh, honey, we lost $5,000 today or we gained $3,000 or $5,000 the next day.</p><p>I agree with that. Look, especially, by the way, if you're a long- term investor. If you've got your money in a retirement account or even if it's a three- or five- or 10-year investment, you don't want to look at these daily changes in the stock market. It's only going to make you seasick.</p><p>Look, I think that the economy is still very fundamentally strong. And, in fact, it's really interesting -- I've been studying this stuff for 25 years. I've very rarely seen such a divergence in terms of where the real economy is, which is extremely positive still.</p><p>Yes, I mean, we've come down from these incredible highs we had six months ago. But manufacturing is strong, construction is strong, industrial production is strong. Consumer confidence is still near its 30- or 40-year high. And yet, the stock market keeps falling.</p><p>RAMPELL: But --</p><p>MOORE: I agree -- I agree with Catherine --</p><p>RAMPELL: There are some --</p><p>MOORE: -- and I think the main --</p><p>RAMPELL: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: -- point is this China trade war. But I'm actually somewhat optimistic that in the next 60 or 70 days we are going to get a deal. And if that happens, the stock market goes through the roof.</p><p>HILL: Alan Greenspan, speaking with CNN's Julia Chatterley yesterday, said basically prepare first. I just want to play a little bit of what he had to say.</p><p>MOORE: OK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE WITH JULIA CHATTERLEY\": Do you think we're still in a bull market -- an equity bull market?</p><p>ALAN GREENSPAN, FORMER CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD: Not really, no. It's beginning to fumble. You can see it by the reaction in recent days.</p><p>It would be very surprising to see it sort of stabilize yet and take off again, but it's happened in the past. However, at the end of that run, run for cover.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: And, Stephen, your point, I think, with China could change things. Then you hear Alan Greenspan saying even if this happens, at the end of it --</p><p>MOORE: I think it could.</p><p>HILL: -- run for cover. Those are sobering words.</p><p>MOORE: They sure are. I mean, look, Alan Greenspan's a smart guy, you know. He ran the Federal Reserve, obviously. He did a -- he did a pretty darn good job at the Fed for -- I think he was there over a decade.</p><p>But, you know, he's not an oracle. None of these people at the Fed are.</p><p>I'm going to stick with my prediction that I'd put it maybe better than 50-50 odds that as we get close to that 90-day deadline that Trump set in Buenos Aires with President Xi to get some kind of concessions from China -- if that happens I think you're going to see some real jubilation in the stock market.</p><p>[07:35:15] Look, I think President Trump has really almost staked his presidency on getting this deal done. And it's all, right now -- the ball is in -- it's hard to predict because the ball is in Beijing's court whether they're going to come forward.</p><p>And by the way, last week we saw what a -- what a, you know, bad actor China is on the international scene with the hacking of American companies. They're stealing our technologies.</p><p>This is a fight Trump has to win. It's a Trump -- it's a fight, frankly, America has to win.</p><p>HILL: I want to look at another fight that's coming up or the president seems to be picking with his own Fed chair, Jerome Powell. So we know, too -- we're waiting today, obviously, for a possible Fed rate hike.</p><p>Catherine, we look at this, though -- these unprecedented attacks on the Fed. What's the overall implication there? What's the lasting impact? RAMPELL: I think the lasting impact of this is very dangerous, is how I would put it.</p><p>So, essentially, the Fed has worked over the decades -- this is a multi-decade-long project to establish credibility to show that they are politically independent. That they are now swayed by the day-to- day considerations, politics of the next upcoming election, and that is critically important for price stability and for growth.</p><p>I mean, if you want to look at a useful counterexample, look at places like Venezuela or Argentina or pre-Euro Italy or other places where politicians got control of the printing press.</p><p>So it is critically important for the Fed to both maintain its political independence and the perception of political independence.</p><p>And when Trump starts browbeating them and saying I think that they should keep rates low because we want to juice growth a little bit more, that threatens the Fed's credibility and could actually backfire if you're looking at what Trump's ultimate objective is because the Fed might say look, we don't want to look like we're caving to political pressure. Maybe we should err on the side of raising rates if there's some ambiguity about whether we should or whether we shouldn't.</p><p>So they may decide that --</p><p>MOORE: That may --</p><p>RAMPELL: -- if -- that if Trump is going to publicly browbeat them and try to arm-twist them -- which again, goes against decades of precedent for what presidential administrations do -- they may say we need to assure markets that we are politically independent and we're going to raise rates.</p><p>MOORE: Well --</p><p>RAMPELL: I don't know that they're going to do that, but that could certainly be an outcome.</p><p>MOORE: Well, let me -- let me respond to that.</p><p>HILL: Real quickly, Stephen.</p><p>MOORE: Look, the fact is that three months ago Donald Trump criticized, very severely, the Fed decision to raise rates, and it turns out Donald Trump was exactly right. That, in fact, since then the stock market has been on a long-term -- we've lost 10 percent value.</p><p>And the economy -- you know, there's a deflation now. I mean, you look at what's happened to the oil price, you look at --</p><p>RAMPELL: But that's because of his trade war. I mean --</p><p>MOORE: -- the price of copper and cotton and so on. RAMPELL: But, you know -- but you said -- you just said --</p><p>MOORE: And so, I'm -- look, my only point is this. Catherine --</p><p>RAMPELL: You just said that the economy is fundamentally strong.</p><p>MOORE: Let me just make this point.</p><p>RAMPELL: You can't have it both ways.</p><p>MOORE: It is strong.</p><p>RAMPELL: Either the economy is fundamentally strong --</p><p>MOORE: No, I --</p><p>RAMPELL: -- which justifies raising rates.</p><p>MOORE: The economy --</p><p>RAMPELL: Or it's fundamentally weak --</p><p>MOORE: Catherine, let me -- let me finish my point.</p><p>RAMPELL: -- which suggests a pause.</p><p>MOORE: The -- no, no, no, no. The economy is strong. The problem that we face in the future is a deflation because of these raising of interest rates.</p><p>I want the Fed to set a stable --</p><p>RAMPELL: What?</p><p>MOORE: -- price system. We don't have stable prices now. Catherine, we have deflation.</p><p>Look at what's happened with the -- you know, we've got a 10 percent decline in corn prices, soybean prices, cotton prices. But that -- yes -- no, there was a deflation on --</p><p>RAMPELL: We don't -- we don't have deflation right now. You can look at the CPI. There is not deflation right now.</p><p>HILL: One thing that we do have, though -- we do have a time limit, so I'm going to have to cut you both off there.</p><p>MOORE: Oh, damn.</p><p>HILL: The good news is you know we'll bring you back again and we're not done with this topic.</p><p>Stephen, Catherine, appreciate it.</p><p>MOORE: OK.</p><p>HILL: Thank you, both.</p><p>RAMPELL: Thank you.</p><p>HILL: John --</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: I'm going to use that. We have a time limit -- all right.</p><p>Who is Facebook sharing your personal data with? \"The New York Times\" report -- you know, the headline is this -- your private messages may not be so private. That's next.</p><p>[07:42:47] HILL: This morning, Facebook is facing another stunning privacy scandal. And, yes, we're talking about your information. \"The New York Times\" reported the social media giant gave more than 150 partner companies intrusive access to users' personal data -- something that went on for years.</p><p>CNN's Brian Stelter joins us live to help explain.</p><p>So, first of all, these internal documents here that we do have, what do they reveal about the information that Facebook was sharing with these partner companies?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, \"RELIABLE SOURCES\": Yes, there was a wide variety of private information being shared with these trusted partners.

And, \"The New York Times\" which broke this story, also had access years ago -- access to friend lists.</p><p>Now these companies, like Spotify and Netflix, they say they did not abuse this access. In many cases, they say they never even looked at all.</p><p>The point, though, is that Facebook left the door open. They left the door open for this access --</p><p>HILL: Right.</p><p>STELTER: -- and that seems very worrisome.</p><p>HILL: Well, also, I mean, there are -- there are so many sort of layers to this, too. Although you may -- you may not have done it but if you knew you could do it should you have raised a red flag? That's a separate issue there. There is the range of information, as you pointed out there. The ability to delete people's messages -- messages they thought were private.</p><p>Facebook is obviously responding. Are they shedding much light on this?</p><p>STELTER: Well, the company is saying what it's said, frankly, all year long, which is we need to do better, we've got problems.</p><p>Here's a part of the statement from one of the company's representatives, saying, \"We know we've got work to do to regain people's trust. Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that's what we've been focused on for most of 2018.\"</p><p>And look, Facebook has been under scrutiny all year long about these issues for a number of reasons. There's this tension baked into the platform.</p><p>Facebook is where I go to find out about my friends' and families' lives, their health concerns, their babies, their plans. And yet, Facebook also profits from all that data and works with all these other companies. And the headline from \"The New York Times\" overnight is that all these other companies also were able to be in that relationship and unbeknownst to users.</p><p>[07:45:06] Now, technically, if you click the box -- if you hit OK, you might -- you might -- Facebook might say you've given permission.</p><p>HILL: Right.</p><p>STELTER: You've allowed it. But I don't think users actually know what's going on.</p><p>So there's two questions this morning. One, did Facebook violate its 2012 agreement with the FTC -- its consent decree? The company says it didn't; others say it may have.</p><p>And number two, what are regulators going to do now? What is Washington going to do now to provide more oversight for these big companies?</p><p>HILL: And question three -- and I think a lot of people at home have, too -- is any of this still going on --</p><p>STELTER: It's still going on.</p><p>HILL: -- and who may still have access, if anyone? What are they doing with that?</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>HILL: A lot of questions, not always a lot of answers. We get them from you, though. So, Brian, we appreciate that.</p><p>STELTER: Well, thanks.</p><p>HILL: Thank you -- John.</p><p>BERMAN: All right.</p><p>Those Russian social media ads and posts designed to influence our election, they seem silly and almost obvious now. So why were they so effective and what does that say about our deeply divided society?</p><p>Senior political analyst John Avlon has your reality check -- sir.</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: That's right.</p><p>So, the pair of new studies commissioned by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee first found that Russia's social media messaging ahead of the election, quote, \"Clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party and specifically, Donald Trump, as early as the GOP primaries.\" And not to mention, of course, all of the requisite hitting on Hillary.</p><p>But what's really stunning is how Russia's efforts to spread misinformation over social media preyed on America's identity politics divides. They targeted tribes on the far-right and far-left. And to look through their characters of identity politics is to see how easily duped we are by dividers.</p><p>For example, Russian trolls targeted memes to the religious right in the name of the so-called Army of Jesus and their appeals were not exactly biblically-based.</p><p>Here's a picture of Jesus arm-wrestling the devil as a proxy war for Clinton versus Trump. Or this meme showing Trump and Pence as the Jesus team and Hillary and her running mate, Tim Kaine, as the Satan team. There's even an image of Jesus wearing a MAGA hat.</p><p>And if you liked these you were duped by the Russians.</p><p>On the left, Russian trolls also targeted an African-American activist community, pretending to care about Black Lives Matter and victims of police violence on the prolific Blacktivist page. At the same time, Russian trolls were pumping up the so-called Blue Lives Matter movement, showing police funerals and blaming them on Black Lives Matter activists.</p><p>Supposedly, patriotic gun rights memes were created and promoted by Russian trolls, like this image declaring that, quote, \"The 2nd Amendment Is My Gun Permit\" -- as well as LGBT pages like this adult coloring book offering a look at a quote-unquote \"Buff Bernie\" which we did not need to see.</p><p>There were anti-immigrant memes that echoed Trump's fearmongering about illegal immigrants voting. And pages that celebrated the Confederate flag as heritage, not hate, and promoted Texas secession as the next step after Brexit.</p><p>There were memes that mocked politically correct culture and concerns about white supremacy and also attacking John McCain.</p><p>Perhaps most sinister was when all of this fakeness aligned to attack real journalism, from fake George Orwell quotes to memes that compared North Korean propaganda to real news.</p><p>Now, if all this is enough to give you whiplash, that was part of the point. The goal of this kind of disinformation is to confuse, divide, and distract -- to create anger and apathy, sometimes with the specific goal of driving down election turnout, such as this meme aimed at the African-American community or promoting the Green Party candidacy of Jill Stein, who received more votes in key swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania than Trump's victory margin.</p><p>In all, 10.4 million tweets, 116,000 Instagram posts, 61,000 Facebook posts, and 1,100 YouTube videos.</p><p>But on the most fundamental level, the Russian trolls understood that our identity politics divides, the kind that focus on common enemies rather than our common humanity, is the real source of weakness in our society and they exploited it with unwitting Americans' help.</p><p>Now, there's a phrase used by the mass murdering founder of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin, that applies to folks who liked and shared these links -- \"useful idiots.\"</p><p>And that's your reality check.</p><p>BERMAN: Sobering, and I'm not just talking about like the muscular workout Bernie Sanders. The whole thing is sobering.</p><p>HILL: Yes, the whole thing is.</p><p>AVLON: It's surreal and sobering.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, John. Thanks very much.</p><p>HILL: Hacked cables revealing how the international community really feels about President Trump, Iran, and Russia. \"The New York Times\" reporter who broke this story joins us, next.</p><p>[07:53:24] HILL: \"The New York Times\" has obtained more than 1,000 hacked European diplomatic cables. Those cables reveal the international community's serious concerns about President Trump, Russia, Iran, and more.</p><p>Let's discuss with the reporter who broke the story, national security correspondent for \"The New York Times\" and CNN political and national security analyst, David Sanger.</p><p>David, good to have you with us, as always.</p><p>Give us a sense as we look at these. James Clapper was with us a little bit earlier and he said this certainly doesn't rise to the level of WikiLeaks in terms of the information that is now out here. But still, it's significant that somebody thought it important enough to steal it, post it somewhere to be found, and then have those folks share it with you.</p><p>DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Well, Erica, I think that's right. I think Gen. Clapper is correct. This is not on the scale of WikiLeaks, which was 250,000 U.S. cables. And, frankly, Americans cared more about those cables because they were American in origin and I think did reveal a bit more.</p><p>In this case, the hackers who followed all the patterns of a Chinese People's Liberation Army group -- I don't think intended for any of these to become public.</p><p>They did a sort of traditional phishing campaign against the European Union. They got in through Cypress, a small and less well-defended member of the E.U. And then, used that access to get all of the documents that -- appear to have gotten all of the documents that are exchanged daily among European diplomats through the E.U.'s main network.</p><p>[07:55:00] In doing so, they briefly passed through some public sites on their way up to the cloud, and it was there that a company called Area 1 found them and turned about 1,000 of them over -- a little more than 1,000 of them over to us.</p><p>What they reveal, as you suggest, is that the diplomats get assurances from the National Security Council that President Trump didn't mean exactly what he said when he spoke with Vladimir Putin at that famous Helsinki press conference.</p><p>They worry that the Russians have already put nuclear weapons into Crimea. They are concerned that Iran will use the excuse of the U.S. coming out of the nuclear deal to restart their nuclear program.</p><p>HILL: They also, too, were looking at even just a cable that refers to a July meeting with E.U. officials and Xi Jinping talking about U.S. demands -- both U.S. -- what we're hearing from the U.S. and U.S. demands are inconsistent.</p><p>When that's the message that's going out which isn't shocking, perhaps, to a lot of people who have been following the headlines, obviously -- but does having this out there do any damage to relationships with these countries?</p><p>SANGER: You know, at this point, given the state of relations between the European Union and the United States, I don't think so.</p><p>The cable you refer to though, Erica, I think was one of the most interesting. It was a private meeting between Xi Jinping, the president of China, and the Europeans in Beijing. It was an E.U.- China summit in which President Xi basically says the Americans never live up to their word. President Trump is bullying them.</p><p>But then he goes into this fascinating long reverie about how China, for 100 or 200 years, has bent to larger powers and in this case, now feels strong enough that it doesn't plan to go do it again. And what's interesting is that the president views this entire thing transactionally --</p><p>HILL: Yes.</p><p>SANGER: -- and Xi views it as part of a long historical continuum in which the tide has turned and China is going to make sure that it doesn't get run over again.</p><p>HILL: It certainly sets it up there, doesn't it?</p><p>As we talk about all of this -- and even just putting it into context as you did off the top -- these cables and this communication versus some of the other things that have been hacked and then leaked -- it still begs the question of what's the conversation like at \"The New York Times\" when Area 1 comes to you and say we have 1,000 cables that we found that someone hacked. We want you to have them. We think you should publish them.</p><p>How is that decision made because there's still people at home who are going to say why should we see these?</p><p>SANGER: You know, that's a very good question and we debated this at some length, and here was the reasoning.</p><p>First of all, these were posted in an open site. It's not as if we got them through a hacking process or that Area 1 did, as well. The Chinese, in moving them -- or whoever the hackers were, though they certainly appear to be China-based -- did that.</p><p>Secondly, there were no big national secrets here. There were no nuclear codes. These were at the restricted level and confidential level. They were not top-secret documents.</p><p>And thirdly, as we looked at it they sort of gave a backstory, one that you would frequently get in background conversations with European officials and others, to their interchanges with the president, with the Chinese, with the Iranians. And it just sort of confirmed how they're talking to each other on it.</p><p>There were no great privacy revelations here, Erica. These weren't -- these didn't get into personally private data in any way. They were the kind of discussions you would get in a background candid conversation if you sat down with a European official.</p><p>HILL: They also, which I know you've pointed out and which James Clapper also did point out as well this morning -- they also pinpoint the fact that people have been concerned about the communications systems within the E.U. for some time and there's a question about what this could lead to in terms of changes.</p><p>David, we're out of time.</p><p>SANGER: Absolutely.</p><p>HILL: You're always appreciated. Thank you. SANGER: Thank you.</p><p>HILL: Michael Flynn's legal journey is far from over. NEW DAY continues right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The FBI broke standard protocol in the way that they came in and ambushed Gen. Flynn.</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI: I'm very proud of the way the FBI conducted itself.</p><p>EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: This judge repeatedly went back to Flynn to make him say that he was, indeed, guilty.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He stepped in front of a judge and said nope, I lied and I intended to. None of this makes sense to me.</p><p>KEN STARR, FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL: We have a rule of law country. We saw that with checks and balances of Judge Sullivan.</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D), NEW YORK: Jared Kushner was authentically serious about trying to get something done to reform our broken criminal justice system.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Formerly incarcerated people, directly impacted people refuse to die on this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To see bipartisan legislation out of Washington these days is force of revelation. Who knew it could happen?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is NEW DAY with Alisyn Camerota and John Berman.</p><p>BERMAN: Good morning. Welcome to your NEW DAY. It is Wednesday, December --</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

U.S. stocks appear to be set for a solid opening.  A rally, though, fizzled yesterday as Dow and S&amp;P 500 remain on pace for their worst December since 1931 which, of course, was in the middle of the Great Depression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So you may be wondering what's going on.  Joining us now is CNN political commentator Catherine Rampell who is a \"Washington Post\" opinion columnist.  And, CNN senior economics analyst Stephen Moore, who was also an economic adviser to the Trump campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we look at all of this, let's just pull back for a minute because there is a lot of up and down, as we know, in the markets and you're told all the time by financial advisers -- whether it's the people you call on the phone or if you have someone you talk to about your money regularly -- don't look at this on a day-to-day basis.  Don't go and look at your 401K.</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMICS ANALYST, DISTINGUISHED FELLOW, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION, FORMER TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISER:  Yes.</p><p>HILL:  But, Catherine, as people at home are looking at this it's hard not to look at the headlines every day and say whoa, what's really going on with this market.</p><p>How concerned should people be?</p><p>CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, OPINION COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST:  Well, a lot of the slide in the market recently, or at least the whipsawing, has to do with recent policy uncertainty, right, about the trade war, news that we do or don't have a deal with China.  </p><p>There's other uncertainty, of course, about the Affordable Care Act because a judge struck it down as unconstitutional last Friday.  So we saw a big decline in health-related stocks on Monday.</p><p>So some of this has to do with recent policy uncertainty which may or may not get resolved.  Some of it has to do with potentially actual weaknesses in our economy, right, if you look at housing, for example, or you look at other signs that there might be some lurking risks in the economy, like the inverted yield curve.</p><p>But there doesn't seem to be an indication that we are like on the verge of a recession if you look at forecasts.</p><p>For example, \"The Wall Street Journal\" surveyed a bunch of economists and they said -- more than half of them said they are expecting a recession by 2020.  It does seem like there might be a recession sometime in the next few years.  </p><p>But, you know, if you're worried about the stock market, if you're worried about the economy, I do not recommend looking at the day-to- day fluctuations, although they are a little bit telling about what risks may lie in store.</p><p>HILL:  I hear you laughing, Stephen.  Is that in agreement or is it --</p><p>MOORE:  Yes, I'm going to jump around that one.  My wife -- my wife is guilty of it.  She -- every night she calls me.  Oh, honey, we lost $5,000 today or we gained $3,000 or $5,000 the next day.</p><p>I agree with that.  Look, especially, by the way, if you're a long- term investor.  If you've got your money in a retirement account or even if it's a three- or five- or 10-year investment, you don't want to look at these daily changes in the stock market.  It's only going to make you seasick.</p><p>Look, I think that the economy is still very fundamentally strong. And, in fact, it's really interesting -- I've been studying this stuff for 25 years.  I've very rarely seen such a divergence in terms of where the real economy is, which is extremely positive still.  </p><p>Yes, I mean, we've come down from these incredible highs we had six months ago.  But manufacturing is strong, construction is strong, industrial production is strong.  Consumer confidence is still near its 30- or 40-year high.  And yet, the stock market keeps falling.</p><p>RAMPELL:  But --</p><p>MOORE:  I agree -- I agree with Catherine --</p><p>RAMPELL:  There are some --</p><p>MOORE:  -- and I think the main --</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.</p><p>MOORE:  -- point is this China trade war.  But I'm actually somewhat optimistic that in the next 60 or 70 days we are going to get a deal. And if that happens, the stock market goes through the roof.</p><p>HILL:  Alan Greenspan, speaking with CNN's Julia Chatterley yesterday, said basically prepare first.  I just want to play a little bit of what he had to say.</p><p>MOORE:  OK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE WITH JULIA CHATTERLEY\":  Do you think we're still in a bull market -- an equity bull market?</p><p>ALAN GREENSPAN, FORMER CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD:  Not really, no.  It's beginning to fumble.  You can see it by the reaction in recent days.  </p><p>It would be very surprising to see it sort of stabilize yet and take off again, but it's happened in the past.  However, at the end of that run, run for cover.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL:  And, Stephen, your point, I think, with China could change things.  Then you hear Alan Greenspan saying even if this happens, at the end of it --</p><p>MOORE:  I think it could.</p><p>HILL:  -- run for cover.  Those are sobering words.</p><p>MOORE:  They sure are.  I mean, look, Alan Greenspan's a smart guy, you know.  He ran the Federal Reserve, obviously.  He did a -- he did a pretty darn good job at the Fed for -- I think he was there over a decade.</p><p>But, you know, he's not an oracle.  None of these people at the Fed are.  </p><p>I'm going to stick with my prediction that I'd put it maybe better than 50-50 odds that as we get close to that 90-day deadline that Trump set in Buenos Aires with President Xi to get some kind of concessions from China -- if that happens I think you're going to see some real jubilation in the stock market.</p><p>[07:35:15]  Look, I think President Trump has really almost staked his presidency on getting this deal done.  And it's all, right now -- the ball is in -- it's hard to predict because the ball is in Beijing's court whether they're going to come forward.</p><p>And by the way, last week we saw what a -- what a, you know, bad actor China is on the international scene with the hacking of American companies.  They're stealing our technologies.  </p><p>This is a fight Trump has to win.  It's a Trump -- it's a fight, frankly, America has to win.</p><p>HILL:  I want to look at another fight that's coming up or the president seems to be picking with his own Fed chair, Jerome Powell. So we know, too -- we're waiting today, obviously, for a possible Fed rate hike.</p><p>Catherine, we look at this, though -- these unprecedented attacks on the Fed.  What's the overall implication there?  What's the lasting impact? RAMPELL:  I think the lasting impact of this is very dangerous, is how I would put it.  </p><p>So, essentially, the Fed has worked over the decades -- this is a multi-decade-long project to establish credibility to show that they are politically independent.  That they are now swayed by the day-to- day considerations, politics of the next upcoming election, and that is critically important for price stability and for growth.  </p><p>I mean, if you want to look at a useful counterexample, look at places like Venezuela or Argentina or pre-Euro Italy or other places where politicians got control of the printing press.</p><p>So it is critically important for the Fed to both maintain its political independence and the perception of political independence.  </p><p>And when Trump starts browbeating them and saying I think that they should keep rates low because we want to juice growth a little bit more, that threatens the Fed's credibility and could actually backfire if you're looking at what Trump's ultimate objective is because the Fed might say look, we don't want to look like we're caving to political pressure.  Maybe we should err on the side of raising rates if there's some ambiguity about whether we should or whether we shouldn't.</p><p>So they may decide that --</p><p>MOORE:  That may --</p><p>RAMPELL:  -- if -- that if Trump is going to publicly browbeat them and try to arm-twist them -- which again, goes against decades of precedent for what presidential administrations do -- they may say we need to assure markets that we are politically independent and we're going to raise rates.</p><p>MOORE:  Well --</p><p>RAMPELL:  I don't know that they're going to do that, but that could certainly be an outcome.</p><p>MOORE:  Well, let me -- let me respond to that.</p><p>HILL:  Real quickly, Stephen.</p><p>MOORE:  Look, the fact is that three months ago Donald Trump criticized, very severely, the Fed decision to raise rates, and it turns out Donald Trump was exactly right.  That, in fact, since then the stock market has been on a long-term -- we've lost 10 percent value.  </p><p>And the economy -- you know, there's a deflation now.  I mean, you look at what's happened to the oil price, you look at --</p><p>RAMPELL:  But that's because of his trade war.  I mean --</p><p>MOORE:  -- the price of copper and cotton and so on. RAMPELL:  But, you know -- but you said -- you just said --</p><p>MOORE:  And so, I'm -- look, my only point is this.  Catherine --</p><p>RAMPELL:  You just said that the economy is fundamentally strong.</p><p>MOORE:  Let me just make this point.</p><p>RAMPELL:  You can't have it both ways.</p><p>MOORE:  It is strong.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Either the economy is fundamentally strong --</p><p>MOORE:  No, I --</p><p>RAMPELL:  -- which justifies raising rates.</p><p>MOORE:  The economy --</p><p>RAMPELL:  Or it's fundamentally weak --</p><p>MOORE:  Catherine, let me -- let me finish my point.</p><p>RAMPELL:  -- which suggests a pause.</p><p>MOORE:  The -- no, no, no, no.  The economy is strong.  The problem that we face in the future is a deflation because of these raising of interest rates.</p><p>I want the Fed to set a stable --</p><p>RAMPELL:  What?</p><p>MOORE:  -- price system.  We don't have stable prices now.  Catherine, we have deflation.  </p><p>Look at what's happened with the -- you know, we've got a 10 percent decline in corn prices, soybean prices, cotton prices.  But that -- yes -- no, there was a deflation on --</p><p>RAMPELL:  We don't -- we don't have deflation right now.  You can look at the CPI.  There is not deflation right now.</p><p>HILL:  One thing that we do have, though -- we do have a time limit, so I'm going to have to cut you both off there.</p><p>MOORE:  Oh, damn.</p><p>HILL:  The good news is you know we'll bring you back again and we're not done with this topic.</p><p>Stephen, Catherine, appreciate it.</p><p>MOORE:  OK.</p><p>HILL:  Thank you, both.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Thank you.</p><p>HILL:  John --</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  I'm going to use that.  We have a time limit -- all right.</p><p>Who is Facebook sharing your personal data with?  \"The New York Times\" report -- you know, the headline is this -- your private messages may not be so private.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[07:42:47]  HILL:  This morning, Facebook is facing another stunning privacy scandal.  And, yes, we're talking about your information. \"The New York Times\" reported the social media giant gave more than 150 partner companies intrusive access to users' personal data -- something that went on for years.</p><p>CNN's Brian Stelter joins us live to help explain.</p><p>So, first of all, these internal documents here that we do have, what do they reveal about the information that Facebook was sharing with these partner companies?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, \"RELIABLE SOURCES\":  Yes, there was a wide variety of private information being shared with these trusted partners.  The companies say that this data was not abused, but the point Erica is that the public didn't know. Users didn't know about these various uses of data.</p><p>Here are a few examples involving different big tech companies.  Sony and Microsoft, for example -- Amazon able to obtain e-mails with -- private messages with friends.  Netflix, Spotify, and the Royal Bank of Canada able to read, write, and delete private messages.</p><p>Yahoo! able to view a real-time feed of friends' post.  And, \"The New York Times\" which broke this story, also had access years ago -- access to friend lists.</p><p>Now these companies, like Spotify and Netflix, they say they did not abuse this access.  In many cases, they say they never even looked at all.  </p><p>The point, though, is that Facebook left the door open.  They left the door open for this access --</p><p>HILL:  Right.</p><p>STELTER:  -- and that seems very worrisome.</p><p>HILL:  Well, also, I mean, there are -- there are so many sort of layers to this, too.  Although you may -- you may not have done it but if you knew you could do it should you have raised a red flag?  That's a separate issue there. There is the range of information, as you pointed out there.  The ability to delete people's messages -- messages they thought were private. </p><p>Facebook is obviously responding.  Are they shedding much light on this?</p><p>STELTER:  Well, the company is saying what it's said, frankly, all year long, which is we need to do better, we've got problems.  </p><p>Here's a part of the statement from one of the company's representatives, saying, \"We know we've got work to do to regain people's trust.  Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that's what we've been focused on for most of 2018.\"</p><p>And look, Facebook has been under scrutiny all year long about these issues for a number of reasons.  There's this tension baked into the platform.  </p><p>Facebook is where I go to find out about my friends' and families' lives, their health concerns, their babies, their plans.  And yet, Facebook also profits from all that data and works with all these other companies.  And the headline from \"The New York Times\" overnight is that all these other companies also were able to be in that relationship and unbeknownst to users.</p><p>[07:45:06]  Now, technically, if you click the box -- if you hit OK, you might -- you might -- Facebook might say you've given permission.</p><p>HILL:  Right.</p><p>STELTER:  You've allowed it.  But I don't think users actually know what's going on.  </p><p>So there's two questions this morning.  One, did Facebook violate its 2012 agreement with the FTC -- its consent decree?  The company says it didn't; others say it may have.</p><p>And number two, what are regulators going to do now?  What is Washington going to do now to provide more oversight for these big companies?</p><p>HILL:  And question three -- and I think a lot of people at home have, too -- is any of this still going on --</p><p>STELTER:  It's still going on.</p><p>HILL:  -- and who may still have access, if anyone?  What are they doing with that?</p><p>STELTER:  Right.</p><p>HILL:  A lot of questions, not always a lot of answers.  We get them from you, though.  So, Brian, we appreciate that.</p><p>STELTER:  Well, thanks.</p><p>HILL:  Thank you -- John.</p><p>BERMAN:  All right.</p><p>Those Russian social media ads and posts designed to influence our election, they seem silly and almost obvious now.  So why were they so effective and what does that say about our deeply divided society?</p><p>Senior political analyst John Avlon has your reality check -- sir.</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  That's right.</p><p>So, the pair of new studies commissioned by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee first found that Russia's social media messaging ahead of the election, quote, \"Clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party and specifically, Donald Trump, as early as the GOP primaries.\"  And not to mention, of course, all of the requisite hitting on Hillary.</p><p>But what's really stunning is how Russia's efforts to spread misinformation over social media preyed on America's identity politics divides.  They targeted tribes on the far-right and far-left.  And to look through their characters of identity politics is to see how easily duped we are by dividers.</p><p>For example, Russian trolls targeted memes to the religious right in the name of the so-called Army of Jesus and their appeals were not exactly biblically-based.  </p><p>Here's a picture of Jesus arm-wrestling the devil as a proxy war for Clinton versus Trump.  Or this meme showing Trump and Pence as the Jesus team and Hillary and her running mate, Tim Kaine, as the Satan team.  There's even an image of Jesus wearing a MAGA hat.</p><p>And if you liked these you were duped by the Russians.</p><p>On the left, Russian trolls also targeted an African-American activist community, pretending to care about Black Lives Matter and victims of police violence on the prolific Blacktivist page.  At the same time, Russian trolls were pumping up the so-called Blue Lives Matter movement, showing police funerals and blaming them on Black Lives Matter activists.</p><p>Supposedly, patriotic gun rights memes were created and promoted by Russian trolls, like this image declaring that, quote, \"The 2nd Amendment Is My Gun Permit\" -- as well as LGBT pages like this adult coloring book offering a look at a quote-unquote \"Buff Bernie\" which we did not need to see.</p><p>There were anti-immigrant memes that echoed Trump's fearmongering about illegal immigrants voting.  And pages that celebrated the Confederate flag as heritage, not hate, and promoted Texas secession as the next step after Brexit.</p><p>There were memes that mocked politically correct culture and concerns about white supremacy and also attacking John McCain.  </p><p>Perhaps most sinister was when all of this fakeness aligned to attack real journalism, from fake George Orwell quotes to memes that compared North Korean propaganda to real news.</p><p>Now, if all this is enough to give you whiplash, that was part of the point.  The goal of this kind of disinformation is to confuse, divide, and distract -- to create anger and apathy, sometimes with the specific goal of driving down election turnout, such as this meme aimed at the African-American community or promoting the Green Party candidacy of Jill Stein, who received more votes in key swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania than Trump's victory margin.</p><p>In all, 10.4 million tweets, 116,000 Instagram posts, 61,000 Facebook posts, and 1,100 YouTube videos.  </p><p>But on the most fundamental level, the Russian trolls understood that our identity politics divides, the kind that focus on common enemies rather than our common humanity, is the real source of weakness in our society and they exploited it with unwitting Americans' help.</p><p>Now, there's a phrase used by the mass murdering founder of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin, that applies to folks who liked and shared these links -- \"useful idiots.\"</p><p>And that's your reality check.</p><p>BERMAN:  Sobering, and I'm not just talking about like the muscular workout Bernie Sanders.  The whole thing is sobering.</p><p>HILL:  Yes, the whole thing is.</p><p>AVLON:  It's surreal and sobering.</p><p>BERMAN:  All right, John.  Thanks very much.</p><p>HILL:  Hacked cables revealing how the international community really feels about President Trump, Iran, and Russia.  \"The New York Times\" reporter who broke this story joins us, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[07:53:24]  HILL:  \"The New York Times\" has obtained more than 1,000 hacked European diplomatic cables.  Those cables reveal the international community's serious concerns about President Trump, Russia, Iran, and more.</p><p>Let's discuss with the reporter who broke the story, national security correspondent for \"The New York Times\" and CNN political and national security analyst, David Sanger.</p><p>David, good to have you with us, as always.</p><p>Give us a sense as we look at these.  James Clapper was with us a little bit earlier and he said this certainly doesn't rise to the level of WikiLeaks in terms of the information that is now out here. But still, it's significant that somebody thought it important enough to steal it, post it somewhere to be found, and then have those folks share it with you.</p><p>DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Well, Erica, I think that's right.  I think Gen. Clapper is correct.  This is not on the scale of WikiLeaks, which was 250,000 U.S. cables.  And, frankly, Americans cared more about those cables because they were American in origin and I think did reveal a bit more.</p><p>In this case, the hackers who followed all the patterns of a Chinese People's Liberation Army group -- I don't think intended for any of these to become public.  </p><p>They did a sort of traditional phishing campaign against the European Union.  They got in through Cypress, a small and less well-defended member of the E.U.  And then, used that access to get all of the documents that -- appear to have gotten all of the documents that are exchanged daily among European diplomats through the E.U.'s main network.</p><p>[07:55:00]  In doing so, they briefly passed through some public sites on their way up to the cloud, and it was there that a company called Area 1 found them and turned about 1,000 of them over -- a little more than 1,000 of them over to us.</p><p>What they reveal, as you suggest, is that the diplomats get assurances from the National Security Council that President Trump didn't mean exactly what he said when he spoke with Vladimir Putin at that famous Helsinki press conference.  </p><p>They worry that the Russians have already put nuclear weapons into Crimea.  They are concerned that Iran will use the excuse of the U.S. coming out of the nuclear deal to restart their nuclear program.</p><p>HILL:  They also, too, were looking at even just a cable that refers to a July meeting with E.U. officials and Xi Jinping talking about U.S. demands -- both U.S. -- what we're hearing from the U.S. and U.S. demands are inconsistent.  </p><p>When that's the message that's going out which isn't shocking, perhaps, to a lot of people who have been following the headlines, obviously -- but does having this out there do any damage to relationships with these countries?</p><p>SANGER:  You know, at this point, given the state of relations between the European Union and the United States, I don't think so.  </p><p>The cable you refer to though, Erica, I think was one of the most interesting.  It was a private meeting between Xi Jinping, the president of China, and the Europeans in Beijing.  It was an E.U.- China summit in which President Xi basically says the Americans never live up to their word.  President Trump is bullying them.</p><p>But then he goes into this fascinating long reverie about how China, for 100 or 200 years, has bent to larger powers and in this case, now feels strong enough that it doesn't plan to go do it again.  And what's interesting is that the president views this entire thing transactionally --</p><p>HILL:  Yes.</p><p>SANGER:  -- and Xi views it as part of a long historical continuum in which the tide has turned and China is going to make sure that it doesn't get run over again.</p><p>HILL:  It certainly sets it up there, doesn't it?</p><p>As we talk about all of this -- and even just putting it into context as you did off the top -- these cables and this communication versus some of the other things that have been hacked and then leaked -- it still begs the question of what's the conversation like at \"The New York Times\" when Area 1 comes to you and say we have 1,000 cables that we found that someone hacked.  We want you to have them.  We think you should publish them.</p><p>How is that decision made because there's still people at home who are going to say why should we see these?</p><p>SANGER:  You know, that's a very good question and we debated this at some length, and here was the reasoning.</p><p>First of all, these were posted in an open site.  It's not as if we got them through a hacking process or that Area 1 did, as well.  The Chinese, in moving them -- or whoever the hackers were, though they certainly appear to be China-based -- did that.</p><p>Secondly, there were no big national secrets here.  There were no nuclear codes.  These were at the restricted level and confidential level.  They were not top-secret documents.  </p><p>And thirdly, as we looked at it they sort of gave a backstory, one that you would frequently get in background conversations with European officials and others, to their interchanges with the president, with the Chinese, with the Iranians.  And it just sort of confirmed how they're talking to each other on it.</p><p>There were no great privacy revelations here, Erica.  These weren't -- these didn't get into personally private data in any way.  They were the kind of discussions you would get in a background candid conversation if you sat down with a European official.</p><p>HILL:  They also, which I know you've pointed out and which James Clapper also did point out as well this morning -- they also pinpoint the fact that people have been concerned about the communications systems within the E.U. for some time and there's a question about what this could lead to in terms of changes.</p><p>David, we're out of time.</p><p>SANGER:  Absolutely.</p><p>HILL:  You're always appreciated.  Thank you. SANGER:  Thank you.</p><p>HILL:  Michael Flynn's legal journey is far from over.  NEW DAY continues right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The FBI broke standard protocol in the way that they came in and ambushed Gen. Flynn.</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  I'm very proud of the way the FBI conducted itself.</p><p>EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  This judge repeatedly went back to Flynn to make him say that he was, indeed, guilty.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He stepped in front of a judge and said nope, I lied and I intended to.  None of this makes sense to me.</p><p>KEN STARR, FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL:  We have a rule of law country. We saw that with checks and balances of Judge Sullivan.</p><p>REP.

It is Wednesday, December --</p><p>[Byline: John Berman, Erica Hill, Catherine Rampell, Stephen Moore, Brian Stelter, John Avlon, David Sanger] [High: World markets are mixed this morning as U.S. stocks appear to be set for a solid opening.  A rally fizzled yesterday as Dow and S&amp;P 500 remain on pace for their worst December since 1931 which, of course, was in the middle of the Great Depression.  According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, Facebook arranged to share user data with 150 companies in an attempt to get more users while thwarting the platform's own privacy rules.  Amazon got users' names and contact information through friend networks, and Netflix and Spotify had the ability to read Facebook users' private messages.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is set to release two reports on Monday detailing the breadth of the Russian social media campaign to sow discord in the United States.  The reports are based on troves of data that Facebook, Twitter, and Google handed over to the committee about the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election and American politics generally.  A cybersecurity firm says hackers were able to infiltrate a European Union communications system for years and copy thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables, The New York Times has reported.  Area 1, the cybersecurity firm which discovered the vulnerability, said thousands of E.U. diplomatic cables were accessed using techniques resembling those long used by an elite unit of China's People's Liberation Army.] [Spec: Stock Markets; Dow; S&amp;P 500; China; Trade; Affordable Care Act; Recession; Economy; China; Trade War; Alan Greenspan; Politics; Donald Trump; Xi Jinping; Federal Reserve; Jerome Powell; Rate Hike; Facebook; User Data; Sony; Microsoft; Amazon; Netflix; Spotify; Royal Bank of Canada; Private Messages; Yahoo!; The New York Times; FTC; Violation; Oversight; Russia; Social Media; Campaign; Discord; Presidential Election; United States; Republican Party; Hillary Clinton; Memes; Hack; European; Cables; Russia; Iran; Chinese People's Liberation Army; Phishing; European Union; Area 1; National Security Council; Vladimir Putin; Nuclear Weapons; Crimea] </p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAN HOPKINS, CNN ANCHOR: You're looking at live pictures from the New York Stock Exchange.  We are less than 60 seconds away from the closing bell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good afternoon, I'm Jan Hopkins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's find out how these markets are doing in this last minute of trading.</p><p>Greg Clarkin, first.</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jan, make no mistake about it, the general is definitely in charge today.  I'll show you how shares of General Electric led the Dow to an almost triple-digit gain.</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Susan Lisovicz at the Nasdaq.</p><p>The Nasdaq rallies back briefly after yesterday's triple-digit loss only to fall even further, plummeting to a 4 percent decline on the day.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Jeff Flock at the IRS' busiest tax preparedness center in the country.  I'll be back in a little bit with the future of your tax returns.</p><p>HOPKINS: Plus, do you drive to other neighborhoods for cheaper gas? We'll be talking about zone pricing and why it means higher gas prices in general.</p><p>It's Wednesday, March 29th.  Welcome to STREET SWEEP.</p><p>We have a tale of two markets today.  A good day here at the New York Stock Exchange.  A late-day rally in blue-chip stocks led by General Electric.</p><p>Greg Clarkin joins us from the floor to tell us about the Dow Jones industrial average -- Greg.</p><p>CLARKIN: And Jan, I'll tell you if every stock has its day, today was definitely the day for some of those neglected stocks, especially the retailing components of the Dow.  We saw shares of Wal- Mart at the close up better than $4, up almost 4 1/2.  Shares of Home Depot up almost $4.  A couple of stocks that had been neglected by investors who have been chasing those spectacular gains in the tech sector up until recently, that is.</p><p>Today, we saw a lot of folks moving money, redeploying their funds out of that tech sector, kind of rushing back to the safety of some of these very familiar names with maybe less than spectacular growth prospects, but still, today they were really the stars.  We saw shares of Procter &amp; Gamble and Coca-Cola, two stocks that have been in deep trouble lately, also higher.</p><p>But really, the wonder today was General Electric.  I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that later in the show.  Very positive comments from an analyst today.  G.E. stock at last check was up almost $9.</p><p>Jan, right now the blue chips settling with about an 84-point gain.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>HOPKINS: Moving like an Internet stock.  Thanks, Greg Clarkin.</p><p>The Nasdaq taking a massive hit today.  In fact, it is the third- worst point loss ever for the Nasdaq.  Chip stocks were hurt and Internet stocks were hurt.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz is at the scene of the action, she can tell us all about it -- Susan.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Hello, Jan.</p><p>Well, it's a pattern we've seen all too often here at the Nasdaq, explosive spurts only to be followed by really violent declines.  We did actually have a rally at the open, buying on the dip perhaps, but it was brief.  Within about 20 minutes the selling began only to accelerate at day's end and we closed at the low today.  As you mentioned, the third worst point loss ever.  What was it?</p><p>Well, some traders say it was continuing jitters over Abby Joseph Cohen, the enthusiastic bull on Wall Street, continuing to reverberate throughout the market.  Also, some negative -- very negative comments from a man who is really known for his stock investments overseas, but nonetheless dire predictions from him on Internet stocks, that did not help matters.  We saw selling across the board.  Biotechs down 6 1/2 percent.  Computers down 4 percent.  Financial stocks down 2 percent. They were selling across the board here.</p><p>Back to you, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: You are talking about Mark Mobious (ph).  I understand he said that Internet stocks could fall 90 percent.  They're talking about it here on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange even.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Jan, you know what is interesting is a lot of people weren't talking about it, but the fact that some were did not help on a day when you have this kind of trend going where you have this selling, and that's certainly the case this week.  A lot of traders were saying this is a man who's really not known for his stock picks in Internets, but nonetheless this did not help following Abby's comments just yesterday.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Susan Lisovicz at the Nasdaq market site.</p><p>Joining us now from St. Louis, Missouri, with his reaction to today's tech tumble is semiconductor analyst Christopher Chaney of A.G. Edwards.  Semiconductor stocks part of the reason for this damage in the Nasdaq, right, Chris?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER CHANEY, A.G. EDWARDS: Certainly they are, and they're a big part of the tech makeup of the Nasdaq, so -- and the techs were hit pretty hard today.  So I think that's one of the reasons you've seen the Nasdaq down so hard today.</p><p>HOPKINS: Well, semiconductor stocks have behaved very well in the last few weeks.  So it's just some profit taking or is it something more?</p><p>CHANEY: Well, the semis have been really erratic over the past few weeks.  I've noticed that, you know, you'll have a very strong couple of days followed by just a real dismal, you know, rest of the week.  It's happened for the past few weeks.  When I looked at the SOX index, which is the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and the index itself was up 95 percent so far since January 1st.  So it doesn't surprise me that some people are looking at their gains that they've had in the first quarter and taking some of the profit off the table. That's not unusual.  I think that is probably called for in most cases.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Christopher Chaney of A.G. Edwards.</p><p>CHANEY: Sure.</p><p>HOPKINS: Oil prices collapsing today after yesterday's OPEC agreement to start pumping more oil.  Light sweet crude in New York below its recent nine-year high of nearly $35.  Now trading at $26.41, down 68 cents today.</p><p>Fred Katayama was in the oil pits at the New York Mercantile Exchange earlier, he has an update from our New York bureau -- Fred.</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jan, traders turned even more bearish today, pushing down the price of the benchmark light sweet crude by almost 3 percent.  This after Iran, which had opted out of the OPEC agreement, said it too would boost production.  Later, Mexico pledged to expand its oil exports.  President Clinton hailed OPEC's decision, saying it's good news for American consumers.</p><p>Now, analysts predict some oil producers will continue to cheat by producing amounts beyond the agreed upon quotas.  Once that is accounted for, a total of nearly 1 million barrels a day of new crude oil should hit the markets.  Traders predict that the new oil should keep prices in a band between $22-$27 a barrel.  They argue that political pressure should help keep prices below $30.</p><p>But some oil analysts are skeptical.  With demand for gasoline expected to rise during the summer driving season and given low stockpiles of crude oil, they say the price of a barrel can shoot back up to $30 by late spring -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: And maybe no relief for all of us buying gas at the gas pumps, right?</p><p>KATAYAMA: Not soon, Jan, not soon.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Fred Katayama in our New York bureau.</p><p>Joining us now here at the New York Stock Exchange with his perspective on today's market is Vince Farrell of Spears, Benzak, Salomon &amp; Farrell.</p><p>Vince, welcome.</p><p>Big sell-off in the Nasdaq, what's going on?</p><p>VINCE FARRELL, SPEARS, BENZAK, SALOMON &amp; FARRELL: Well, it could be just another lurching move to find the rotational group that you want to be in or out of.  But I think maybe it's more than that.  Many stocks in the Nasdaq got to what I considered to be unsustainable valuations, and once a shift starts I think it might spread.</p><p>Now, we've seen on the other side of the equation, energy stocks, pharmaceutical stocks, and most importantly, financial stocks starting to act better and that tells me money wants to stay in the marketplace, but it's going to seek another home, and I think we are going to see this continue.  But it's going to be backing and filling. It's by no means a one-way direction.</p><p>But I just think those companies in the Nasdaq got to levels that are beyond reasonable.  And I don't know if, like Mark Mobius seems to think that the Internet stocks have 90 percent downside.  I think some of them do, but not the industry.  There clearly is a lot of downside in a lot of those high-tech names, and I think we're going to start to see it over the next few months.</p><p>HOPKINS: Vince Farrell, thanks.</p><p>And you can find out which stocks Vince predicts could be big movers in tomorrow's session by logging on to our Web site, cnnfn.com, and then click on the STREET SWEEP \"Shakers\" section.</p><p>Up next on STREET SWEEP: the tug-of-war between the government and Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez appears to be coming to a head. The latest just ahead.</p><p>Plus, the taxman cometh!  The April 15th tax filing deadline is fast approaching.  We go behind the scenes at the IRS for a glimpse at just what happens to your return when you file.  We'll be back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOPKINS: You're looking at live pictures from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  This is stock futures trading just before the close there, which is in a few minutes, and we'll find out what prices are doing in just a few minutes.</p><p>Have you ever driven out of your neighborhood to find cheaper gas prices?  We'll talk about this with the Connecticut attorney general. He is upset about what's called zoned gas prices.</p><p>First, let's check in with Kyra Phillips at the CNN Center in Atlanta, she has all the latest headlines -- Kyra.</p><p>KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks, Jan.</p><p>The top lawyer for the INS says if there's a change in the immigration status of Elian Gonzalez tomorrow that does not mean the agency will immediately take the boy by force.  That's a concern of the Cuban child's Miami relatives.  The INS wants the family to agree by tomorrow to surrender the boy if they lose their court battle to keep him in the U.S.  So far, they're refusing to do that.  A meeting between the two sides was scheduled to begin just a short time ago.</p><p>Part of downtown Fort Worth, Texas, is closed after back-to-back tornadoes batter the city and suburban areas.  The storms kill at least three people and injure dozens more.  In downtown Fort Worth, windows in several skyscrapers are blown out and debris is scattered across a wide area.  The damage from those funnel clouds is so bad that Texas Governor George W. Bush declares the whole county a disaster area.</p><p>Foundations in the U.S. open their wallets and give more to nonprofit groups.  Last year's giving totaled nearly $23 billion. That's a big jump from the year before.  The booming economy is said to be one of the reasons for the increase.</p><p>More news at anytime.  I'm Kyra Phillips in Atlanta.</p><p>Now back to Jan in New York.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Kyra.</p><p>Yesterday's OPEC agreement to boost oil output expected to lower gasoline prices roughly 18 cents a gallon by year-end, but that may not be soon enough for some cities.  Dealers believe that oil companies are pricing gasoline based on how much they feel the gas stations' customers can afford.  Connecticut attorney general says the practice, called \"zone pricing,\" should be outlawed, and he joins us now from Hartford with more.</p><p>Welcome, Mr. Blumenthal.</p><p>RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Thank you.</p><p>HOPKINS: So how does it work in Connecticut?  If you live in Greenwich where houses are more than a million dollars, you pay for gasoline. BLUMENTHAL: If you live in Greenwich, you may pay anywhere from 6 to 10 cents more than, for example, living in Berlin or Central Connecticut, likewise, if you live in Albany, you pay maybe 10 cents less than if you lived in New York City.  And if you live in a downtown area, you may also pay more, not because you're more wealthy, but because you're isolated.  And the insidious part of this practice is that it's secret and concealed and really a restraint on the free market.</p><p>HOPKINS: Why is it not illegal?</p><p>BLUMENTHAL: It's not illegal because there are loopholes in the Robinson-Patman Act, which is the federal law that would otherwise apply to price discrimination, and it should be illegal.  In fact, we've sought to make it illegal in Connecticut and other states have done the same.  But so far, the big oil companies have managed to outlobby us.</p><p>HOPKINS: Let me ask you about something else that you're involved in, the Microsoft settlement talks.  You're one of the state attorneys general involved.  You're in Connecticut today.  I guess you're not sitting in those talks.  Are the states involved?</p><p>BLUMENTHAL: The states are very much involved in the Microsoft case.  We've been an active, aggressive, intensively involved partner with of course the Department of Justice.  There are 19 states involved in this action, really to make sure that the monopolistic practices that have been proved so dramatically on the part of Microsoft are ended once and for all, and that we have innovation and competition as consumers deserve.</p><p>HOPKINS: So how are the settlement talks going?  Is there going to be a settlement, or a ruling from the judge?</p><p>BLUMENTHAL: You know, we have really very, very steadfastly declined to talk about either the talks or potential remedies, except to say, and this point is critical, that the remedies have to be fundamental and far reaching to protect consumers, make sure that innovation is permitted to proceed, and in the end, assure that competition goes forward free and unrestrained without the kind of monopolistic abuses that Microsoft has practiced.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general.</p><p>Still ahead on STREET SWEEP, we'll bring you today's big winners and losers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: Let's see how the market could open up tomorrow morning. Let's head to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where S&amp;P futures are closing right now.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers is standing by.</p><p>Ceci, how does it look?</p><p>CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Jan.</p><p>Well, the futures market is really rich in trader lingo to the underlying stock market.  In fact, we're up five points over fair value.  That's where the futures closed.  So barring any developments overnight, you're looking at a gain on the Dow of 40 points at the opening bell tomorrow without even blinking, so people are expecting that this quarter end window dressing back into the older economy stocks and out of tech, especially in the wake of all this Tiger Fund rumors about dumping high-tech stocks because of heavy redemptions in the fund.</p><p>So that seems to be the impetus today into the S&amp;P and the Dow. But we're at very rich values, and it reflects a lot of optimism -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Ceci Rodgers in Chicago.</p><p>Let's take a look at some of today's Big Board movers, rejoin Greg Clarkin here on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>CLARKIN: And, Jan, let's start with General Electric.  This morning, Prudential Securities analyst Nick Haimen (ph) out with a research report, saying that GE is really poised to undergo a transformation not only in how they do business, but how they service their clients and their customers as well.  He says this company will be a major player in e-commerce, offering software and services to their clients, which will create a transformation of these client's backroom offices to just really a much bigger player in the so-called new economy than many folks had anticipated.</p><p>General Electric shares at the close, we saw them up over $8 to a new 52-week high, trading up around $164 a share.  And by the way, General Electric's unit NBC today announcing that they are partnering with the WWFWorld Wrestling Federation and their new football league.</p><p>Also we saw shares of Microsoft higher for a second day, up better than 2 at the close on renewed optimism that the company may reach an out-of-court settlement with the government before the judge issues his final verdict on this in early April.  On the downside, a big tech loser on the Dow today, Hewlett-Packard shares, they were down, as were Intel and IBM, Microsoft really breaking with that pattern.</p><p>Jan, back to you.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Greg.</p><p>Let's go to the Nasdaq marketsite and bring in fn's Susan Lisovicz again.</p><p>The third worst point loss ever for the Nasdaq.  Susan, what about some of the movers?</p><p>LISOVICZ: Well, and there were some big movers needless to say, Jan. In fact, I'm hard pressed to pick out the worst among the lot, but I will try.  Lam Research, just one of the many chip stocks that got slammed today for a second day.  In fact, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down 5 percent.  Lam actually on some good news that it has won a $25 million contract from a semiconductor manufacturing provider in Malaysia, but not to be -- no buying today on this stock.  Terrayon losing 36 points, nearly 37 points in a single day.  It makes cable modem systems.  Also good news for this company.  One of the largest cable Internet operators in China has selected this company's broadband cable modem system, not buying today.  And finally, down 15 percent on the news, Qualcomm one of the few bright spots.  Even though telecoms were down 3 percent, it gained 2.  And Lehman Brothers had nice comments to say about Qualcomm.</p><p>Back to you Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thank, Susan.</p><p>If you are not one of the millions of Americans who have filed who has filed your taxes online then you'll have until midnight April 17 to get your return postmarked.</p><p>CNN correspondent Jeff Flock is live at an IRS processing center in Ogden, Utah with a look at the difference between electronic an paper filing.</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>FLOCK: That's right, Jan.  We are peering into the future here in Ogden, Utah, which is the IRS's busiest tax processing center. We've got cameras all the over this center today, and we've been following the process, the old process, all the way through from start to finish.  We began in a room that has a lot of old wooden tables, called tingle tables.  This is where the paper returns are sorted from there onto an area where they are reviewed and people try and figure out what's on the tax forms, and hopefully get all of the data in right.  And then on to a place where the data is all entered into a computer.  A lot of steps in the process along the way.</p><p>But this young lady here holds what is an interim step to the future.</p><p>But this disk that you hold in your hand, Sandy Read, holds how many returns?</p><p>SANDY READ, ASSISTANT MANAGER, E-FILE: It holds over 3 million returns.</p><p>FLOCK: They were filed how?</p><p>READ: They were filed electronically.  We call it E-File here at the IRS.</p><p>FLOCK: And that is the future, I take it?</p><p>READ: That is the future.</p><p>FLOCK: Now I read somewhere where you expect to have perhaps 80 percent of taxpayers filing by the year 2007.</p><p>READ: Yes, that is correct.</p><p>FLOCK: What makes you think that will happen, because you're nowhere near that now?</p><p>READ: Well, right now, 30 million taxpayers chose to file last year that way.  We're expecting 35 million this year.  And it's just becoming easier to do.  You can get a Telefile package or you can just go right to your telephone and file.  You can go online on your home computer and file or you could go to a tax professional and have them transmit the returns for you.</p><p>FLOCK: As we said, this is old the future; this is a disk, and this is old technology, correct?</p><p>READ: Yes, this is what we used to store our returns on.  This year, we are storing them on a server so all 26 sites can access them at any time at our customer service sites.</p><p>FLOCK: That is the future.</p><p>READ: Yes, it is.</p><p>FLOCK: Sandy Read, thank you so much for peering into the future with us here at the IRS.  We have behind the scenes all day here on CNN and CNNfn.  That's the latest.  I'm Jeff Flock, CNN, reporting live from Ogden, Utah.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Jeff.</p><p>FLOCKS: Shares of Sycamore Networks tumbling today, along with most technology issues.  This is one of the leaders in the booming field of fiberoptic products that speed up Internet access for businesses.  Sycamore Networks down $13 today at about $125 each, but that stock is still up 237 percent since its initial public offering, which was last November.</p><p>Joining us now with more on what Sycamore Networks does and its prospects is the company's CEO Dan Smith and Gururaj Deshpande, the chairman of Sycamore Networks.</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome.</p><p>DAN SMITH, CEO, SYCAMORE NETWORKS: Well, thank you for having us.</p><p>HOPKINS: First of all, your personal stakes in these companies off about a half-billion dollars today in this tech sell-off.  Is that the kind of day that you really worry about?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think, clearly, no one likes to see a day where it's down, but I think we have a long-term perspective of the prospects for this company, and the opportunities that we face in supplying the demand for bandwidth is appearing all over the globe. HOPKINS: I should point out you are still with about $5 billion on paper with your stock holdings in the company, so a half-billion here, a half-billion there doesn't amount to very much.</p><p>Desh, for you -- what are you providing for all of us in the fiberoptic products?  What will key be able to see and do as a result?</p><p>GURURAJ DESHPANDE, CHAIRMAN, SYCAMORE NETWORKS: You know, Jan, there's a lot of things that need to be figured out in the new economy, but what's given for certain is the fact it's going to need a lot of bandwidth, and in fact, one of your staff members took out a fiberoptic cable here for me.  One of these things in here, a fiberoptic, as thin as a hair, can carry hundreds of laser beams and carry millions and billions of bits per second, and that's the sort of excitement in all this technology and the future that holds for all of us.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thank you very much, Deshpande and Dan Smith of Sycamore Networks.</p><p>For the preview of what's coming up on \"MONEYLINE\" tonight, let's bring in Stuart Varney -- Stuart.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, \"MONEYLINE\" ANCHOR: Thank you , Jan.  Tonight on \"MONEYLINE,\" question, are the big-money techs on track for a big tumble? With the Nasdaq slammed for a second day in a row, fund manager Mark Mobius says a \"crash\" -- and that's his word -- just might be coming.  Plus, the fund guru they call Super Mario.  A year after Dow 10000, we'll ask Mario Gabelli what's driving the new blue- chip resurgence.  And taking stock of the OPEC deal, energy powerhouse Daniel Yergin.  We'll ask him how this agreement will play at the pump -- your money.  That's \"MONEYLINE\" at 6:30 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>Back to you, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Very interesting.</p><p>Thanks, Stuart.</p><p>Up next, financial editor Myron Kandel and market strategist Vince Farrell give us the bottom line on this day on Wall Street.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: Joining us now from our New York studios, financial editor Myron Kandel.</p><p>You can go ahead, Mike.</p><p>MYRON KANDEL, CNN FINANCIAL EDITOR: Well, you know, Jan, again today, three stocks led the way in the Dow.  Three stocks -- GE, Wal- Mart and Home Depot -- accounted for a total of 85 points in the Dow, and that's the entire gain, and this points up the selectivity of this market.  Technology stocks got murdered.  Other stocks, retailers, oils and others did well. This is a market of stocks, not a stock market in general.  I'm sure Vince agrees with that. FARRELL: I do, Mike.  The past few weeks I've seen it broadening out in the financial area especially.  They bounced off their lows and they've not been robust but they've been OK, pharmaceutical stocks have been more than OK.  And energy stocks have been terrific the past little bit, but energy is not a big enough component of the S&amp;P 500 to really take over the leadership.  I do think you need pharmaceuticals, health care and financial if we want to see the broader market continue to do well.</p><p>HOPKINS: Mike, what do you think about what Mark Mobius said on Internet stocks, down 90 percent?</p><p>KANDEL: Well, you know, with all due respect to Mark, he's an expert on emerging country stocks, not necessarily on Internet, but a lot of people are warning about the danger, Abby really did it yesterday, in technology stocks in general.  So I think those warnings have to be heeded, but it's no time for panic, however, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: You agree, Vince?</p><p>FARRELL: Agreed.  I think those stocks, Jan, that may well be down 90 percent.  But I think the Internet as a group is going to be extremely vital and healthy.  But I do think as a group they will be off from their current level, but it's not a flash in the pan.  It's not like the biotechs in '91.  We got all excited about biotechs, but we still had a long regulatory process.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Vince Farrell and Myron Kandel.</p><p>And that's it for this half hour of STREET SWEEP.</p><p>Next on CNN, \"SHOWBIZ TODAY\" looks at the controversy over ABC's new drama \"Wonderland.\" And for our CNNfn viewers, find out whether a new Internet business to business deal could lower your medical bills.</p><p>I'm Jan Hopkins.

I'm Willow Bay in Los Angeles.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Hi, Willow.  Hello, everyone.  I'm Allan Chernoff in New York.</p><p>BAY: We begin tonight with a sigh of relief on Wall Street. Stocks today extended the dramatic rally that began late yesterday, an encouraging end to what was a hairy week on Wall Street.</p><p>But getting there was not all smooth sailing.  The Dow was down more than 50 points at its low today, back in bear market territory, but the index regained its footing, ending up 115 points at 9,504. From the low yesterday, it has gained nearly 400 points.</p><p>The big winners included IBM, Microsoft, which rallied yesterday, financial stocks American Express and Citigroup, and the oldest Dow component of them all, GE. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 22 points to end at 1,139, a gain there of 2 percent.  And the Nasdaq advanced for the second day in a row, up nearly 31 points, closing at 1,928.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Today's bounce back didn't come a minute too soon for investors whipsawed over the past five sessions.  Greg Clarkin takes us through a week that brought the Dow Industrials within a hair of a bear market for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Monday, the week began innocently enough with investors optimistic ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting.  Dual rallies on the Dow and the Nasdaq had traders feeling good and analysts saying prices were just too attractive to pass up.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CLARKIN: \u2026 Tuesday, the markets played the waiting game, edgy and anxious as the Federal Reserve met with interest rates hanging in the balance until\u2026</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Twenty seconds to go here as we await for this decision by the Federal Reserve.  Again, the big debate has been: 50 or 75.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARKIN: It was 50 basis points, Alan Greenspan rate cut not enough for anxious investors who drove the Dow lower by more than 200 points, and knocked the Nasdaq down by close to 5 percent.</p><p>Wednesday, the selling began anew as traders struggled to keep up.  The Dow ended down 2 1/2 percent; the Nasdaq dropped 1 1/2 percent.</p><p>Thursday, a traumatic morning on Wall Street as investors sold early and often.  The Dow plunged almost 400, dropping to within points of 9,100, deep in bear market territory, as sell orders rained down on Wall Street.  A late afternoon rally saved the blue chips, they finished with just a 97 point loss, the Nasdaq, meanwhile, staged a sharp rally.</p><p>Friday brought green arrows and relief on Wall Street.  The Dow jumped more than 1 1/2 percent; the Nasdaq posted a similar rally. Analyst are optimistic, as well as realistic.</p><p>SAM GINSBERG, GRUNTAL &amp; CO: We do have the chance to rally here, but again, I will repeat that this market absolutely does not go up in a straight line, and it does not go down in a straight line, so be prepared for the swings, be prepared to be confused.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) CLARKIN: And confusion was indeed the word of the week, traders and analysts were confused as to where the lurching markets would go next, while investors just tried to hang on and survive one of the choppiest weeks in recent memory -- Allan.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Greg, the week at the Fed simply couldn't provide the stock market.</p><p>CLARKIN: Exactly.  A lot of disappointment there on Tuesday.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Greg Clarkin, thanks very much -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Allan, taking a quick look at the damage to the Dow this week: not as bad as you might suspect, the Dow fell more than 3 percent.  Last Friday, the index closed out its worst week since 1989, and the Nasdaq gained ground on the week, up 2 percent.  It is the first winning week for the index since January.</p><p>So, what drove tech stocks higher today? Well, let's go to John Metaxas at the Nasdaq market site for the look at the big movers there -- John?</p><p>JOHN METAXAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, the last couple days, we finally got some positive action after that disappointment earlier in the week over that 50 basis point cut.  And with the rally in the Nasdaq came some fantastic performances for some stocks this week.</p><p>Let's take a look at the leaders.  Rambus, one of the biggest gainers on the week, up 62 percent, and this is coming of off depressed levels last Friday.  The chips had a fantastic week here today, chip equipment stocks such as Applied Materials and KLA-Tencor with double digit gains.  Some of the big-cap Nasdaq stocks also surged.  Dell Computer up 16 percent on the week, Oracle up 13 percent.</p><p>Now the gains today, part of the post-Fed rally, if you will, came despite the fact that there was negative news and negative sentiment.  Analysts were down -- were lowering their estimates on Cisco Systems, there were concerns about them even meeting some of the lowered numbers.  The stock was down 5 percent today, it was the most actively traded.

And today, President Bush signaled he's open to working out a plan.  Peter Viles has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It took some of the darkest days Wall Street has seen in years and some strong criticism. \"The Wall Street Journal\" accused Washington of, quote, \"fiddling while the economy burns.\" But Washington is finally stirring. Members of both parties now pushing for immediate tax cuts to jump- start the economy, up to $60 billion beyond what is in the president's 10-year plan.</p><p>And today, the president said he's willing to consider it.</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We can accelerate tax relief and should accelerate tax relief, and keep the size of the tax relief package at the same level.</p><p>VILES: The version of the Bush tax cut that passed the House contained only $5.6 billion in income tax cuts this fiscal year, but House leaders now say they are open to much more.</p><p>JOHN RYDING, BEAR STEARNS: I think what Washington is reacting to now is the decline in the equity market, which over the last couple of weeks, has been fairly severe, making people think that the economy is in much worse shape than perhaps people inside of Washington, D.C. thought.</p><p>VILES: Senate Democrats Jon Corzine and Bob Graham say they can cut $60 billion in taxes this year by slashing the 15 percent bracket to 10 percent.  Savings for a family of four: $840 this year.  Senate Republicans say they too want 60 billion in immediate cuts, but they have not determined which taxes to cut or how to distribute the tax cuts.</p><p>A potential snag, though: Republicans want to link this year's cuts to the president's 10-year plan.  Democrats, however, want to the vote on the immediate tax cuts first.</p><p>SEN. TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Why not take what we already agree on, in the name of expeditious response to economic concerns raised by leaders in both parties, why not get this money out now?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: Economists have generally dismissed the impact of a $5 billion tax cut this year as insignificant; 60 billion, however, is real money, and could add more than 1/2 of percentage point to economic growth -- Allan.</p><p>CHERNOFF: And Peter, we'll be talking to a few key players on that issue in just a few minutes.  Thank you very much -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Allan, still to come on MONEYLINE: so, how is President Bush doing in his new job?  We'll have the latest poll numbers, what Americans think about his performance, his tax plan and whether the U.S. is headed into a recession, and it's -- as we just reported, some Republicans and Democrats push for a tax cut now.  We'll hear from both sides of the aisle about how to pay for it, Senators Chuck Grassley and Kent Conrad.</p><p>Plus, Bobby Knight will soon be back in business on the basketball court.  We're expecting to hear within the next hour from the controversial coach.  CNN will bring you there live.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: A new CNN-Time Warner poll is out, showing a majority of Americans approve of how President Bush is handling his job, but say they are nervous about the state of the economy.</p><p>The poll, conducted March 21st to 22nd, gave the president a 55 percent approval rating, but 53 percent think the president pays too much attention to big business.</p><p>Regarding the economy, 58 percent think that Mr. Bush's comments about a possible recession have affected the economy.  Forty-nine percent of Americans think we'll see a recession within the next 12 months.  Now that's far more than in 1989, on the eve of the last recession.  And nearly half of Americans say the stock market's decline has affected their family, far more than after the crash of October of 1987.</p><p>Now, as for tax cuts, some 51 percent support the president's tax cut plan, up slightly from last month.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Despite that support, some Senate Republicans do not think the Bush tax plan works fast enough to jump start the slowing economy.  As Peter Viles reported, they're calling for an immediate $60 billion tax cut, in addition to the Bush plan.</p><p>To talk about it we're joined right now, from Cedar Rapids, by Iowa Republican, Senator Charles Grassley.</p><p>Senator, thanks for joining us.  And you just saw the numbers. Do we really need this immediate action from the Senate, from the Congress?</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R), IOWA: Well, first of all, there's more tax revenue coming in.  People are over taxed, and so it's right to give the money to the people to spend.  And we need to move that money out of Washington into the taxpayers pockets.  It'll stimulate the economy. It's the right thing to do.</p><p>But the suggestion that we just ought to do it for one year and do that separately, and not have the long-term tax restructuring that the president's plan had, would be the wrong thing to do, because, really, the economic good of $60 billion this year in the taxpayer's pocket is a spit in the ocean to the economic good that will come from the restructuring of the tax code.</p><p>And since we have a 50/50 Senate, I think we ought to be able to work out a compromise between putting the $60 billion into the taxpayers pockets, which I think the Democrats want to do as well as Republicans, and then restructure the tax code.  Maybe not exactly the way the president wants it done, but restructure it so we have 10 years of economic growth comes from it.</p><p>CHERNOFF: But Senator, to push the entire plan through, it appears that it would take some time, and a lot of people saying we need immediate help for the economy.</p><p>GRASSLEY: Well, even if we pass a tax bill this very day, by the time that the Treasury Department could notify everybody to change their W-2 form, they tell me, in Treasury Department, it would take six to eight weeks.</p><p>So, if you think that you can pass a bill today and verify that the right tax payers are getting the money, it isn't possible to write a check and you don't want to, obviously, send an airplane over the United States and scatter the money around.  We've got to make sure that it's done in a verifiable able way, going to the taxpayers, and the best way to do that is to adjust the with holding that takes place.</p><p>CHERNOFF: So, very briefly, Senator, then it just simply does not matter if we get that $60 billion through?  Are you saying we shouldn't even bother with that?</p><p>GRASSLEY: Oh, just the opposite.  You ought to listen very closely.  I said that it's very important that we do it for two reasons.  One, the taxpayers are over taxed.  When they are over taxed they ought to be allowed to keep the money.  And secondly, if you leave it in Washington it will be frittered away in spending, because it's burning a hole in taxpayer's pockets, and thirdly, it will be a real economic stimulus to get it out.</p><p>CHERNOFF: OK, Senator Grassley.  Thank you, very much.</p><p>Let's now move over to the Democratic side of the aisle.</p><p>Senator Kent Conrad, of North Dakota, and he comes to us from Capitol Hill.</p><p>Senator, you heard what your friend from other side of the aisle said.  Do you think we need the $60 billion immediately, or should we attach it to the entire Bush tax plan?</p><p>SEN. KENT CONRAD (D), NORTH DAKOTA: Well, a number of us on the Democratic side have been advocating for weeks that we have immediate stimulus.  And we have fought the president's for having virtually no stimulus this year, so it's too small now, and it's too big over the ten-year period that threatens to put us back into deficit, and to raid the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare.</p><p>So, on our side, we believe we should take immediate action on the $60 billion of stimulus for this economy now, and then later this year, take action on a 10 year package that's affordable and that's fair.  But we don't think we should delay the $60 billion stimulus to wait for the larger package to pass, because that will take months.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Well, it sounds like some of the Republicans, in fact, do want to have that delay.  Can we resolve the issue in the Senate?</p><p>CONRAD: Look, we've already agreed on how much money should go out.  I think the Republicans, as they think about it, will realize that waiting for the whole package makes no sense at all.  That just delays getting money out into the economy, into people's pockets that can help give some lift to this economy.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Briefly, Senator, how much help would this really give the economy?  It would average to $300 a person.  Is that really a big deal?</p><p>CONRAD: Well, it depends on where you are.  We are proposing rate cut plus direct payments to individuals.  That could be as much as $900 a taxpayer.  What difference would it make?  Economists tell us it could add 3/4 to 1 percent to the growth of our gross domestic product.</p><p>When you're growing at next to nothing, that helps.  It doesn't solve the problem.  Let's not overstate it, but it would help, along with monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board to keep lowering interest rates, because that's the main driver here.  That's the thing that can most help.  But we also believe this additional stimulus will be of assistance too.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Senator Kent Conrad, thank you very much -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Allan, straight ahead, the list of layoffs is getting longer at two of America's most well-known tech names.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Topping tonight's corporate headlines: The growing tally of high-tech layoffs.  Job cuts mount at Motorola, the world's number two cell phone maker, slashing another 4,000 jobs.  Since December, Motorola has announced 22,000 layoffs.  That's 15 percent of it's work force.</p><p>And networking giant, 3COM, cutting another 170 jobs in its broadband division, bringing total cuts there to nearly 1,400.  The move was widely expected.  Earlier this week, 3COM CEO, Bruce Caflin, warned of continued layoffs, saying \"Business is only going to get worse before it gets better.\"</p><p>Checking those stocks: both barely budged the session, Motorola closing at just under $16.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Moving to tonight's tech watch: a makeover for Micron Electronics -- the company today abandoning its lagging PC business. Micron is far from a major PC player but this is no small decision. Ninety-seven percent of Micron's sales come from PC's, and that was a billion-dollar business last year.</p><p>Micron Electronics, in fact, will no longer exist.  The company is buying Atlanta-based Interland, and the new company will be known as Interland.  The transformed firm will be 100-percent focused on the Internet, and will become the nation's third-largest Web-hosting provider.  Micron fell fractionally in trading today, but a makeover may be just what the company needs.  It's stock is off 81 percent over the past year.</p><p>BAY: Just ahead, farmers worry over the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe, as officials warn half of Britain's livestock could be at risk.</p><p>Plus, as the California electricity crisis grinds on, we'll check out some of the real-life victims of the power squeeze.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERNOFF: The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease across the Atlantic may be getting much worse.  British officials today said it may be months before the situation is under control, and scientists warned up to half of Britain's 63 million livestock may have to be slaughtered if the spread cannot be stopped.</p><p>Concerns about another animal disease reaching U.S. shores: Authorities in Texas said they would put to death 22 cows imported from Germany to test for mad cow disease.</p><p>BAY: A different kind of crisis has California in its grip: the power crunch that forced regulators to impose rolling blackouts earlier this week.</p><p>The financial impact of the crisis continues to spread.  Small power generators, which mostly produce so-called green power, have not been paid by the state's nearly-bankrupt electric utilities.  As a result, many face serious financial troubles of their own, and some have been forced to shut down.  That is contributing to blackouts and even shortchanging schools.</p><p>Casey Wian has the story from Imperial County, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's career day at Calipatria High School.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you work with your mind and you work with your body.</p><p>WIAN: Students pay close attention.  They know jobs here are scarce.  Imperial County, located inland along the Mexican border, is by most measures California's poorest county, with unemployment exceeding 30 percent.  Now the largely agricultural community faces a new threat: California's energy crisis.</p><p>The Calipatria school district gets 72 percent of its revenue from the property taxes of a single company, geothermal power producer, CalEnergy.  And the company says this time it doesn't have the money to pay, nearly $4 million due April 10th.  That's because CalEnergy hasn't been paid by its biggest customer, Southern California Edison, in nearly five months.</p><p>Calipatria High is in the midst of a rebuilding program.  Its classrooms have structural problems, so students will soon move into these temporary portable classrooms -- and these even older rooms. But uncertainty over tax revenue is jeopardizing the county's ability to pay for improvements.</p><p>JIM HANKS, CALIPATRIA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT: Long-term, as far as property bonds for new facilities that were in planning stages and preparing for is put on hold.  And it could have a major impact, not only on the facilities, but also on the students' education.</p><p>WIAN: CalEnergy's local suppliers, such as welding contractor Jason Turner, are also suffering because the company is delaying their payments.</p><p>JASON TURNER, PERFORMANCE MECHANICAL CONTRACTORS: We were once considered a stable company, now we're living pretty much week-to- week, struggling to meet the payroll.</p><p>WIAN: Southern California Edison owes CalEnergy $140 million for electricity supplied since November, says CalEnergy's parent company.</p><p>DAVID SOKOL, MIDAMERICAN ENERGY HOLDINGS: We've tried to keep the lights on in California.  But the reality is, Edison's getting paid every day for our power, their rates come in every day.  They've accumulated now $2 billion in cash, but they haven't paid us a dime.</p><p>WIAN: While CalEnergy has continued to produce power without getting paid, several other renewable, or green, power producers have been forced to shut down.  They provide 12 percent of California's power, and are owed more than a half billion dollars.</p><p>(on camera): Without the financial squeeze, renewable energy producers say they could have generated enough power to save California from this week's statewide rolling blackouts.</p><p>(voice-over): Utilities dispute that claim.  Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E both say they want to pay their creditors, but are restricted by their own financial problems.  California Governor Gray Davis has announced plans to force utilities to pay renewable energy producers in advance for the power they receive in the future.</p><p>And Thursday, a judge gave CalEnergy the right to break its contract with Edison and sell power elsewhere.  Its parent company has now pledged to make the property tax payment to Imperial County.  But officials here, and in eight other California counties facing tax shortages from renewable energy producers, say the continuing financial uncertainty could hurt students for years.

And it will remain elusive, analysts say, until tech earnings stop their decline and turn around.</p><p>ASHOK KUMAR, US BANCORPPIPER JAFFREY: There is increased possibility that instead of recovery in the second half of this year, we could be looking into a recession.  And if that's the case, we have not seen the worst of the stock market.</p><p>FRANCIS: The tech earnings outlook continues to get dimmer. According the first call, tech company preannouncements are running 77 percent ahead of the fourth quarter's record-setting pace.  And 81 percent of those preannouncements are negative, also a record.</p><p>Those warnings are cutting deep in projections.  Originally, analysts expected first-quarter tech earnings to increase 4 percent. Now they're expecting a huge 32-percent decline.  For the second quarter, projections for a 2 percent increase have turned into a 30- percent decline.  For the third quarter, an 11-percent increase has turned into an 18-percent decrease.  And it gets worse.</p><p>CHUCK HILL, FIRST CALL/THOMSON FINANCIAL: In the last two weeks, it's spilled over into the fourth quarter.  Just in a couple weeks, we've gone from 15 percent growth expected in the fourth quarter, down to 6. FRANCIS: With timid consumers and corporations, and tapped-out telecoms and dot-coms, tech spending is in the doldrums.</p><p>HILL: So whether the Fed does a half a point or three quarters of a point, is immaterial to these kind of problems.</p><p>FRANCIS: Another layer of concern for tech companies: the strong dollar, which makes high-tech exports pricey, just where tech companies are looking for growth.</p><p>KUMAR: For a company such as Intel and Compaq and Dell -- a lot of the large IT companies -- they get over 60 percent of their revenue from the international market.  So Europe represents 40 percent of their revenue.  And then Japan and Asia-Pacifics, all those currencies are weak against the dollar.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: Now, when it comes to Intel, Kumar doesn't think the chip giant will again reach its 1999 revenue levels until 2003.</p><p>That's a long, rough road back.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Certainly is.

The anxiety is evident in almost any discussion about the stock market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm nervous about the market.  I'm nervous with interests rates dropping and stock market still dropping.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is definitely a worry when you see it going in red for so long.

CHERNOFF: It's a withdrawal from an addiction to fast money, argues Dr. Barry Lubetkin, a Manhattan psychologist who says clients are complaining more about the stock market than at any point in his 30-year career.</p><p>DR. BARRY LUBETKIN, INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIOR THERAPY: They're frightened.  They're uncomfortable.  They're confused.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Lubetkin describes a four-stage mourning process which he believes investors are suffering through.  First: denial, refusing to believe that one's stocks can keep falling.  Second: anger, with investment advisers and with one's self for not selling.  Then, depression, and finally, acceptance.</p><p>LUBETKIN: Most of the people right now are at somewhere between the denial and the anger stage.  They're angry because they feel that they've been ill-advised, but at the same time, many of them are denying that we really are in a bear market.</p><p>Some are beginning to move into the depression stage.  I've had several patients who've come to me who've said that they really feel that they really need antidepressant medication, because they're obsessing about their losses.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Other psychologists report their clients are further along, having reached the final acceptance stage.</p><p>DR. RICHARD GEIST, PRESIDENT, INSTITUTE OF PSYCHOLOGY AND INVESTING: People at this point are in that state of feeling, I don't care anymore, and that usually corresponds with a bottom in the market.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Markets are a function of group psychology, and strategists agree, when investor emotion falls to the acceptance stage, they argue it's usually a positive sign for stocks, because the worst of the selling has already occurred.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: Psychologist Robert Leahy is telling his clients in Manhattan to put it all in perspective, thinking of your life in balance -- meaningful work, good friendships, health, and stock holdings, Dr. Leahy says, are only one part of it -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Allan, we'll try to remember that.  Balance.</p><p>With more on the outlook for stocks and how to deal with these wild markets, we turn to Scott Black, he's the president of Delphi Management, in tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus.\"</p><p>Scott, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>SCOTT BLACK, PRESIDENT, DELPHI MANAGEMENT: Thank you, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Investors today seem to believe that the rally that began yesterday was somewhat convincing.  How convincing do you think it was?</p><p>BLACK: I'm not a technician, but I don't think it's convincing. Because the fact is that the stock market is not uncoupled from the economy.</p><p>I'd like to say this first: the Alan Greenspan moved too little. Instead of 50 basis points, he really should have given us the psychological boost of 75 basis points.</p><p>And also, we need fiscal stimulus in a hurry.  In every recession since 1946, the consumer has led the way out.  And so, what we need is a 1962 John F. Kennedy type of tax cut that hits the middle and low middle class immediately with disposable income.  And until these types of things eventuate, I don't see corporate earnings and the economy coming back too quickly.</p><p>BAY: Given that somewhat bearish outlook, what should investors be doing here?</p><p>BLACK: Well, firstly, if they have fresh money, they may just want to sit on the sideline in cash equivalents.  I always like to say it's better to be a couple of days late than to stand in front of the tidal wave.</p><p>Otherwise, you do what we try to do at Delphi, which is buy value stocks.  Companies -- not the Oracles, not the Ciscos or the Dells, which are still 20 to 30 times expected earnings, but buy companies where there are good fundamentals, like energy prices, perhaps regional banks or some insurance companies, where you can buy them at seven and eight P/Es.</p><p>BAY: Give us some specific names, if you would, for example\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACK: OK, in the energy field -- OK, in the insurance company -- Meridian is selling at seven times earning, it's a municipal bond insurer.  Commerce Group here in Webster, Mass. is eight times earning.  IPC Holdings, which is on 24.4 percent by AIG is selling below book, it's still only 8 1/2 times earning, it's a Bermuda re- insurer.</p><p>This way, you're not going to get clobbered by fundamentals sinking quickly, and also you are not overpaying for the thrill of the game.</p><p>BAY: Scott Black, thanks for joining us.  Thanks for that advice.</p><p>BLACK: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE: the bond market is getting a major boost from the recent sell-off in equities, but how long will this strength last? We'll talk bonds next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHERNOFF: In tonight's \"Sector Report\": bonds.  Treasury prices slipped today, but the bond market has been thriving, as stock prices have been in the tank.  The indexes for treasuries, municipal and corporate bonds are all up this year, as investors have been scrambling for the safety of fixed income returns.</p><p>For more on the sector, we're joined by right now by Bill Sullivan, he's fixed income strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Bill, great to see you.</p><p>WILLIAM SULLIVAN, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: Yes, good evening, Allan.</p><p>CHERNOFF: OK, so we did see a move out of bonds today as the stock market rose.  Let's say that the market keeps rising, the stock market next week.  What will happen to the bond market?</p><p>SULLIVAN: Oh, that's a real challenging environment for fixed income securities, and especially treasuries.  There's no doubt the bond market has benefited from a flow of funds out of equities into fixed income product for safety, liquidity and income purposes.  If we get a bounce back, a convincing bounce back in the equity market, you are going to reverse that flow and there's going to be some mild upward pressures on interests rates.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Bill, how attractive are bonds right now for the individual investor?  What sort of yields are we getting?</p><p>SULLIVAN: Extraordinary attractive outside the treasury area. In our retail desk, there's been particular interest from our customer base in high-grade corporates in the seven-to-10-year area.  A fair range of return in that maturity sector is about 6 1/2 to 6 3/4 right now.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Which looks pretty good, compared to what the stock market has been doing.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Absolutely.  There's a new focus by investors on asset allocation, risk diversification and -- hallelujah! -- capital preservation, and bonds fit the trick.  We are having a record year in bonds, because of so much customer interest.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Bill, let's talk about the Fed briefly.  Chairman Greenspan got a lot of heat this week.  Many investors saying, the guy is behind the curve.  Is he really?</p><p>SULLIVAN: Possibly yes, but keep in mind that the three rate drops totaling 150 basis rats represents aggressive accommodation in historical terms.  And keep in mind, he left the window open for additional rate cuts before too long.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Three rate cuts since the beginning of the year.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Absolutely, 150 basis points in a matter of 2 1/2 months.  That's an aggressive drop.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Bill Sullivan, thanks much.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Thank you.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Willow.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on \"MONEYLINE,\" the evolution of the movie theater.  Some radical changes may be on the horizon.  We'll wrap up our special look at the business of Hollywood next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: All week we've been gearing up for Sunday night's Oscars by looking at the business of Hollywood.  Earlier we examined a looming strike by writers.  And tonight we look at another challenge: the peril facing the nation's theater chains.  A digital revolution, which may leave some theater operators bruised and bloodied.  But make no mistake, it's coming to a multiplex near you.  Fred Katayama has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM HANKS, ACTOR: Anybody!</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Like the Tom hanks' character in the Oscar-nominated film \"Cast Away, \" many theater operators are fighting to stay afloat.  Several big movie exhibition chains like the parents of Loews', United Artists and General Cinemas filed for Chapter 11.  They had built too many new megaplex theaters and took on too much debt as fewer people went to the cinema.  They're busy closing down older theaters as they rework their finances.  The stock of GC companies is down more than 90 percent from its 52-week high.  So is Loews.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Since screen closures are tied to leases, you can only move as quickly as you can close down the facilities or get out of the leases, and that's kind of holding up the pace of the transition.  I think it's going to take another 18 months to maybe 24, 30 months before we kind of see a light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Analysts say consolidation could shrink the 10 big theater operators down to five or six.  Those remaining could engineer a revolution.</p><p>ANDREW LIPMAN, ENTERTAINMENT ANALYST: I think the industry is going to change more in the next five years than it's changed in the last 75.</p><p>KATAYAMA: He's referring to digitalization.  Thirty theaters in the U.S. are experimenting with digital projectors.  Digital copies of celluloid eliminate the hisses, pops, lines and hairs seen on film reels today.  What's more, digital systems could liberate theater owners from showing not just movies, but live events, like boxing matches, Broadway shows and the Super Bowl.  That would give exhibition companies new sources of revenue.  Studios would use a satellite up link, as in this example, or fiber lines to transmit digitally-compressed movies to theaters.  The movies are decompressed, then shown with a digital projector.  The big issue: who'll pay for this? Digital projectors cost as much as $150, 000, five times the cost of current ones.  Outfitting all domestic screens would cost anywhere from $3.5 billion to $5.5 billion.</p><p>(on camera): The theater operators say the studios should pay for the projectors, since they would benefit the most, saving about $1 billion a year in the cost of printing and transporting reels.  The theater operators do not have the money.</p><p>(voice-over): Some analysts speculate digital cinema is a big reason telecom investors are jumping in.  Gary Winnick, the founder of Global Crossing, has teamed up with other investors to buy a stake in Loews, while Philip Anschutz, the founder of Qwest Communications, has invested in UA and Regal Cinemas.  Others are entering the digital scene.  Transmission players like Boeing and Williams Communications and digital chip maker Texas Instruments.  Last November, AMC theaters tied up with Walt Disney and TI, among others, to distribute the Miramax film \"Bounce\" using Boeing's satellite system.  All this comes as broadband companies race to provide fast Internet connections that would allow consumers to watch digital movies on demand at home.</p><p>JOHN FITHIAN, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEATRE OWNERS: When the studios release their movies, they send them to theaters first because theaters are the social experience.  It's where kids can go out on a date.  It's where you can hear if the person in your aisle is laughing or crying to the film and relate to your fellow human beings as you're watching a movie.  We believe the movie theater experience will always stay first above entertainment experiences in the home.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"GLADIATOR\")</p><p>RUSSELL CROWE, ACTOR: At my signal, unleash hell.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATAYAMA: Those cinemas that survive the Darwinian battle, analysts say, could go fully digital in about five years.  Fred Katayama, CNN financial news, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: Up next, \"Ahead of the Curve.\" Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Taking a look at some of what could make headlines on Wall Street next week.

After plunging into bear market territory just days ago, the Dow has staged a remarkable comeback.  Today the index jumped 182 points, or nearly 2 percent, from the session low on Thursday.  The index has soared nearly 600 points.  No rally for the Nasdaq today, which lost 10 points to end at 1,918.  And the S&amp;P was up 12 at 1,152, a gain of more than 1 percent.</p><p>CHERNOFF: The key question now for investors: Is this Dow rally for real?  Over the past year, the Nasdaq has had more than its share of so-called \"bear market rallies,\" essentially short term pops with no follow-through.</p><p>Greg Clarkin looks at whether the Dow's recent comeback is built to last.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The news was uplifting to the bulls.  Back-to-back gains for the blue chips for the first time in more than two weeks.  A triple-digit rally that pumped life back into some of the casualties of the recent sell-off.  But is it for real or just another false start?  Investors and analysts have been scrambling to try to find an answer.</p><p>Many Wall Street pros say last week's sell-off on the Dow, which drove the blue chips into bear market territory at one point, left many Dow stocks dramatically undervalued, levels low enough to prove irresistible to buyers.</p><p>TRACY EICHLER, UBSPAINEWEBBER: What we are seeing on the Dow and the S&amp;P today actually seems to be sideline money coming in. Where, last week we saw a short covering into the Nasdaq indices; and tonight we are hearing from our floor brokers that they are actually seeing more money coming into those indices.</p><p>CLARKIN: A look at the Dow's biggest winners shows a rebound in last week's big losers: United Technologies, Boeing, Merck, Philip Morris, and Wal-Mart all gained.</p><p>But beyond bargain hunting, analysts say there's still a long way to go before they are convinced that this rally can be sustained.  The corporate profit picture needs to improve and the economy needs to rebound.</p><p>RICHARD CRIPPS, LEGG MASON: We could have a very significant rally here, 10 to 15 percent.  The question of it being sustained or not is really going to have to do with the investors gaining confidence that earnings growth is going to -- is near the bottom and that it will resume at some point in the future and what that growth rate will be.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: As for short term indicators, Wall Street is watching the advance decline line and volume figures very closely.  Now, winning stocks easily beat out losing stocks today, but the volume was considered light, and analysts say that needs to pick up if this rally is to build any kind of momentum -- Allan.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Greg, do you think that we are seeing a sentiment shift here?</p><p>CLARKIN: Nobody is willing to call that just yet.  They say they want to see a shift in the fundamentals first before they jump out to there. CHERNOFF: Greg Clarkin, thank you.</p><p>Well, 25 of the Dow 30 closed higher today.  In addition to the winners that Greg did mention: GM, Home Depot and IBM were all higher. But other tech blue chips, Microsoft and Intel, ended lower.</p><p>Nasdaq losers also included QLogic, PMC-Sierra -- hit following a profit warning -- Veritas Software, Dell and Apple computer.</p><p>BAY: Nearly all of those stocks are well off their highs, victims of a fierce bear market sell-off that's become headline news across the nation.  But there's one pocket of America where bullish sentiment is still alive and well: Wall Street.  Peter Viles reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The news media is turning out one ominous headline after another, but major Wall Street analysts are still writing a bullish story.  A bit less bullish perhaps.  Today J.P. Morgan's Doug Cliggott reduced his year-end fair value target for the S&amp;P 500 from 1,400 to 1,300.  But that's still a 12.8 percent gain from today's close.</p><p>Lehman's Jeff Applegate also cut his target from: 1,600 to 1,400. But that is still a gain of 21 percent.  Al Goldman is also bullish in the face of bearish headlines; he sees the S&amp;P at 1,400 at year end.</p><p>AL GOLDMAN, A.G. EDWARDS: It's positive, believe it or not, that the front page of \"Time\" Magazine, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" feature articles in the \"New York Times\" and the local paper had nothing but great big growling bears.  By the time that the media starts to cover it that extensively, usually the worst of the bear market is over.</p><p>VILES: Wall Street is still dominated by Super Bowls: Abbey Joseph Cohen of Goldman and Joe Battipaglia of Gruntal both the S&amp;P 500 go to 1,650, a gain of 43 percent.  Christine Callies of Merrill Lynch sees a 41 percent gain.  Tom Galvin of C.S. First Boston, 31 percent.</p><p>But what if they are all wrong?</p><p>Bill Fleckenstein doesn't make predictions, but he says that the S&amp;P could easily revisit its 1997 lows in the 700s; regardless of what major strategists predict.</p><p>BILL FLECKENSTEIN, FLECKENSTEIN CAPITAL: I think that you can expect Wall Street to kind of ride it out and be wrong.  I have been in the business for 20 years and I can only remember one time when the majority of Wall Street analysts were bearish and it was at the lows in 1984, they were all bearish just before the market turned.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: Fleckenstein's argument is simple.  S&amp;P 500 valuations, at 22 times last years's earnings, are still well above the levels typically seen during the bear markets.  And it is quite possible that earnings will fall this year.</p><p>CHERNOFF: But a lot of those bulls don't seem very concerned. Peter Viles, thank you.</p><p>Aside from tech profit concerns, investors today were also assessing the latest economic news; this time from the housing market. Sales of both new and previously-owned homes declined in February. Fewer buyers were willing to step up in the face of an ailing economy and a swooning stock market.  Lisa Leiter reports from Chicago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISA LEITER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Last year, business was never better for realtor Elizabeth Ballis.  Strong demand and short supply of homes on the market.  What a difference six months makes.</p><p>ELIZABETH BALLIS, COLDWELL BANKER: The fact that is the stock market has been so difficult and that the interest rates, although they are low, the buyers are feeling nervous because there's been a lot of depreciation, and they don't to the buy it at the top of the market.</p><p>Ballis is on target.  Judging by the latest reports of the housing market.  New home sales in February plunged more than 18 percent here in the Midwest.  Nationwide, they fell 2.4 percent with increases in the Northeast and the South off setting the declines in the West and Midwest.  Sales of previously-owned homes also fell slightly.  But less than expected.  This time, it was the West and Midwest posted gains with the Northeast and South suffering the most. Still, the overall pace of home sales remains relatively strong.</p><p>DAVID LEREAH, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS: The primary factor is low interest rates.  Mortgage rates have been coming down for the last year.  They're over a full percentage point down.  That's making homes more affordable.</p><p>LEITER: Indeed, last week, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 6.9 percent, the lowest level in almost two years. Economists say the relatively low unemployment rate and stable personal income also has helped propped up the housing market but the steady drum beat of bad news on Main Street and on Wall Street could threaten its resiliency.</p><p>KATHLEEN CAMILLI, TUCKER ANTHONY: If the layoff numbers and the downward revisions to earnings continue, then that probably bodes ill for the housing sector down the road.</p><p>LEITER: The bright side is that the mortgages can be even cheaper as the bond market anticipates more interest rate cuts by the Fed.  Economists predict that could not only draw in new buyers, but also add to the already rising number of people refinancing their mortgages.</p><p>Lisa Leiter, CNN financial news, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: And the Fed is getting mediocre grades from a group of previously staunch supporters: business economists.  The National Association for Business Economics released a survey stating that one third of economists think the Fed is keeping too tight a grip on interest rates.  The survey, which was taken before last week's half point rate cut, showed: 34 percent of those polled said that monetary policy was too restrictive, 56 percent think the Fed is doing its job just right, but that approval rating is down from 76 percent last August and the lowest approval rating in five years.</p><p>Mr. Greenspan face some of those criticisms tomorrow morning when he speaks to the NABE in Washington.</p><p>BAY: Johnson &amp; Johnson is reportedly on the verge of its biggest takeover ever, for drug maker Alza.  Tonight the \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that the boards of both companies have approved an $11.8 billion stock swap, which values Alza at $41.84 a share.  The deal reportedly has a fixed exchange ratio and no collar.  Today Johnson &amp; Johnson shares sunk while Alza shares took-off.  That trend continued after hours as well: J&amp;J down another: $2; Alza added on another $.35. Shares were up nearly $9 in regular trading.</p><p>CHERNOFF: April, of course, is known as the cruelest month.  But for the Dow Industrials, March may come in a close second.  The Dow has plunged this month coming just points away from a full-fledged bear market.  The index emerged from bear territory in recent days, a two session gain of more than 3 percent.  Let's go to Terry Keenan at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Terry, what would you say people are attributing this rally to?</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, what do they say, Allan? In like a lion, out like a lamb.  That, at least, is the way the Dow Jones Industrials seem to be wrapping up this month.  But today, pretty much just good old-fashioned buying momentum.  We're up 581 points since the Dow hit bottom at 9,106.  That was on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Today, the momentum continued, despite the fact that the tech stocks in the Dow 30 didn't really help out.  Instead, the buying was in the big old-fashioned industrial names.  United Technologies is the standout, up seven percent.  We also saw a lot of buying in 3M and in Boeing today.  But really, rather light volume, a lot of traders saying that the big portfolio managers have kind of wrapped up their quarter, squared out their positions over the last couple of weeks. They're also waiting to hear from Alan Greenspan, when he does speak to the National Association of Business Economists, come tomorrow morning -- Allan?</p><p>CHERNOFF: And, Terry, what about all this discussion in Washington about an immediate tax cut -- is that helping at all?</p><p>KEENAN: Well, you know, there is of course a lot of interest here in seeing the tax cuts accelerated and to see some immediate tax relief.  And in fact, when we did get word of a possible $60 billion surplus rebate on Thursday afternoon, that did coincide with the turnaround here in the market.</p><p>But most of the time, traders are saying that $60 billion is just a drop in the bucket, particularly given the wealth destruction that we've seen in the market in the last couple of months.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Terry Keenan at the big board, thank you.  Willow?</p><p>BAY: Allan, ahead on MONEYLINE: an about-face from the Treasury Secretary on the fortune he made in corporate America.  What pushed Paul O'Neill to say he'll sell off his stock?</p><p>Plus, we'll talk with Senator Joe Lieberman: his plan to plow money back into taxpayer pockets.  Would it jump-start the economy?</p><p>And later, the football venture that definitely needs some cheerleading: XFL getting tackled in prime time.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUSH: I believe the economy has slowed down, and we better do something about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAY: President Bush in Kansas City, Missouri, today, pushing for his tax cut proposal.  The president said with the right steps, the economy could get back to past growth rates.  The president later today continued his trip to Montana.  He will visit Michigan tomorrow before he returns to Washington, D.C.</p><p>A popular proposal to get the economy back on track: an immediate tax cut.  Both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are talking up the prospect of a $60 billion cut this year.</p><p>Former vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman today suggested issuing that 60 billion as a kind rebate.  The Democratic senator called for giving every tax payer a $300 check.  payer a $300 check. For more, we're joined from Capitol Hill by Senator Lieberman.</p><p>Senator, welcome.</p><p>SEN. JOE LIEBERMAN (D), CONNECTICUT: Good to be with you, Willow.  Thank you.</p><p>BAY: So why is this $300 rebate the right way to give this economy a little bit of a quick boost?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yeah, I think the important thing to say is that we are obviously going through a slowdown, and that ultimately it will be the economy itself that will reinvigorate itself.  That's always been the strength in America.  But the government can help somewhat through the Federal Reserve with monetary policy.  And I think, through the Congress and the Federal government, through fiscal stimulus. How did we get to $60 billion?  That's what most economists tell us is the minimum rational number necessary to have any effect on the economy.  And then the question is, how do you get it out to the people as quick as possible?  And it just seemed to me that the best thing we could do, particularly if we want taxpayers to spend it, is to send out a rebate check.</p><p>To take the 60 billion, which is about two-thirds of what -- we're pretty confident we'll be left over in the Federal budget as of September 30th when we close our books.  Divide that 60 billion by the almost-200 million taxpayers in America.  Income tax, payroll tax, any Federal tax, and you come out with about $300 per taxpayer.  And I think we can cut a check, if we can get it passed, send it out to taxpayers within a month or two.</p><p>BAY: That's, of course, a big \"if.\"</p><p>Let me ask you, though, a question\u2026</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It is a big \"if.\"</p><p>BAY: \u2026 about -- we'll get to that in a minute -- about the issue of rebates.  There is a fair amount of momentum, it seems, for a quick tax break for Americans.  There is a fair amount of opposition to this notion, though, of a rebate -- that it will not work, that taxpayers need to see a long-term change in their income to really start spending again.</p><p>What do you say to that?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Well, I think we've got two problems here, two opportunities.  The first is, what can we do quickly on a one-time basis to create some fiscal stimulus?  And that's why I proposed this $300 per taxpayer rebate, getting it out in a check as quickly as possible from the expected surplus at the end of this year.</p><p>Beyond that, we've got to be fiscally responsible and decide what's -- what can we best do to get the economy going and keep the growth going? And that's where, in my remarks today at George Washington University, I was critical of President Bush, because I think his tax plan is just a tax plan.  It's not a prosperity plan. There's no argument here for continuing the growth that we've had.</p><p>And I think to do that, we have to first stay fiscally responsible, not overspend.  Second, invest in things like education, research and development.  But third, focus those tax cuts, in my opinion, on incentives to business, to help business invest and grow. And I'm talking about further capital gains tax reduction, and accelerated depreciation for investments in the business.  Even a zero capital gains tax for investment on a small start-up business that you hold for a period of time.</p><p>BAY: Senator, let me ask you -- you mentioned it a moment, about the \"what if.\"</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yes. BAY: What are the odds that a proposal like this, or even one of the alternative proposals that are similar, gets through Congress separate and distinct from President Bush's tax cut plan.  Is that even a possibility?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: I think if we want a short-term stimulus to have any positive effect on our economy, right now, as it slows, we've got to separate it from the longer term judgments on President Bush's tax plan, or anybody else's tax plan.  Because if we allow this stimulus to be held hostage to that drawn-out debate, we're never going to do it in time.  So, I think in fairness we have to separate it.</p><p>BAY: OK, I understand the rationale behind separating it.  But, realistically, how big a fight do you have on your hands?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: I think it's a battle, but I think the outcome is not clear because the logic of separating the short-term stimulus -- whatever it is, whether it's my idea of a rebate, or somebody else's idea of a quick drop in marginal rates, perhaps at the bottom, or more broadly -- that ought to be separated from the longer-term debate.</p><p>And I think we have a fair chance to win that argument.  I am in a bipartisan, centrist coalition and we're talking very much along those lines right now.</p><p>BAY: Senator, we know there's a lot of talking going on.  The debate surely will continue next week.</p><p>Senator Lieberman, thank you for joining us.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Thanks, Willow, it was a pleasure.</p><p>BAY: Allan?</p><p>CHERNOFF: Up next on MONEYLINE, a pilot strike keeps Comair's fleet on the ground.</p><p>And why Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill finally agreed to sell millions upon millions of Alcoa stock.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERNOFF: An airline strike to report: pilots at Comair, the regional airline owned by Delta, have walked out, forcing Comair to cancel all flights today and tomorrow.  Comair is the nation's second largest regional carrier, and contract negotiations between pilots and management have been going on for three years.</p><p>Comair president Randy Rademacher told CNN earlier today, there just wasn't room for compromise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RANDY RADEMACHER, PRESIDENT, COMAIR: We went into the negotiations this weekend, but we were prepared to compromise to discuss the issues when we got there, and the union was very clear. They told us that the offer they had on the table back in February stands.  There was no room to compromise.</p><p>They put us in a position where, frankly, the decision at the table was very easy.  The hard decision started being made when we had to start dealing with our customers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHERNOFF: The strike could affect as many as 25,000 passengers a day, but President Bush, who intervened to halt a strike by Northwest mechanics just two weeks ago, says Comair will have to solve the problem on its own.  Right now, both sides say they're willing to talk again.  In spite of the strike, Delta finished higher today, along with other airline shares.</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"Tech Watch\": surfing the Web from 35,000 feet.

We'll tell you why he's prepared to sell now.</p><p>And later, is California on the verge of a rate hike for power? And would it be enough to solve the Golden State's power crunch?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERNOFF: A major about-face for a key member of the Bush administration.  Not over policy but assets.  Steve Young has the story from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In his Alcoa years, he was the king of the aluminum.  In the Bush administration, Paul O'Neill has been a lightning rod.  To put out the sparks, the Treasury secretary now says he will sell his $100 million in Alcoa's holdings.</p><p>PAUL O'NEILL, SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: I have decided to take this issue off the table.</p><p>YOUNG: Critics said that owning the stock could affect O'Neill's judgment and applaud the decision, although they say it's a little late.</p><p>LAWRENCE NOBLE, CENTER FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS: It's a good decision.  Obviously, we would hope that cabinet appointees would make these decisions from the beginning.</p><p>YOUNG: The Treasury secretary hasn't said how soon he plans to complete the sale of nearly 2.5 million of shares of stock and four million options.  But analysts say it shouldn't pull the price of the stock down.</p><p>ALBERTO ARRIAS, GOLDMAN SACHS: I am sure that Mr. O'Neill would not sell it all at once.  It's very likely that it will be done over a period of time.  So, I do not think on a trading -- from a trading point of view, it's going to have an impact.</p><p>YOUNG: Others have grappled with the impact of their day job on their portfolios.  Vice President Dick Cheney sold his stock in Halliburton, the oil company he led until last summer.  And secretary O'Neill's predecessor, Robert Rubin, cut ties to his former firm Goldman Sachs by establishing a blind trust.</p><p>A treasure department spokesman says she believes Rubin was required to by government ethicists, but Rubin told CNNFN, he did that on his own.</p><p>(on camera): So, why is O'Neill shifting gears now?

We'll track today's market action for you.</p><p>CHERNOFF: And despite all the hype, the XFL Football League has watched its ratings spiral since its debut.  Are the league's days numbered?  We'll have a look when MONEYLINE continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE.</p><p>CHERNOFF: In tonight's headlines, a solid rally for blue chips, the Dow gaining nearly 2 percent on the session.

Why can't the league score a touchdown with viewers?</p><p>BAY: But first, more on tonight's top story: a bounce for blue chips and a weak day for techs.  For the second session in a row, the Dow finished in the plus column, climbing by as much as 220 points earlier in the day.  In the end, the Dow gained 182 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 9,687.</p><p>Checking out some of the big Dow winners, United Technologies, Merck, Boeing, 3M, and Wal-Mart all gaining on the day.  A strong day for the S&amp;P 500 as well.  The index finished up 12 points to 1,152.</p><p>The Nasdaq was not as fortunate.  The index struggled to hold onto early gains, and in the end it closed down 10 points at 1,918.</p><p>CHERNOFF: A pair of profit warnings today from chip-makers.  For the second time this quarter, PMC-Sierra says it will fall short of Wall Street estimates, blaming weak demand.  As a result, the chip- maker says it will cut 13 percent of its work force.  That is 230 workers.</p><p>PMCS is not alone.  Chip-maker Conexant also warned sales will fall by up to 40 percent for the latest quarter.  The company says it will lay off 20 percent of its work force.  That is 1,500 jobs.</p><p>Both companies fell on the news.  Shares of PMC-Sierra finished off $1.68.  Conexant down fractionally at 10 1/2.</p><p>The rough session for those chip-makers weighed heavily on other semiconductor stocks.  The sector has recently attracted a lot of attention on Wall Street, as many investors look to chips as an important measure of the market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF (voice-over): Traders are watching semiconductor stocks very closely for signs of a possible turn in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. While semiconductor stocks fell today, they posted big gains last week.</p><p>The most widely followed measure of the semis is the Philadelphia semiconductor index, with 16 stocks, known by its ticker symbol S-O-X, SOX.  Last week, the SOX rose 19 percent, leading some to suspect a Nasdaq rally might be coming.</p><p>ART HOGAN, JEFFERIES &amp; COMPANY: The semiconductor index is very important for investors to watch, because it historically, with 90 percent accuracy, has always predicted a turnaround in the markets. Whenever we've had a sell-off, a major sell-off, the semiconductors have been the first cycle or the first group to lead us out of the bottom.  And we saw this pattern forming last week.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Semiconductors are in almost all major technology products: wireless phones, data networking equipment, and personal computers.  So business at semiconductor companies reflects a broad range of the tech industry.  And semiconductor stocks tend to lead the Nasdaq.</p><p>JOHN ROQUE, ARNHOLD &amp; S. BLEICHROEDER: People have an affinity for these stocks, and they know a lot about them, and I think in many respects the commodity themselves, if we could look at chips as commodities, gives us some sort of insight as to which direction the market is moving and how quickly it's moving in that direction.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Last year the SOX index led the Nasdaq down, losing more than half its value from September through the end of November. The Nasdaq composite followed.  The SOX perked up in late December, and again, the Nasdaq followed in January, but it turned out to be a bear market rally.</p><p>Analysts say it's best to use the SOX as one of several bellwethers for the Nasdaq.  Another that's widely followed, the stock of Cisco Systems, which is sending a very negative sign, having fallen to a new 52-week low today.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: Many tech investors are certainly hoping the semiconductors will be a leading indicator for the Nasdaq.  So far this year, the SOX index is up more than 7 percent while the Nasdaq composite is down 22 percent.</p><p>Among the Wall Street pros keeping a close eye on the SOX index is Todd Eberhard.  He runs his own investment firm here in New York.</p><p>Todd, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>TODD EBERHARD, EBERHARD INVESTMENT ASSOCIATES: Good to be here.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Todd, we've just been talking about the SOX index.  We did pull back today after a very strong week last week.  What's the story?  Is it going to continue moving higher and will it lead the Nasdaq?</p><p>EBERHARD: Well, it's certainly not unusual to have some pullback after the week we had last week.  It doesn't surprise, I think, too many people.  The question now is where do we go forward or do we go backward from here.  At this point, I think we probably are going to play in somewhat of a trading range, but it is the index we're going to look at to hopefully lead us out or lead the Nasdaq out of this doldrum time we're having right now.</p><p>CHERNOFF: So are you not too worried about the kinds of earnings warnings that we've received today from Conexant, PMC-Sierra?</p><p>EBERHARD: I worry about everyplace.  But specifically, earnings warnings I think are now so expected by The Street.  Yes, we had some pullback in those stocks specifically on the warnings, but I think Wall Street is getting so used to hearing these companies warn for a second or third time per quarter, it's getting to be old news.  It's a question of what happens three months, six months down the road.</p><p>CHERNOFF: It's almost built into the market.</p><p>EBERHARD: To a great degree I think so.  And that's what we saw last week.  It's not -- people are starting finally to look forward, not backward, a little bit.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Sounds like we're talking about Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.  Those also were built into the market.</p><p>EBERHARD: That is absolutely true, and to some degree, maybe last Thursday, with the talk of that quick fix on the tax cut you were discussing earlier -- built into the market to some degree -- maybe started this rally off a little bit.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Todd, we know a lot of investors have been putting money into money market mutual funds, keeping their cash on the sidelines.  Do you see any sign that people are beginning to nibble here?</p><p>EBERHARD: I think a little bit of nibbling.  We've had more calls -- today actually we had more calls than we had almost all last week for trades of clients calling in to buy securities on their own. And we see that as an excellent sign of people hopefully realizing that we have hit, I'm not saying the bottom, but a bottom, where it's probably not a bad idea to start nibbling, putting your toe in if you're looking long term.</p><p>CHERNOFF: What looks tasty to you?</p><p>EBERHARD: Well, there's a lot of stocks out there, but we like companies like Nortel.  We like companies, believe it or not, like General Electric, which hit a 52-week low last week.  We think it's an excellent buy at these levels.  We're looking at other companies -- EMC is an example -- really good, strong companies.  The big names out there most people would recognize we're looking at for the future.</p><p>CHERNOFF: EMC, we just showed, down today.  Oracle, down today.</p><p>EBERHARD: Down today.</p><p>CHERNOFF: A lot of people say great company, but the stock can't seem to get off the floor.</p><p>EBERHARD: Well, it seems to be that point.  But as they say, when everything looks the worst it is, on Wall Street at least, it's time to start buying.  And we think it looks pretty bad right now, so it may be a good time to get in there.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Pretty bad, but not the worst?</p><p>EBERHARD: No.  I think we've seen the worst, but I do think it will play around here a little while.  But I think it's time to start just putting the toe in, get a little bit of cash off the sidelines and start taking a little bit of a step in.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Todd Eberhard, thank you.</p><p>EBERHARD: My pleasure.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Willow?</p><p>BAY: Allan, coming up on MONEYLINE, is Johnson &amp; Johnson close to scoring its biggest deal ever?

After the bell, though, Scholastic issued a statement saying the assets don't fit with its Internet strategy and it will not submit a final bid.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Other stocks in the headlines.  Chip-maker LSI-Logic is buying C-Cube Microsystems for $878 million in stock.  C-Cube makes chips used in home entertainment systems like DVDs, and LSI says the acquisition will bolster its multimedia entertainment business.</p><p>Let's check those stocks: LSI, down $2.65.  C-Cube jumped nearly five.</p><p>And Phelps Dodge, the world's second-largest copper-mining company, is cutting back production by 14 percent.  In a widely expected move, the company is slashing mining activities in New Mexico and Arizona in order to reduce its exposure to the uncertain California power market.  The stock fell fractionally to $40.60.</p><p>BAY: The California power crisis is tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus.\" California's top power regulator today proposed a controversial answer to the power crunch: raise electricity prices for residential customers.  That sent shares of the California utilities soaring.</p><p>The proposal came on the same day that PG&amp;E, one of the state's hard-hit utility companies, announced it may take a huge $4 billion charge to cover the cost of the power crunch.</p><p>Casey Wian joins us with more on this story -- Casey.</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, as most experts have predicted throughout the power crisis, it looks like the bill is finally coming due for the state's electricity users.  The head of California's public utilities commission today proposed increasing electricity rates by 36 percent.  That's on top of two rates already in the works. Big residential and business electricity users would be forced to pay the higher rates.  Those who could conserve could avoid bigger bills.</p><p>The move is designed to help ease the financial crisis facing the state's investor-owned utilities and to promote conservation in hopes of easing anticipated power shortages and blackouts this summer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LORETTA LYNCH, PRESIDENT, CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION: We recognize that the utilities are in severe financial distress.  The independent auditors confirm that.  In order for the utilities to keep the lights on and paying the qualifying facilities and paying the state of California for the power it produces, we have unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is needed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WIAN: If, as expected, the full commission approves the proposals, the rate hikes would generate about $2 1/2 billion a year for both Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.  The two utilities say they have lost a total of about $13 billion since last summer because they've been prevented from passing higher electricity costs onto customers.</p><p>On Wall Street, the parent companies of both utilities jumped about 30 percent.  PG&amp;E and Edison, however, both withheld comment, saying they're still studying the proposal.</p><p>But throughout the power crisis, California Governor Gray Davis at least publicly has remain opposed to rate increases.  His office issued a statement today, saying the governor has asked for more information on the proposed hikes.  The statement went on to say, \"It's still the governor's hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved without new rate hikes.\"</p><p>But Willow, Governor Davis may be one of the last people in California who believes that.</p><p>BAY: Yeah, that's for sure.  If this rate hike goes through, how much will it help?</p><p>WIAN: Well, the public utilities commission president says it should get the state through the summer without the need for anymore rate hikes.  But there are big issues still to deal with, such as the $10 billion bond offering.</p><p>The state's treasurer was on Wall Street today trying to pitch that.  By far not out of the woods yet.</p><p>BAY: Casey Wian, thanks.</p><p>Coming up on MONEYLINE, Terry Keenan joins us for tonight's \"Sector Report.\" Terry, what do you have for us? KEENAN: Well, Willow, chip stocks taking a major hit today. I'll speak with one analyst who's blasted numbers today and may not be done: Nathaniel Cohn of Goldman Sachs will be my guest when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: In tonight's \"Sector Focus,\" the chip stocks.  As we've been telling you, it was a rough trading session for many of the chip names, particularly the communication chip-makers.</p><p>My next guest cut his estimates today on names, including Applied Microcircuits, Broadcom, PMC-Sierra, Conexant and Vitesse.  Nathaniel Cohn of Goldman Sachs joins me now, and Nathaniel, welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>You cut your numbers on these stocks today.  You say you may have to cut them again tomorrow.  Business is just falling off a cliff. What's going on?</p><p>NATHANIEL COHN, GOLDMAN SACHS: Yeah, you have two issue.  You have demand side with customers like Cisco and Nortel having difficulties and citing that it's going to last a bit longer, and then you also have inventories which are -- have been built over a course of a couple of years to support what appeared to be endless demand.</p><p>And so really what you have is an inventory correction coupled with demand fall-off, which makes it very painful.</p><p>KEENAN: Exactly the opposite of what you want to have happen when you try to work off those inventories.</p><p>You know, a lot of investors last week rushed into the chip names, including the stocks that you follow, thinking that they'll be the first to recover.  Was that move into these stocks premature?</p><p>COHN: I think so.  I think in general you do see semiconductors lead out over the technology sector.  But the problem is that demand is very weak, and this is not probably like the prior cycle of '96 and '98, particularly for the communication chip companies.</p><p>So they're very high beta.  You tend to see a lot of money flow into them to catch the mood if you are feeling better about technology in general.  But I think it's too early.</p><p>KEENAN: High beta meaning that they're highly volatile.</p><p>COHN: Highly volatile, and you'll likely see, if the market does turn, you will see these names rise, but unfortunately, I think it's unsustainable at this point.</p><p>KEENAN: People fell in love with stocks, PMC-Sierra, Broadcom and the rest of them because they did just move up so high, so quickly.  How does their business differ from, say, an Intel?</p><p>COHN: Well, they're selling into communication markets that are really nascent.  They're driven by the Internet buildout, and it appeared like the demand again was endless, and the growth was pretty exceptional.  We were carrying estimates that counted for 50 percent growth this year, came in at 130 percent in the case of PMC-Sierra or Broadcom.  So the growth was there, so all the stocks were high and they were working.  The numbers were really coming through.</p><p>And you know, Intel is being driven more by the PC market, and you look at the end demand, and it's not as big of a driver.</p><p>But unfortunately right now, there's no place to hide.</p><p>KEENAN: So you're staying away from all the stocks that you follow right now.  What would make you a believer and a buyer again?</p><p>COHN: I think you'd need to see (UNINTELLIGIBLE) in the service providers.  I think those are going to be the leading indicators. When their orders start coming into companies like Nortel and Cisco, that'll be the leading indicator.</p><p>I think waiting for the chip companies to actually tell you that business is better is -- is -- you're going to miss half the rally. So, that's what we're looking for.</p><p>KEENAN: So watch the telecoms.</p><p>COHN: Absolutely.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks, Nathaniel.</p><p>COHN: Thanks very much.</p><p>KEENAN: Nathaniel Cohn -- Allan.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Coming up on MONEYLINE, a two-day rally for the Dow. Can the rebound continue?  Some market perspective from CNN's financial editor Myron Kandel and from money manager Todd Eberhard. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERNOFF: Can the Dow maintain it's upward momentum?  Joining me now, CNN's financial editor Myron Kandel, and Todd Eberhard, president of Eberhard Investment Associates.</p><p>Myron, what are you saying?  To keep on moving on the Dow?</p><p>MYRON KANDEL, CNNFN FINANCIAL EDITOR: Oh, yes.  You know, Thursday when the Dow hit its low, I said, that was it.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Down 380 points.</p><p>KANDEL: OK.  And since then, to today's close, the Dow is up 6.3 percent just over two days.  That's a major rally.  Obviously, it's not going to go straight up.  But I disagree with Todd just a bit.  He said we may have hit a low, may be not the low.  I think it's the low.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Calling an absolute bottom there. KANDEL: Right.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Very gutsy.  Todd, what do you say?</p><p>TODD EBERHARD, EBERHARD INVESTMENT ASSOCIATES: I like the way that you looked at me.  I hope that you are right; I would love to sit on your camp and say that it was the low.  We could test it again, unfortunately.  I hope that we do not.  The rally this fast back is sometimes indicative, at least in the last year of a quick sell-off and I hope that that doesn't happen.  But I do think you should start getting involved, as I said.</p><p>KANDEL: 580 points.  We have a bit of room to test the low without getting down that far.  I think that obviously we'll do a little testing but we won't go anywhere near where we were last Thursday.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Now Myron, you realize that a lot of the pros on Wall Street are saying that it could suffer more damage.  And the Nasdaq has been looking more strong and the Nasdaq, mainly, that's higher, the Down may be dragging down.</p><p>KANDEL: I disagree.  I think that the Dow goes higher and Nasdaq trails along.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Because people are looking for safer stocks?  Trying to stay away from a lot of the big tech names?</p><p>KANDEL: I think that they got really battered in those big tech names and they will come back, but not all at once.  They will do better in the Dow.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Todd, safer to go through the PMG, for example?</p><p>EBERHARD: That's one we talked about a long time ago.  It held up well; got beaten up on some earnings; has still held up dramatically well over a lot of the Nasdaq's positions.  But it's one of those things where I have to think that the people on Wall Street; a lot of pros are correct.  The Nasdaq got so beaten up and we saw a hold there where the Dow got beaten up.  I think we'll see a rebound. And the percentage terms that the Nasdaq is easier to go up more because it's so low.</p><p>KANDEL: Nasdaq will go up definitely, but I think the Dow will lead the way in the immediate future.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Well, I think that on your side, Myron, is the fact that you have a contrarian view, the majority of strategists on the Street are saying just the opposite of what you are saying.  So, probably a check in your column.</p><p>KANDEL: I like to be in that camp.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Myron, thank you very much.  Todd, I appreciate it.</p><p>EBERHARD: Thank you. CHERNOFF: Willow.</p><p>BAY: Up next, what is the future of the XFL?  We'll go behind the ratings drop.</p><p>Plus, \"ahead of the curve\" -- some of what you need to know tonight, ahead of tomorrow's trading.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: The league that was supposed to shake up a football-crazed country may soon be smacked down.  The head of NBC Sports reportedly warned the much heralded XFL will have to bring in more viewers to get another shot beyond this season.  Susan Lisovicz has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If you hype it, they will come.  And viewers did, for the first XFL game, which organizers said would revolutionize football.</p><p>But despite microphones in players' helmets, and cameras in cheerleaders' locker rooms, ratings for the World Wrestling Federation's offshoot into football have plunged 80 percent since, prompting NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol to tell the \"Washington Post\" \"evidence through the regular season was not promising for renewal.\" NBC put up half of the $100 million in launch costs and originally said it was committed to two years.</p><p>STEPHEN BATTAGLIO, INSIDE.COM: It doesn't deliver on either level, in terms of sports or entertainment.  The WWF and Vince McMahon promised they would do an old-fashioned, smash mouth type of football. You also thought that there would be stories developed; the way that they do on wrestling programs.  The big difference is that you don't know the outcome is the way you do on wrestling shows.</p><p>LISOVICZ: The most recent weekend measured by Nielsen shows seven NCAA basketball games, some of them daytime programs, finishing ahead of NBC's prime time XFL broadcast, which ranked 10th.</p><p>NEAL PILSON, PILSON COMMUNICATIONS: I think they are going to think about Saturday afternoons to the extent they can fit in games. I think they may have to think about PAX, which they control as another over the air network, they may have to move some of the games to their cable affiliates.</p><p>LISOVICZ: The WWF calls the XFL a work in progress.</p><p>LINDA MCMAHON, CEO, WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION: As we look forward to the end of this season, we think some of the changes to the play that we've instituted are being met with good feedback from our fans.</p><p>LISOVICZ: The most telling feedback right now: the continuous erosion in XFL's ratings.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz, CNN financial news, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: Willow, there's no doubt that there's a season for every sport and right now it's basketball season.</p><p>(LAUGHTER</p><p>BAY: Amen, Allan!</p><p>That's MONEYLINE for this Monday.

Here now, Lou Dobbs.</p><p>DOBBS: Good evening.</p><p>A chaotic session on Wall Street -- a technical breakdown shuts the world's largest equities exchange for more than an hour. The New York Stock Exchange confusion rattled many investors already contending with quarterly warnings from big tech companies, including Juniper, 3Com, and Handspring.  And prices ended the session sharply lower.  We'll have much more on the market retreat and the big board breakdown.</p><p>But first, President Bush prepares for his first trip across the Atlantic as commander in chief. President Bush saying that he will use his European trip to press for a fundamental rethinking of western defense strategy in the Post-Cold War world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUSH: Our United States and our allies ought to develop the capacity to address the true threats of the 21st century.  The true threats are biological and informational warfare.  The true threats are the fact that some rogue nations who can't stand America, our allies or our freedoms or our successes, will try to point a missile at us, and we must have the capacity to shoot that missile down.</p><p>DOBBS: And ahead of the president's trip, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld met with NATO officials in Brussels, looking to sell that missile defense plan.  Rumsfeld used satellite photos, videotape and other intelligence materials to argue that emerging threats from Libya, North Korea and other nations require abandoning the 29-year- old Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.  It will be a tough sell, with some NATO officials concerned that the missile shield would set off a new arms race.</p><p>And Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov, who also met with Rumsfeld today, said the alleged threat to the United States from long-range missiles is \"entirely hypothetical.\" Tim O'Brien has more from Washington now on the challenges facing the president on his inaugural European trip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM O'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The trip is much more than merely an opportunity for President Bush to take the measure of his European counterparts.  He'll be expected to have answers to difficult questions on a wide range of issues, like his proposed missile shield.  Europeans are not persuaded it is needed, or that it would work, or that the time is right to walk away from the ABM Treaty the U.S. signed in 1972.</p><p>JONATHAN CLARKE, CATO INSTITUTE: So they'll be saying to the president, can have a few years before going to that next stage.</p><p>O'BRIEN (on camera): And what if the president says no?</p><p>CLARKE: Well, then there will be some blood on the floor.</p><p>O'BRIEN (voice-over): The president will have his first meeting with Russian President Putin, who has publicly taken issue with missile shield idea.  With nearly $2 1/2 trillion going back and forth across the Atlantic each year, trade is also a huge issue, and the European Union also has differences with the United States.</p><p>FRANK VARGO, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS: The United States wants to sell something, you say, \"new, improved.\" In Europe that's not the way you sell things, so they're much more suspicious about genetically modified grains and things like this.</p><p>O'BRIEN: In the aftermath of Mad Cow Disease, Europeans are particularly suspicious of growth hormones in American beef.  The president's efforts aimed at imposing new barriers on steel imports, although helpful to the ailing U.S. steel industry, are also certain to be challenged.  Europeans are also angry over President Bush's rejection of the 1997 Kyoto protocol on global warming. The U.S., with only 5 percent of the world's population, is by some estimates, responsible for more than 25 percent of the pollution that leads to global warming.</p><p>IVO DAADLER, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: The president has now said that this is a problem.  The Europeans are going to ask, OK, what are you going to do about it?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>O'BRIEN: Mr.  Bush is all but certain to face stiff opposition to much of what he has come to represent.  As the new American president tries to reassure and to persuade, the other 18 heads of state will also be taking the measure of the man -- Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: Tim, in terms of the national missile defense system, there is really very little that Putin or any of the other heads of state can do about it, should the United States want to move ahead. Is that not correct?</p><p>O'BRIEN: That is correct, and that's why there's a great deal of concern that the president negotiate with these foreign leaders. Right now the negotiations are there, the consultation is there, but there is still a great deal of concern that the president may still choose to act unilaterally.</p><p>DOBBS: And I think it might be good if pointed out on this as well, Tim, that the Senate also made it clear it would not ratify the Kyoto Treaty, even had Mr. Bush or for that matter, Mr. Clinton decided to support it.</p><p>O'BRIEN: There's a great deal of problems with the Kyoto Treaty and global warming.  In fact, 25 percent of the pollution that leads to global warming, as we've seen, has been attributed to the United States.  So there's a big issue there.  What will the United States do about it?  What is the president's answer?  Right now, it's wait and see.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, Tim, thank you very much.  Tim O'Brien reporting from the White House.</p><p>Well, another issue making headlines across the Atlantic tonight: the future of the British pound sterling, falling to 15-year lows against the dollar.  That, after the Labour Party pulled off another landslide victory in the British election.  The markets are betting that the Labour government will opt to join the Euro currency and peg the pound sterling to the Euro at a weaker exchange rate.  The pound closed today at $1.38 in New York trading.</p><p>Back in Washington, the White House today announced plans to name Tennessee banker Susan Bies to fill one of the vacancies on the Federal Reserve board of governors.  Bies is now an executive at First Tennessee National.  She's worked there since 1979.  She holds a doctorate in economics from Northwestern.  She's taught economics at Wayne State University and once served as economist at the St. Louis Fed.  She would be the only woman on the Fed board, as well as the only person with real-life banking experience.  There are currently two vacancies on the Fed, and longtime Governor Edward Kelley recently announced his plans to retire.</p><p>Coming up next on MONEYLINE, the New York Stock Exchange breaks down for the first time in years.  We'll ask the chairman and the chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange what went wrong and why.</p><p>Dick Grasso joins us. An American business gathered in a nation where they're not allowed to do business.  We'll have a live report from Havana, Cuba.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, for more now on today's breakdown at the New York Stock Exchange, the trouble began at the opening bell.  A botched software upgrade corrupted trading at about half the big board's more than 3,000 stocks, and it 10:10 a.m. Eastern, the New York Exchange decided to halt all trading.  It's the first shutdown in nearly three years.  Trading resumed at about 11:35, but some stocks didn't trade until late in the session.</p><p>Peter Viles has our report -- Pete.</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, an embarrassing day for the New York Stock Exchange.  All 3,500 of the stocks that trade here -- all shut down, halted for more than an hour.  And all because of a software problem, a computer problem that was self-inflicted.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES (voice-over): An eerie scene -- trading halted at the New York Stock Exchange.  The Exchange opened on schedule at 9:30 this morning, but hundreds of stocks did not.  At 10:10, the Exchange shut down all trading, Twenty minutes later, Chairman Richard Grasso explained the decision.</p><p>RICHARD GRASSO, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, NYSE: Half our floor was operating seamlessly and as smooth as any typical day.  The other half of our floor was not receiving our electronic traffic, and we felt it was important for us to interrupt the entire market.</p><p>VILES: The glitch came from the overnight installation of new software, which caused problems at eight of the exchange's trading posts, and put traders in the dark.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We, effectively, were out of business on New York issues that we wanted to participate in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was basically no information, so a lot of upset traders.  A lot of very upset traders.</p><p>VILES: After 85 minutes, trading resumed at 11:35, a rare second opening bell of the day.  But even then, there were glitches. About 10 percent of the exchange's stocks did not trade until midafternoon.</p><p>GRASSO: We will spend the balance of this weekend, and well into next week, diagnosing, as my partner just said, what the problem was, where we, in our fault recovery processes, did not meet our zero- tolerance measure for uptime, and we will make the changes necessary.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: Among the traders we talked to today, a fair amount of sympathy for the exchange. Traders pointing out, as you did, Lou, that this has not happened in three years; there hasn't been a shutdown in three years, and the last one lasted only an hour. Traders also pointed out that if you work with large computer systems, and most of us do, you're aware that even the best computer systems occasionally do have a glitch and do go off-line, however briefly -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And when you're handling the kind of volume as the Big Board is, it's really remarkable that it doesn't happen more often, I think.</p><p>Seven hundred and sixty million shares -- that obviously, Pete, affected volume today.</p><p>VILES: Sure, volume on average runs around 1 billion, 2, a day. In some issues, a very dramatic drop-off.  IBM traded about 6 million shares yesterday, traded less than 3 million shares today -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: All right, Pete, thanks very much.  Peter Viles from Wall Street.</p><p>Well, the Big Board promotes itself as an exchange keeping up with the digital world.  The commercials they put out have a futuristic look, and mention the $2 billion dollars invested in technology.  And they end with the tagline: \"The world puts its stock in us.\" Today the claims of reliability and high-tech prowess put to the test.</p><p>Joining us from the New York Stock Exchange, it's chairman and chief executive officer Richard Grasso.</p><p>Dick, I know this has to be a tough day for you.  This software that you put in, whose software was it?</p><p>GRASSO: Well, Lou, first thank you for inviting me.</p><p>The software really is self-engineered.  The change that we made overnight, and I think it's important, Lou, for your viewers to understand that over the last three years we've had 1,000 systems releases into our network.</p><p>Last night we released a new program into half our systemic capacity, it failed.  What also failed, unfortunately, is our ability to recover without having to interrupt the marketplace\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Were you\u2026</p><p>GRASSO: \u2026 the software though, Lou, I think it's fair to say, is basically the stock exchange's software.  It's not any one vendor that's responsible for this.</p><p>DOBBS: You had to shut down trading for roughly an hour and 20 minutes.  You made that decision, as I understand it, because the retail side -- small investors, individual investors, would have been at a disadvantage. Is that correct?</p><p>GRASSO: That's correct, Lou.  The network delivers, about 90 percent of our orders to the trading floor, and a very, very high percentage of those orders are small investor orders.  It's important to remember that half our floor was operating, business as usual and, in fact, the other half, which was suffering under that faulty software release that we put in overnight could, indeed, have continued to trade with alternative delivery, but\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Dick, let me ask you -- I know your people are working over the weekend\u2026</p><p>GRASSO: They are.</p><p>DOBBS: \u2026 and into next week.  You're highly confident that this problem is going to be solved by the opening of trading Monday?</p><p>GRASSO: Lou, the public customer comes first.  We must protect their interests.  The small order was not being delivered.  We reverted back to the old system.</p><p>By the opening of trading on Monday, we will basically be back to the same reliable system that didn't have a minute's worth of down- time in the last three years.</p><p>DOBBS: Dick, thanks for joining us, Dick Grasso at the end of what has been a very tough day, particularly for the chairman of the Big Board.  Thanks.</p><p>GRASSO: Thanks for having me Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: The Big Board breakdown buffeted investors on a day when they didn't need much turbulence.  Several technology companies over the past 24 hours have reported warnings on sales, profits, or both, and that helped send the Nasdaq down today more than 2 percent.  The Dow broadly lower; all but five of the Dow 30 ending lower.</p><p>Jan Hopkins has our report from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAN HOPKINS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One trader said the computer glitch that paralyzed the New York Stock Exchange, quote, \"took us all out of our game today,\" end quote.</p><p>Frustration pushed many other trading rooms to the sidelines, resulting in the lightest volume on the New York Stock Exchange so far this year.</p><p>MICHAEL MURPHY, FIRST UNION SECURITIES: We were here trading listed stocks, if need be.  No one came and asked us to do so.  And there are other places where, if people needed to get things done, they probably could, and I didn't see people trying to access those markets, so I think it was a quiet day, and there was no panicking out there, and just another reason for someone to go home early, I think.</p><p>HOPKINS: The Dow Industrials tumbled 113 points to close at 10,997, just 13 points below where the index began the week. Honeywell, JP Morgan Chase, Hewlett-Packard, United Technologies and Boeing led the decline.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite slipped 48 points to 2,215 on the fourth- lightest volume of the year.  But the Nasdaq ended the week with a 3 percent gain.  Friday's warning from networking equipmentmaker Juniper Networks sent shivers through the tech sector, highlighting a tug-of- war that's been raging all week.</p><p>BILL BURKE, ROBERTSON STEPHENS: You have the bullish camp of people who think the worst is behind us -- doesn't mean that things are going to turn around over the next three to six months, but the worst might be behind.  And then obviously you have deteriorating fundamentals, still, with certain stocks, and that's the bearish camp.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOPKINS: Investors looking for a more stable market may have to wait until we're finished with the earnings preannouncement period. Until then, analysts say, expect more choppiness ahead -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Jan, this had to be quite a day down at the Big Board. How did people feel as they were walking out to begin their weekends after all of the down market and a closed market?</p><p>HOPKINS: Well, it was kind of a mixed picture.  Some were sympathetic to the exchange's problems, and others were angry that business was really interrupted during the day -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: All right, Jan, thank you very much -- Jan Hopkins.</p><p>Will, just ahead, a cable TV kingpin parts ways with a software powerhouse: the story behind what scrambled the deal between AT&amp;T and Microsoft.  And a new challenge to making money providing service to the Internet: entrepreneurs who promise wireless Web access, and the price is zero.  Also, cold weather in the Midwest has put farmers in a bind: the financial impact of unusually cold weather in the Midwest next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Just as the cable TV industry prepares for a major trade show in Chicago next week, a potential rift exposed between two big players.  AT&amp;T has decided not to deploy the next generation of software that Microsoft is scrambling to develop.</p><p>Bruce Francis has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Microsoft's biggest cable customer is zapping the software giant's cable TV software.  AT&amp;T says it will now use an earlier version of interactive TV services based on existing cable boxes.  That will indefinitely delay the deployment of software by Microsoft, which invested $5 billion in AT&amp;T just over two years ago.</p><p>Microsoft's cable TV software has been plagued by delays, and a list of features.</p><p>RICHARD DOHERTY, THE ENVISIONEERING GROUP: It is a big blow to Microsoft's schedule, because they had been showing some wonderful features of Microsoft TV, that third parties are going to take advantage of, of TV commerce, of news links, of Web links, and all this developer efforts right now have go to a plan B, or a plan C.</p><p>FRANCIS: AT&amp;T says consumer trials led them to choose the scaled-down system, but some experts believe tight capital played a role as well.  In addition to standard cable TV, AT&amp;T's upgraded system looks like this.  Customers will be able to get a limited version of video on demand and e-mail and Web access via a phone connection.</p><p>But lightning fast connections to Web, via a cable modem and the next generation services that go with it will have to wait.  That is a potential boon for Liberate, whose software is being used by AT&amp;T in its successful trial.</p><p>TODD RAKER, CS FIRST BOSTON: I think that this is just kind of a public confirmation that the Microsoft solution has not worked, so I view this as a positive development for Liberate.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: And it is not just cable infrastructure that is giving Microsoft a hard time.  Lately, cable programming has been a challenge, too. CEO Steve Ballmer recently said that if he had to do it all over again, he would not have invested in cable channel MSNBC -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: That would have made a lot of lives simpler, wouldn't it?</p><p>FRANCIS: Certainly would have, sir.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks, Bruce Francis.</p><p>Well, checking out how shares of each company traded today: shares of AT&amp;T rose fractionally, while Microsoft lost about half- dollar.</p><p>Coming up next here: we go live to Havana, Cuba, for a remarkable business meeting, the latest from CNN's Lucia Newman in Havana -- Lucia.</p><p>LUCIA NEWMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Lou.  Indeed, as you know, Cuba is still the forbidden fruit of the Caribbean for Americans.  But today, several dozen American businessmen from some of the largest and smallest companies in the United States met here with Cuban officials to prepare themselves for the day when that changes. We'll have more of that in just a moment -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Lucia, thanks.</p><p>Also ahead: Wall Street analysts under the gun.  Lawmakers taking a hard look at potential conflicts of interest.  And stocks prices hammered after a technical breakdown on the Big Board.  We'll check out what's ahead with Wall Street veterans Ned Riley and Hugh Johnson. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: And this just in to CNN, a federal appeals court panel late today has overruled a lower court judge who had ordered the Justice Department to allow the videotaping of Timothy McVeigh's execution Monday.  And if the appellate court's decision holds, there will be no videotaping of that execution.</p><p>Turning to business news.  American capitalists and Cuban communists getting together today in an effort to bridge the gulf dividing the United States and Cuba.  About 40 U.S. businessmen meeting with Cuban officials.  They're exploring opportunities for trade and investment.</p><p>CNN's Lucia Newman has the story now from Havana of the fifth U.S.-Cuba business summit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN (voice-over): They came for a business summit in the country with which Americans are not allowed to do business.  A waste of time?  Not so, say organizers of an event aimed at helping American companies prepare for the day they can do business here, a day many believe is now just around the corner.</p><p>KIRBY JONES, SUMMIT ORGANIZER: Things have changed a lot in the United States.  The bill passed last year so that the sale of food and medicines is now the law of the land, we are waiting for regulations. The Democrats have taken over the Senate.</p><p>NEWMAN: American businesses are visiting Cuba in droves, and lobbying hard for a partial or total lifting of U.S. trade sanctions against Cuba.  That would give them access to the Cuban market.</p><p>Sam Giancio, better known as one of the two fishermen who rescued Elian Gonzales at sea is in fact a roofer by trade.</p><p>SAM GIANCIO, ROOFER: I came here to educate myself, so when it does open up, you know, U.S.-Cuba relations open up, I'm hoping to be one of the first ones to be in the door here.</p><p>NEWMAN: Anyone hoping to sign a deal soon though will be disappointed.  Cuba demands the entire U.S. economic embargo, not just small bits of it, be lifted, before it agrees to buy even a grain of rice.</p><p>RICARDO ALARCON, PRESIDENT, CUBAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY: Any other country in the world will never accept to be treated as a second-class country.  Under those terms, there will not be any trade between our two countries.</p><p>NEWMAN: American businesses, however, don't seem to be deterred.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN: In fact, they say it doesn't matter what Cuba is saying today, even if the embargo isn't lifted totally, they believe that if trade restrictions are at least eased substantially, Cuba will agree to play ball -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Lucia, to listen to Alarcon talk about there wouldn't be any trade at all, yet Cuba is organizing and sponsoring and supporting these conferences.  When we get away from all of the political rhetoric, Cubans very much want to do business with the United States, do they not?</p><p>NEWMAN: Yes, the Cuban people certainly do, and I think the Cuban government is interested as well, but only under certain conditions.  They say that they want to be able to sell as well as buy, otherwise where are they going to get the money to purchase U.S. goods?  They say they also like other people in other countries should be allowed to have credit made available to them, which is right now restricted under the embargo.  So, they say they want to trade, but they want to trade on equal terms, just like everybody else, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: OK.  Lucia, as always, thank you.  Lucia Newman, from Havana, Cuba tonight.</p><p>Coming up next: stocks take a pounding, hit by tech warnings and a shutdown of the exchange itself.</p><p>Also tonight, as California gears up for a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts, we'll hear from the man who buys power for the state of California.</p><p>And the new frontier in cyberspace, online from a wireless device without paying a dime.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: In tonight's headlines, tech troubles on Wall Street: a software breakdown at the New York Stock Exchange.  Trading there halted for nearly an hour and a half this morning.  And stocks close out the day lower.  The Dow losing more than 1 percent on the day, the Nasdaq down more than 2 percent.  And President Bush preparing for his first overseas trip as Commander in Chief.  Topping his agenda: Gaining support for the national missile defense plan.</p><p>We begin tonight with one of the most controversial issues on Wall Street: conflict of interest.  An analyst recommendation can have of course a big impact on a stock price.  And even though the markets have buckled over the past year or so, it is rare to see an analyst recommend that investors sell a particular stock.  Now some lawmakers and regulators are going to find out why.</p><p>Their question: Whether analysts are trying to preserve business for their firms and misleading the public in the process.  Fred Katayama has the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wall Street's analysts are coming under more scrutiny than the companies they cover. The New York attorney generals office says it has begun an inquiry.  A spokesman for Elliot Spitzer said, \"We are always concerned that any conflicts that analysts may have are fully and fairly disclosed to investors and the public.\" Next Thursday, Congress will start hearings on that issue as well.</p><p>REP. RICHARD BAKER (R), LOUISIANA: This is a very big problem, it is a problem that can't be readily resolved with one political speech or one set of regulations, but it will be an examination process.  And I think it will be beneficial for the markets.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Analysts hardly saw stock they didn't like during the big bull market.  Last year sell ratings made up less than one percent of all recommendations.  Critics say analysts do not want to upset the companies they cover or their underwriting clients on the investment banking side of the business.  The head of this Web site that tracks analysts recommendations says those conflicts produced biased ratings.</p><p>KEITH FERRY, PRES., VALIDEA.COM: The general feeling is that is there a conflict of interest, and that analysts that are issuing buy recommendations or are covering a stock where they do have an investment banking relationship certainly do have an extra incentive to either promote the stock, or encourage investors to buy that stock.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Ferry feels that way because his firm's study found that one year after ratings were issued, stocks with buy recommendations from analysts who's firms do not have an underwriting relationship, returned on average more than 13 percent.  By contrast, buys issued by underwriters produced a negative return of 5.3 percent.</p><p>(on camera): Research directors at Wall Street firms would not comment.  The Securities Industry Association would only say that it is working on developing a code of best practices for analysts.  And an executive of the association will testify before the Congressional hearings next week.</p><p>Fred Katayama CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: As I mentioned last night, the Nasdaq must more than double in order to reclaim its high of just over a year ago.  Joining me now, two gentlemen who will explain how and exactly when this will happen.  From Boston, Ned Riley of State Street Global Advisers, and from Albany, New York, HUGH JOHNSON, of First Albany Securities. Gentlemen, good to have you with us.</p><p>NED RILEY, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISERS: My pleasure.</p><p>DOBBS: Let me begin, Ned, with you.  What was the impact of this glitch?  A big deal today for you?</p><p>RILEY: Well, Lou, we were actually lucky today because it was a quiet day in the marketplace.  If this was a day in which the Federal Reserve was meeting, or clearly, if it was bad down day when it started, I think it would have been much more an event than it was.</p><p>But I am a little concerned that they did continue trading and I don't think everybody knew that these stocks were not trading for a period of time.  And that does bother me somewhat.  I'm glad that they shut down trading totally until they clarified the situation, but I was concerned about the communication that took place, and not all of us knew that this was happening.</p><p>DOBBS: How about you, Hugh?</p><p>HUGH JOHNSON, FIRST ALBANY SECURITIES: Financial market history tells us, Lou, that you don't want to have long interruptions.  This brief interruption today that we had was a little bit unnerving to myself and to a lot of investors, but in the long run scheme of things I don't think it's really going to be a big deal.  So I think we will be through it on Monday and we will be on to what really counts in these markets.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, what really counts right now is for many investors getting that Nasdaq more than double and reclaiming all of that lost ground.  Hugh, give us your outlook for the market.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I'm pretty positive on things.  I think that the bear market ended, Lou, on March 22, and I think we are in a bull market. Investors are taking more risk, taking more risk for good reason.  The Fed has eased, money conditions are better, leading indicators for the economy are kind of telling me that the profits recession which has been big the problem all along, is going to end, say, end of the third quarter maybe fourth quarter.  So I'm pretty optimistic about things.</p><p>DOBBS: And, Ned?</p><p>RILEY: Well, I guess I wouldn't point put the profits turn that quick, Lou, but what I would say is that is five out of my six indicators for the market have turned positive, and they clearly are positive right now.  One, we have a Federal Reserve that is going to continue to ease.  And I must emphasize that point.  I don't think they're going to stop after the June 27 meeting.  They've got enough economic evidence to show that this economy is not recovering quickly enough.</p><p>Two, I think inflation will recede.  The inflation bugs out there, I think, don't have to worry right at the moment.  Three, I think liquidity is going to be solid. I think the Federal Reserve is creating a lot of liquidity.  I think valuation is in the marketplace right now, and it's going to stay there.  The supply/demand relationships are pretty good.  Profits are the only thing that is really, I think is going to create a problem through the end of this year.</p><p>DOBBS: Only profits.</p><p>RILEY: Well, that is a big point.</p><p>DOBBS: Let me ask you, Hugh, quickly give us two stocks that you like here and something we can -- will mark them down and track your progress.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, what I think you have to do is recognize what goes well or does well in a bull market.  Bull market stocks are consumer cyclicals, industrials and I hope in some time, technology. So, stocks like, you know, Home Depot, Mcgraw Hill Publishing, Tyco, General Electric, United Technologies and in the technology area, a company like Texas Instruments.  There's a whole slug of them.  I think they're all going to do well in this bull market.</p><p>DOBBS: Ned.</p><p>RILEY: Lou, I like the tech area and I still think that the leaders of the pack, the Ciscos, Microsoft, Dell, are all going to survive this period and actually be stronger when they come out other end.  I love the liquidity they have in the balance sheets right now. They have virtually no debt and they have a tremendous amount of cash, and shareholders equity is big.</p><p>So I do like the tech area.  I also like financials, Lou.  I like Citigroup.  I think it has been unduly depressed because of the concerns about the banking business, but I like financials as well, and I'd throw in also some of the health care stocks. A lot of change taking place.  I like Merck, and I like Pfizer.</p><p>DOBBS: All right.  You are an enthusiastic bull then, I think we can put you down as.  Ned Riley, Hugh Johnson, gentlemen, thanks for being with us.</p><p>RILEY: My pleasure.  Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up next here it's cool and it's wet.  A costly combination for Midwestern farmers.  We'll take a look at the now uncertain outlook for their crops after a springtime freeze and unusually cold weather this summer.</p><p>California refineries winning high powered support in their bid to avoid rolling blackouts this summer, good news for California motorists.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: In tonight's \"Powering America\" segment, the latest on the California energy crisis.  It has been a good week for Californians.  Just yesterday, we reported that electricity prices have dropped more than a third from their highs.  And today, Governor Gray Davis asked state regulators rather to exempt oil refiners from rolling blackouts this summer, that after a number of oil companies warned that they would have to cut production if they were faced with those power outages.</p><p>Joining me now from Sacramento, California is Ray Hart.  His title is deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources.  But what he is, is in charge of buying wholesale power for the entire state.</p><p>Very good to have you with us.</p><p>RAY HART, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: This is good news that prices have dropped.  The market is working?</p><p>HART: The market is working today, and there's -- four good reasons for that.  Governor Davis' program that he put forth few months ago for us to go out and buy long-term contracts is finally having an effect.  We've gotten nearly 50 percent of the on-peak energy needs met through our contracts that are fully executed now. We have a conservation program, the 20/20 program that Governor Gray Davis announced, that's starting to take effect, and we're seeing the conservation effects in the market now.</p><p>So what we have is 50 percent of our energy needs being met by our contracts.  We see almost 20 percent or 11 percent of total usage being reduced as a result of conservation, people taking it to heart. And with those two things, it leaves us on the spot market for around 25 percent of our needs on a daily basis.  That's compared to just 100 percent just a few weeks -- few months ago.</p><p>DOBBS: So, that is great news for Californians.  Does it mean that Californians tonight can be reassured that there will be at least fewer, if not a total elimination of those rolling blackouts this summer?</p><p>HART: Well, unfortunately it doesn't quite mean that.  As we get into the hotter days of summer, there will be times when we have those four or five days in a row of a 100-plus degree weather where the energy supplies will be very tight and prices will spike up.</p><p>The good news is that we've covered such a good portion of the net short that we don't have to buy as much energy on the spot market. But prices could increase tremendously high if we don't have any price caps.</p><p>DOBBS: And price caps, the president says there won't be any. So the market, which you say is working, is your best hope.  What is your outlook for the market?</p><p>HART: Well, I think there will be periods of time when the weather is average or below average as it has been this week for the most part where the market will be very liquid and we'll be able to take advantage of the market forces in play.  Unfortunately, when it gets hotter, the market forces drive it the other way and prices don't seem to have any ceiling in that respect.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Ray Hart, we're going to, like everybody else, hope you have cooler and a beneficial weather there in California.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>HART: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Ray Hart.</p><p>Well, it isn't power problems plaguing the Midwest: rather, weather problems.  Northern Illinois today enjoyed a full day of sunshine, but it was the first day of sunshine since May 19th.  The weather hasn't been this rainy and this cold during this time of year since 1928.  As a result, farmers in the Midwest are dealing with suffering crops, a reality that is also affecting the futures pits at the Chicago Board of Trade.</p><p>Lisa Leiter reports from Romeoville, Illinois.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISA LEITER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Illinois' warmest April in more than a century pushed Floyd Schultz to plant his corn crop early.  It was off to a good start until a few weeks ago when the sun stopped shining.</p><p>FLOYD SCHULTZ, FARMER: A farmer would call this field \"having yellowing in it.\"</p><p>LEITER: The yellowing is the unhealthy result of plants not getting enough sunlight and heat to absorb nutrients they need.</p><p>(on camera): The weather in the area has been so unseasonably cool and damp for so long that many crops have stopped growing.  This corn should be about knee-high by now.</p><p>(voice-over): Some newly sprouted soybeans are downright drowning.</p><p>SCHULTZ: The areas, some of them that are underwater, probably will die.  On our farm farther south, 80 miles south of here, we're going to have to look as things start to dry out and make a determination.  I think we probably will see some replant in that area down there.</p><p>LEITER: Concerns from the corn belt have been flooding the agweb.com Web site.  One Illinois farmer said, \"It's hard to be positive when the crop is fading before your eyes.\" And as this Iowa farmer put it, \"It's 'code blue' for my crop.\"</p><p>Those fears have now worked their way into the corn futures pit at the Chicago Board of Trade.  Corn prices shot higher in recent days after trading lower for much of this year.</p><p>STEVE BRUCE, MAN INTERNATIONAL: Minnesota, Wisconsin, even northern Illinois and Michigan -- and you know, that constitutes maybe 33 to 40 percent of the total corn production -- so if we lose 10 percent of the acres in those areas, if we lose 10 percent of the yield, we've got a story.</p><p>LEITER: So far, the story of this year's corn crop is still a pretty good one.  A report next week is expected to show the bad weather has hurt, but farmers' greatest fear is the weather will only get worse.</p><p>Lisa Leiter, CNN Financial News, Romeoville, Illinois.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up next, radio's answer to satellite television. We'll take a look at an upbeat assessment for satellite radio.  And later, a new threat to Internet Service Providers, wireless Web access, and it's free of charge.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: In tonight's \"Sectors Report,\" satellite radio: 100 channels of digital radio, everything from rock'n'roll to news talk, delivered by satellite, and the cost $10 a month.  Today, Lehman Brothers began coverage of the only two players in the sector, Sirius and XM Satellite Radio.  Lehman rating both a strong buy, putting a year-end price target of $40 a share on XM, $57 by the middle of next year for Sirius.  Although both stocks rose today, they've fallen far from their highs: both stocks down more than 50 percent from their highs in fact.</p><p>They're satellites are up-and-running. Radios, however, to receive the signals aren't expected to be out there in the marketplace until the middle of next year.  Still, Lehman is bullish on the business model, saying the concept will turn into a reality, helping a skeptical market become believers.</p><p>Coming up next here, renegades threatening (UNINTELLIGIBLE) Internet service providers offering free -- free! -- wireless Web access.  That story, a lot more still ahead on MONEYLINE.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Some of today's biggest market movers, United Surgical Partners gaining about 30 percent in its market debut -- not bad -- raising $126 million.  United Surgical managers out-patient care centers.</p><p>Callaway Golf down almost 20 percent: that after both a revenue and profit warning.  Callaway blaming a golf club price war and dramatic slowdown in the sales of its ERC II, which was recently banned by the United States Golf Association.</p><p>The second-most active issue on the Nasdaq, Juniper Networks. It lost almost $9 a share.  Juniper cutting quarterly sales forecasts by a third and slashing profit targets by 70 percent.  Layoffs, of course, on the way.  About 10 percent of Juniper employees will lose their jobs.  Juniper shares off 70 percent so far this year.</p><p>In other corporate news tonight, the $14 billion merger between Pepsico and Quaker will not close until at least the next quarter. Both companies today said they need more time to iron out the details with the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>IBM is breaking the law, Moore's law, that is.  IBM saying it can now boost microprocessor speeds by as much as 35 percent.  IBM claims the new technology rewrites that long axiom in the industry known as Moore's Law, which predicts chip speeds will double every 18 months. IBM today going beyond that, stretching the silicon on the chip, allowing electrons to flow faster, and not by adding more transistors.</p><p>And Procter &amp; Gamble today agreed to pay $49 million to settle a lawsuit by a shareholder, the shareholder lawsuit claiming P&amp;G misled investors about its financial heath just before an earnings warning last spring.  The stock plunged after that warning, erasing more than $30 billion in market cap -- excuse me.</p><p>There's a new threat to Internet service providers: A group of technophiles giving away wireless service for free.</p><p>Steve Young has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With a wireless modem, you can surf the Web free at this Manhattan coffee shop, thanks to Terry Schmidt, who strung his cable modem connection from his apartment upstairs through the wall, down the alley and into a transmitter back in the store.</p><p>TERRY SCHMIDT, NYCWIRELESS.NET: I've got more bandwidth than I'm using, and I'm willing to share it for free.  And there's a lot of corporations out there, you know, that have more bandwidth than they're using.</p><p>YOUNG: Setups like this are springing up all over the place, including San Francisco, Seattle and London, where it's taken on an aggressive anti-telecom tone.</p><p>Free wireless Web for the people using unlicensed radio spectrum and a new networking standard with the numbing name 802.11b, but known to its fans simply as Y-fi.</p><p>The Internet service companies have been slow in rolling out high-speed connections, and some customers are now taking matters into their own hands.</p><p>RUDY BACA, THE PRECURSOR GROUP: They can conduct guerrilla maneuvers.  This does present, potentially, a very serious threat to the larger commercial providers of these services.</p><p>YOUNG: Some liken it to the early days of Napster, but the New York Wireless Group hates the analogy.</p><p>ANTHONY TOWNSEND, NYCWIRELESS.NET: Napster's become somewhat of a pariah in the online community.  We're using equipment that we own, bandwidth that we've paid for, and we're sharing it with the community that we live in.</p><p>YOUNG (on camera): The pioneers of this technology say they hope to ruffle feathers and get the service companies to offer service in public places like train stations and parks.</p><p>Steve Young, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up next, final thoughts on the day, and \"Ahead of the Curve.\" Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Monday the president embarks on his first trip to Europe. Topping his agenda, attending the biannual U.S.-European Union Summit in Sweden.  News on the economy next week -- the producer and consumer price index reports will be out.  The Fed's beige book on the economic conditions around country, and the consumer sentiment report from the University of Michigan.  Also, quarterly results from Heinz and Adobe Systems, to name but a few.</p><p>Well, this week has been one of stark contrast, a week that began with some analysts saying the worst was over in technology, and by end of the week investors, well, numb by another round of tech earnings warnings.  And then, as if we needed a metaphor for the technology plunge on Wall Street, a technical breakdown at the New York Stock Exchange that shut down trading for almost an hour and half.</p><p>And California in crisis, not only facing power blackouts, but a shortage of water, and then the warnings that Californians -- refiners wouldn't be able to produce enough gasoline because Governor Davis wouldn't keep the refiners power going.  But by end of the week, the governor decided that he didn't want both rolling blackouts and no rolling cars.  He decided to give the refiners the power to keep those cars rolling. Power rates in California falling to a third of the levels they had been at.</p><p>Not, all in all, a bad week.  The market's working -- working not perfectly, certainly, but working.  Definitely not a bad week.</p><p>Now let's take a look at some of your comments.</p><p>Joanne from San Bernardino, California developing her own contingency plan in California to deal with those potential blackouts this summer.  She says: \"For the daytime, an eight-foot kiddie pool out back for when the power goes kaput, and at night, a flashlight with fresh batteries by the bed just in case.\" And if a real emergency crops up, she says she can take out her backup to her desktop PC, a Sears manual typewriter.</p><p>Andre wrote: \"If I recall properly, with your presence at MONEYLINE, our economy experienced the longest bull market run in U.S. history.\"</p><p>Well, Andre, I appreciate the sentiment, but I have to, in all fairness, remind you that I was also here during the stock market crash, the Asian financial crisis, the Russian financial crisis, and two recessions.  But thanks for the thought.</p><p>And finally, Kathleen says: \"Lou, it's great to have you back. Our dinner conversations are much more interesting with you delivering our news.\"</p><p>Well, we thank you for inviting us.</p><p>And finally tonight, time running out for one prospective multimillionaire.  The lucky winner of a $46 million New Jersey state lottery jackpot still has not come forward, and he has -- or she -- only until midnight tomorrow to do so.  The unclaimed prize money is the largest in that state's history.  But there is at least, no matter what happens, one clear winner: The agent who sold that ticket will receive $10,000 no matter what.</p><p>And for those of you who enjoy all sorts of strategies in picking out your lottery numbers, we should point out the winning ticket in this case is a quick-pick.</p><p>That's MONEYLINE for this Friday. We thank you for being with us. I'm Lou Dobbs. Good night from New York.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAN HOPKINS, GUEST HOST: Tonight, the most specific information yet about a possible terrorist threat inside the United States.  Al Qaeda suspects are being tracked in big cities all over the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Isolated and under siege, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat insists he can still do business with President Bush.  We'll hear why Arafat says he's a vital part of the peace process.</p><p>WorldCom moves closer to bankruptcy.  The biggest ever. Congress timely sees the company's books.  Tonight, the man leading that investigation, Congressman Billy Tauzin, is our guest.</p><p>The market (UNINTELLIGIBLE) is back, but the worry remained. Tonight, the fallout from the first big scandals rocking Wall Street in an era of mass stock ownership.</p><p>And the scorching heat in California is sparking fears of more rolling blackouts this summer.  What, if anything, is being done to prevent another energy crisis?</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is Lou Dobbs' MONEYLINE for Thursday, July 11. Sitting in for Lou Dobbs, Jan Hopkins.</p><p>HOPKINS: Good evening.</p><p>We begin tonight with a White House, once again, defending the president for his business dealings.  This time, President Bush is under fire for accepting more than $180,000 in loans, loans he received when he sat on the board of Harken Energy.  It's just this kind of deal that the president criticized two days ago.</p><p>Democrats tonight are accusing the president of hypocrisy.</p><p>John King has a report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Bush once benefited from a practice he now says should be illegal because of concerns about corporate corruption.</p><p>Back in 1986 and 1988, Mr. Bush received two low-interest loans from Harken Energy.  Mr. Bush was a company director at the time and used loans totaling more than $180,000 to buy 105,000 shares of Harken stock.  Such loans are legal and not uncommon, were reported to federal regulators, and repaid by Mr. Bush back in 1993.</p><p>But the president now says such insider loans should be illegal because he believes the scandals at Enron and WorldCom show the practice is being abused.</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: More than 10 years ago, this was a common practice, and, in this case, the president did everything he was supposed to do with your loans, reinvest it in the company so your company can grow, disclose it publicly, a far cry from what's happened today.</p><p>KING: Democrats see it as hypocrisy.</p><p>REP. DICK GEPHARDT (D), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: It is hard to lead when you haven't done the things that you're asking others to do.</p><p>KING; Democrats see political gain in a corporate corruption debate that reminds voters both the president and vice president are former CEOs and suggest the president's party is too cozy with big business.</p><p>PETER HART, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER: This is one issue that seems to galvanize Democrats and also forces Republicans to be able to take on the special interests which they have been helping for the last several years.</p><p>KING: Republicans say the president's popularity now is more important than anything in his business past.</p><p>BILL MCINTURFF, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER: People in the country aren't saying, \"Oh, my gosh.  The president filed a late SEC report, and the president used to own a company, and the president this.\" What they're saying is, \"What's he going to do to fix it?\" This is a country that is really tired of people in Washington fixing blame.</p><p>KING: Wall Street's reaction worries the White House much more than any criticism from the Democrats.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KING: And that late rally on Wall Street today offered some solace to the White House.  But the Dow Jones Industrial Average still off a little more than 6 percent since the president traveled to Wall Street earlier this week.</p><p>That speech was designed to calm investor jitters. The biggest worry here at the White House is that, if the markets don't rebound, investor anxiety becomes voter anxiety, and the president's party suffers come November -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: John, do you think the president surprised by all of the reporting on his past dealings with getting corporate loans after he took this on as an issue in that speech earlier this week?</p><p>KING: Well, the White House insists they are not surprised, and if the president is not surprised, then his top aides are not surprised by all these questions, Jan.</p><p>They have been but caught a little bit off guard, if you will, to the questions of will the president release the entire SEC file, ask the SEC to do that, as some Democrats have charged.</p><p>So they say, no, but their reaction sometimes to the questions suggests maybe a little bit.</p><p>HOPKINS: And in terms of the markets, is the White House starting to get concerned about its effect on the economy?</p><p>KING: Well, it certainly is, and the White House argument would be this, that you cannot expect one speech from the president to cause a market rebound.  They hope, over time, a psychology sets in that the president is serious about this, the Congress is serious about this, and that new reform steps will be taken.</p><p>The White House says, you know, the markets were having trouble before the speech, the markets are having trouble after September 11, there are other factors at stake here, but make no mistake about it they know that it's the president's own personal standing in the polls and the Republican Party's chances this November have a lot to do with how voters take a look at the economy and whether the president is doing anything about it.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much.</p><p>John King at the White House.</p><p>The corporate ethics debate took center stage in the Senate today. One senator after another sought to amend the so-called Sarbanes bill, while others called for an immediate vote.</p><p>Tim O'Brien has our story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM O'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Senators have already agreed the Securities and Exchange Commission will get more money and more power.</p><p>But still not enough under current proposals to satisfy Senator Carl Levin.  The Michigan Democrat proposed giving the commission the authority to impose large civil fines without first having to go to court.</p><p>SEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: They are not in a position then to do what other enforcement agencies can do in the face -- in the face -- of some of the worst deception that this country has ever seen, the deception which is now unfolding in too much of corporate America.</p><p>O'BRIEN: The unrest on Wall Street led some senators to call for an end to the debate.  For Phil Gramm of Texas, a vote couldn't come soon enough.</p><p>SEN. PHIL GRAMM (R), TEXAS: The sooner we put together a bill that will represent a compromise, the more certainty there will be on Wall Street and the quicker we will rebuild equity values in America and rebuild confidence in our market.</p><p>O'BRIEN: Gramm, who opposes key features of the Sarbanes bill, is expected to vote in favor of it and allow the measure to go to a conference committee to be reconciled with a much milder bill passed by the House last April.</p><p>Senator John McCain predicted Republicans are prepared to compromise.</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: The Oxley bill passed when the temperature was much lower than it is today, so I do have some confidence that we will see a better result from the conference.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>O'BRIEN: The expectation is that the Senate will give final approval to the Sarbanes bill early next week, and then the most intense debate, the debate in the conference committee, will begin -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Early next week? Possibly tomorrow?</p><p>O'BRIEN: We thought tomorrow.</p><p>HOPKINS: I mean, are they in that much of a rush?</p><p>O'BRIEN: We thought tomorrow, but the scheduling -- there's more debate than we thought.  It's going to be at the very earliest Monday, and some say it could be Wednesday. And the real debate, what really counts, will be in that conference committee, and no one can guess right now how that's going to turn out.</p><p>HOPKINS: I guess all the members of the Senate want to be on the record against what's going on, right?</p><p>O'BRIEN: They certainly do, and they certainly are, and there was some thought, because the House version is so different from the Senate version, that this debate would be long and acrimonious.</p><p>But there's pressure on everybody to get something done.  So there's going to be some measure coming out, and it will probably be swift.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks.</p><p>Tim O'Brien in Washington.</p><p>WorldCom appears to be on the verge of bankruptcy. The telecom company canceled its dividend payment to shareholders of its MCI tracking stock.</p><p>Separately, the U.S. Attorney in New York will take over the SEC lawsuit brought against WorldCom by its counterpart in Mississippi. The Mississippi attorney owned WorldCom shares.  The House Energy and Commerce Committee continues its investigation of WorldCom.</p><p>That committee gave the company a deadline of today to submit detailed financial reports.</p><p>Joining us now from Washington is the committee's chairman, Congressman Bill Tauzin of Louisiana.</p><p>So did the company meet the deadline?</p><p>REP. BILL TAUZIN (R), LOUISIANA: Yes, they did.  As of this afternoon, I think we received about five huge boxes of documents.  At least we believe that it contains the documents we have requested from WorldCom.</p><p>HOPKINS: Have you had a chance to look at the documents?  And what are they saying to you?</p><p>TAUZIN: Well, investigators are going through them as we speak, but I can give you some news.  I mean, we have learned something rather dramatic just this week.</p><p>What we have learned from some of the lawyers doing the internal investigation inside WorldCom is that Scott Sullivan -- you'll recall the fired CFO of the company, the guy in charge of financial affairs of the company -- admitted to those lawyers that the chairman of the company, Bernie Ebbers, did, in fact, know that millions of dollars -- hundreds of millions of dollars had been moved into those -- into capital debt rather than expensing it as ordinary debt of the corporation.</p><p>So this is the first evidence we have at least the CFO is saying to attorneys within the corporation that his boss, the CEO of the company, actually knew that the books were being cooked.</p><p>HOPKINS: Now, did Sullivan say that it was Ebbers that made him do it?</p><p>TAUZIN: We don't know that as a fact.  All we know now is that Sullivan is saying that his boss, the CEO, was at least aware that the books were being cooked.</p><p>HOPKINS: Now this appears to be fraud.  Where does this information go?</p><p>TAUZIN: Well, obviously, this information ends up with the Justice Department at some point.  It's part of an internal investigation, part of what we're learning through our committee investigation.</p><p>But, in the end, we make a report to the Justice Department of our findings, as well as, I'm sure, the internal investigators will make a similar report.</p><p>HOPKINS: What are you looking for?  I mean, is it fraud that you're looking for?</p><p>TAUZIN: Well, you know, our job is to try to find out what went wrong so that we can make sure that the reforms that are being recommended here in Congress are adequate, so we can make sure that the recommendations of the executive office and its recent executive order are sufficient and then to make sure those reforms are carried out.</p><p>So understanding what went wrong at WorldCom, just as we've tried to understand what went wrong at Enron, are important parts of the story and, therefore, lead us to the right solution, we hope.</p><p>HOPKINS: What have you found about Enron?</p><p>TAUZIN: Well, we found a number of things at Enron.  We found that the accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, which appears again -- over and over again at most of these companies that are failing, was the only one of the big five accounting firms that allowed its local partners, the ones that did the local auditing, to actually overrule the national headquarters in terms of its rulings.</p><p>The national quality review boards of all the accounting firms usually issue mandatory rulings upon their auditors in the field. Arthur Andersen was the only one that allowed its local auditors to do whatever they thought was right, in effect, gave them a free hand to work with an executive that might have wanted to cook the books.</p><p>And I think we're begging to see a pattern now at Enron, at WorldCom, at Global Crossing, at Qwest, and a whole bunch of corporations that have gotten into deep trouble.  We're beginning to see a combination of executives who felt like they could get away with aggressive accounting or cooking the books, hiding debt, inflating income, all for the purpose of driving up their stock shares, and then, secondly, accountants who were free, apparently, in Arthur Andersen to make decisions to allow them to do that when no other major accounting firm would allow that to happen.</p><p>HOPKINS: From what you've seen now, do you think that there are some people that are going to go to jail as a result of this?</p><p>TAUZIN: Oh, absolutely.  And, actually, I think the sooner some major corporate criminal goes to prison, I think the faster investor confidence is going to rebuild in this country.</p><p>What we've seen, basically, is that greed unchecked by fear has been at work in some of these big corporations and that the investors and the pension holders have been the big victims, the workers of the companies.  We've got to put some fear back in the equation.</p><p>People have to believe that they're being watched and that, when they do something wrong, just like any common criminal who steals, that they go to a real jail, not a country club jail, and that their ill-gotten gains have to be returned to the shareholders and the real owners of the corporation, the American people.</p><p>HOPKINS: One of the companies that you've been investigating is ImClone.  Martha Stewart has been implicated in this case.  Are you looking into Martha Stewart and her stock sales?</p><p>TAUZIN: Well, we have -- we've subpoenaed the records of her broker.  In our conversations with him and his attorney, we have requested his phone records because it's important for us to know the timing of when the phone calls were made from him to the various clients he had who sold stock the day before the ImClone stock crashed because of the decision by the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>The timing of the phone calls will tell us and will tell investigators a great deal about whether or not this was insider trading, whether or not it was ordinary trading, if you will, in advance of some bad news.  We\u2026</p><p>HOPKINS: And you can't tell yet?</p><p>TAUZIN: Well, there's a lot of suspicion.  I mean, the coincidences keep piling up, which makes you believe that somebody was telling somebody some bad news the day before it really happened, and so getting the phone records will tell us a great deal.</p><p>So the broker involved here, who has so far refused to turn over those phone records, has now been subpoenaed to do so.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much.</p><p>Billy Tauzin, representative of Louisiana.</p><p>Thanks for joining us.</p><p>TAUZIN: Thank you.</p><p>HOPKINS: A comeback for the markets today.  The Dow Industrials battled back from a triple-digit loss on good news from Eastman Kodak and Wal-Mart.  The Nasdaq overcame losses as well, closing with strong gains.</p><p>Kitty Pilgrim has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's not just the market anymore.  It's starting to get personal.  The glimpse of the ticker done sideways not wanting to really see the damage.</p><p>Today was one of those days, that low stomach-dropping fear, the Dow down 200 points at midday before the long climb back up to close just above 8,800.  The NASDAQ with an extremely volatile day, but some buying in stocks like Intel helped it gain more than 2 percent to close up 28 points at 1,374.</p><p>LEAH MODIGLIANI, MORGAN STANLEY: These are very difficult times, and it's painful.  But I actually think that prices are getting more reasonable, and, if you're a long-term investors, it's probably getting to be a good time to buy.</p><p>PILGRIM: The volatility was all the more frightening because of the context.  So far this week, the Dow down more than 6 percent, the NASDAQ down 5 percent, the S&amp;P 500 down 6 percent, and the Russell 2000 small caps down 5-1/2 percent.</p><p>And market performance has been so bad this year, some families admit the financial statements have been going into the kitchen drawer unopened.  They just don't want to see it.</p><p>Since hitting highs reached in early 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 25 percent of its value, and the NASDAQ has dropped a stunning 73 percent.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: I think that even though the markets had been very, very negative, they have been just oversold both on a numbers basis as well as a sentiment basis, and I think that, in general, we're at the beginning of the end for the down slide.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PILGRIM: Well, some took comfort in the fact that at the last hour of trading, all was not lost, and others said, because of the extremely heavy volume, it showed conviction and that the comeback was a keeper despite a harrowing day -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Good end to the day.</p><p>Thanks, Kitty.</p><p>Turning tonight to the MONEYLINE quick vote, what is your rating on stocks -- buy, sell, or hold?  Please cast your vote at cnn.com/moneyline.  We'll have results for you later in the broadcast.</p><p>After being dark for a couple of years, the national debt clock is running again.</p><p>The clock is located in New York Times Square.  It flickered to life this morning registering a debt -- national debt of $6.1 trillion.  It immediately began ticking higher at rate of $30 a minute.  The stock -- or the clock was shut down two years ago when the government was flush with budget surpluses.</p><p>Now the White House is projecting a $106-billion deficit.  The government's borrowing limit has been raised to $6-1/2 trillion. That clock was erected in 1989 by real-estate developer Seymour Durst.</p><p>Still to come on MONEYLINE, top Cabinet members go to Capitol Hill to talk about homeland security, as government sources say that dozens of al Qaeda suspects are being watched in some of America's biggest cities.</p><p>Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is defiant.  He tells CNN no one can set aside the choice of the Palestinian people.</p><p>And the blame game over California's energy market escalates as power companies battle the West's latest heat wave.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: Government sources today gave the most specific information yet about FBI operations to track al Qaeda operatives within the United States.  News came as Attorney General John Ashcroft and other Cabinet members went to Capitol Hill to talk about homeland security.</p><p>Kelli Arena has more -- Kelli.</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Jan, in some America's biggest cities, including Seattle, Chicago, Detroit, and Atlanta, sources tell CNN groups of suspected al Qaeda operatives are being closely watched by the FBI.  Now there are fewer than 100 under surveillance, but the threat is serious.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Today, the United States is at war with a terrorist network operating within our borders.  Al Qaeda maintains a hidden but active presence in the United States, waiting to strike again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARENA: And as the United States moves to protect its borders, the attorney general says that terrorist organizations are adapting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHCROFT: As we limit the access of foreign terrorists to our country, we recognize that the terrorist response will be to try and recruit U.S. citizens and permanent residents to carry out their attacks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARENA: The statements come as sources tell CNN investigators are pretty much convinced there is another attack being planned by al Qaeda, although there is no specific intelligence about a target or a date -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: And that's the same as we've been hearing all along?</p><p>ARENA: Yes, it is.</p><p>HOPKINS: Kelli Arena.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>My next guest says that house lawmakers have changed many of the elements in the original plan for the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Former Defense Secretary and MONEYLINE regular Bill Cohen joins us now.</p><p>Welcome back, Bill.</p><p>WILLIAM COHEN, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY: Good evening.</p><p>HOPKINS: My question, actually, first is would one department track al Qaeda operatives in the United States better than the way the system is now?</p><p>COHEN: Well, much depends upon the agency involved.  One of the things that's taking place now through these hearings is to really give an opportunity for members who represent the various agencies and who have developed expertise in their jurisdictional boxes, so to speak, an opportunity to see what would take place, would security actually be improved by transferring it in whole or in part to this new agency.</p><p>Now you have to remember that this Department of Homeland Security was basically created by four people in the executive department with very little consultation by other members of the Cabinet and certainly none -- no consultation with members of Congress, so this is a process whereby the need for either transferring in whole or part to the homeland security agency or department will be very important to flesh out.</p><p>My fear is that there will be a rush to failure, that they will be so compelled by a symbolic gesture to finish by a certain date that they will put something together that really is not functionally very efficient or successful, and we'll see the equivalent of financial earnings restatements coming forth in the coming months and years.</p><p>So I think we should take a little bit of time and be careful how this is all put together.</p><p>HOPKINS: Well, the White House wants basically one huge umbrella organization.  The House isn't so sure that that would work the best. What do you think?</p><p>COHEN: Well, again, it depends.  That's why it's important to have these hearings.  Ordinarily, you would say it would operate best under one department, but there may be the expertise that has been developed in a given agency that should not be transferred to the department, and so each committee will go through and make its recommendations.</p><p>Ultimately, the House will have its select committee under the aegis of Dick Armey who will come forward with a recommendation voted up or down by the House and then go over to the Senate for at least a similar type of process.  But I think it's too early.</p><p>My caution would be: Do not rush this process.  Make sure that we do it right rather than fast because we're bound to have a number of seams that are developed, and those seams can be exploited by the very terrorist groups you were talking about just a moment ago.</p><p>HOPKINS: The Treasury Secretary has put a price tag on all of this at about $3 billion over, say, 10 years.  Is this too expensive?</p><p>COHEN: Well, nothing is too expensive in terms of coming to protect the American homeland.  We can afford to do whatever is necessary.</p><p>The question becomes, in terms of this $37.4- or $37.5-billion department, whether it'll be more expensive than that and whether the so-called efficiencies achieved by consolidating all of these agencies under one umbrella will produce those savings.</p><p>There's a lot of skepticism on Capitol Hill whether there's enough money to do what the administration claims it is going to be able to do through the consolidation.</p><p>HOPKINS: Can we make the homeland secure?  Is it possible?</p><p>COHEN: We can make it more secure, certainly, than it has been to date.  We have seen a good deal of laxity, some indifference, some incompetence, and, frankly, that has to change.  I think that attitude is changing.</p><p>You're seeing this administration now bring forward a plan, which, hopefully, galvanize the American people and all of the agencies working on behalf of the American people to protect the people much better than they have in the past.</p><p>HOPKINS: And are you surprised at all about the news that al Qaeda operatives are being tracked in various cities across the U.S.?</p><p>COHEN: Actually, I'm not.  We have known for years now that there are terrorist groups inside the United States, and they tend to surface and our attention tends to peak whenever there is tension and potential conflict in the world.</p><p>We now know and have known for sometime there are terrorist groups here.  We watch them closely.  That is being done today, and I think that will intensify.  But it doesn't come as a surprise at all.</p><p>HOPKINS: William Cohen, former defense secretary and a MONEYLINE regular.</p><p>Thanks for being with us.</p><p>COHEN: Thank you, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Coming up next on MONEYLINE, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat says he is not concerned about President Bush's call for a new Palestinian leadership.  We'll have an exclusive report.</p><p>A massive typhoon sweeps across Japan flooding thousands of homes, cutting dozens of highways.  We'll have details.</p><p>And how a continuing plunge in the markets could stop consumer spending and bring the U.S. economy to a halt.</p><p>All of those stories coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat remains defiant in the face of President Bush's call for a change in the Palestinian leadership.  He told CNN in an exclusive interview that no one can bypass the Palestinian people and their choice of a leader.</p><p>Brent Sadler has the story from Ramallah in the West Bank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENT SADLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A top diplomatic house call on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</p><p>(on camera): How are you going to get in?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Walk in.</p><p>SADLER: Climb over here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it is another way.</p><p>SADLER (voice-over): A two-man European Union delegation headed by Middle East envoy Miguel Moratinos crossing a no man's land to a place under siege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think they're asking you to go back.</p><p>SADLER: We stick close to the VIPs entering the outer ring of Mr. Arafat's.  It's behind concrete-filled barrels and three floors of sandbagged windows that the EU's diplomatic business takes place with the leader Israel has cast aside and to whom the United States has turned bitterly cold.  But the Europeans seem on a different track, and Mr. Arafat is adamant he has a mandate to lead.</p><p>YASSER ARAFAT, PRESIDENT, PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY: First of all, no one can bypass the Palestinian people and their choice and their election.</p><p>SADLER: It is now seven months into the on-off siege of his Ramallah headquarters.  A dull routine has set in with signs of boredom.</p><p>Israel's surgical military strikes have obliterated most of the complex, leaving Yasser Arafat with just one room intact where he says he works day and night, sleeps on the floor with a mattress, and uses this rug to pray.</p><p>During an informal lunch, Mr. Arafat drinks soup and tells me he thinks Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is waging a personal battle against him using old siege tactics to collapse his power which are doomed to fail.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SADLER: Mr. Arafat told me that those siege tactics, as he described them, were doomed to failure.  He also said that he did not expect the Israeli reoccupation of seven of eight West Bank urban centers to end in the coming days.</p><p>He did, however, say that, despite the observe isolation, he was still able to make contact with the outside world.  For example, he said he was speaking to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan ahead of this weeks' quartet meeting in New York about the Middle East.</p><p>Back to you, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: So, Brent, he still is quite resolved to continue leadership and continue peace talks?</p><p>SADLER: Yes, indeed.  Despite the continuing encirclement of his compound, you can't see it, but it's where those lights are behind me just a few hundred yards, he continues to operate, he says, working the phones.  And also very important, he says, to really try and build on these contacts that began only this week between some of his new ministers and the reshuffled Cabinet and the Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.  He also says it's imperative for the leadership to work towards implementing a 100-day plan of reforms, which he wants completed by the time legislative council elections are slated for the third week of January -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Brent Saddler.</p><p>My next guest says that President Bush's Middle East policy has left the United States isolated, not the Palestinians.  Edward Abington joins us now.  He's a consultant to the Palestinian Authority and a former U.S. consul-general to Jerusalem.</p><p>What is your sense that President Bush is approaching this in the wrong way, trying to get rid of Mr. Arafat?  Who else is going to replace him?</p><p>EDWARD ABINGTON, CONSULTANT TO PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY: Well, I think the problem is that we've made Arafat the issue rather than reform.  The Palestinian people want reform, but by putting President Arafat out there as the issue, you undermine the reformers and the people that want to see political change among the Palestinians.</p><p>HOPKINS: And what you're saying is that the rest of the world, basically, disagrees with the U.S. and the Israeli position?</p><p>ABINGTON: Well, that's essentially the case.  The Europeans are dealing with Arafat, as we've just seen.  So are the modern Arab countries -- Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Nations, the Russians, other countries.  We essentially have painted ourselves in a corner, and we've made it much more difficult to achieve a very legitimate objective of reform of Palestinian institutions, and strengthening Palestinian governance by making Arafat the issue.</p><p>HOPKINS: Now today, we had word that the Israelis are putting on trial one of the Palestinian moderates, also a report yesterday that one of the peace activists within the Palestinian community had his office closed basically by the Israelis.  Is Israel trying to get rid of all of the opposition?</p><p>ABINGTON: You have to ask the question whether the Sharon government when it calls for reform of Palestinian political institutions is just using that as an excuse to avoid dealing with the fundamental issues.  I was just recently in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I returned there last week, and I found that the situation among Palestinians is the worst that I've seen in 30 years.</p><p>The -- one-third of the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza is subsisting on food handouts from the international community, and the number is growing every single day.  There is serious malnutrition among Palestinian children, as demonstrated by a recent AID survey, and I think that the situation is facing a humanitarian disaster.</p><p>The Israelis side, their economy is faltering.  Neither party can get out of the current situation without a catalyst from the outside, and it's the United States that needs to provide that role.</p><p>HOPKINS: So you think that the U.S.  should come back in, take a more active role, and change its position on Arafat?</p><p>ABINGTON: It's not so much changing the position on Arafat.  I mean, we can't determine who the Palestinian people select as their leader.  I would say encourage the process of political reform, which cannot take place and which cannot reach fulfillment so long as the Israelis are in reoccupation of the West Bank as they are today.</p><p>We have to set up a process where the Palestinians do things and the Israelis do things, and each moves towards deescalating the situation, but we've laid out a sequential process where getting rid of Arafat and Palestinian political reform has to take place under conditions that are nearly impossible.  It can't succeed the way things are now.</p><p>HOPKINS: Ed Abington, former U.S. consul-general to Jerusalem and now a consultant with the Palestinian Authority.  Thank you \u2026</p><p>ABINGTON: Thank you very much.</p><p>HOPKINS: \u2026  for joining us.</p><p>Up next on MONEYLINE, a dramatic day in the markets ends with a late-day rebound.  Greg Clarkin will have the full story.</p><p>We'll also tell you who today's investors are, whether they own stocks directly or indirectly, and if they're rookies or veterans.</p><p>And a huge storm causes chaos in the German capital and the surrounding region.</p><p>All that and more when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: A dramatic turnaround on Wall Street today.  The session began with intense selling.  The Dow plunged more than 200 points at its low.  As one trader put it early on, the bear train is running at full speed.</p><p>But in the end, the markets drastically cut their losses.  The Dow was down only 12 points at the close. The Nasdaq was up 28.  The S&amp;P was up nearly seven.</p><p>Greg Clarkin has been following today's volatile session in he's here now -- Greg.</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And, Jan, this was a really wild afternoon.  Traders telling us the key point was right about midday.  Now the Nasdaq had hit its session low of 13.23.  They said a snap-back rally more technical in nature was due, and that's exactly what we saw.</p><p>Now rumors were swirling today that some of the big tech companies will be out with positive news after the bell and Dell has done just that.  Now Dell saying that earnings will be a penny better than expected.  The stock is soaring in after hours trading after gaining during the day as well.</p><p>And Intel is up eight percent on rumors of positive news.  Sun rose seven percent for the same exact reason, and it was a tough market for a new offering, Kirkland's found that out the hard way. The Tennessee home furnishings retailer fell on its first day of trading.</p><p>Now among the NYSE winners, Eastman Kodak, it said it would top earnings estimates and thanks to the benefits of its restructuring and shares of Wal-Mart managed to gain its earnings should also be better than expected thanks to strong sales.</p><p>But the dual fears of accounting tricks and profit weakness never really far from the markets today.  Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb sank on word the SEC is looking into its sales to see if they were inflated.</p><p>SAP is Europe's biggest software company.  It got lucky today. The stock recovered with a tech rebound despite its warnings that sales would be well below expectations.</p><p>So again, this rally more technical in nature than anything else. The problems hammering away at the markets recently, really not going anywhere at all today, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Maybe it was all of the attention on the market that caused the buyers to come out.</p><p>CLARKIN: That's that old theory, once the media starts focusing like they were today, who knows?</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Greg Clarkin.  We'll see what happens tomorrow.</p><p>The recent sell-off in the markets have wiped out more than a half a trillion dollars in market capitalization this week alone. Some economists now worry that the weakness in the stock market could threaten the economic recovery.</p><p>Kathleen Hays has that story -- Kathleen.</p><p>KATHLEEN HAYS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Jan.  In fact, this week economists at Goldman Sachs saying they no longer expect the Fed to start hiking interest rates November.  Now they say the Fed won't start hiking rates until the second half of next year.  They say they're getting much more pessimistic on the economy because of the decline in stocks.</p><p>In fact, Bill Dudley said that it normally at this stage of the business cycle, stocks are up at least 20 percent, but this time around, they're down more than 18 percent.  He says the impact of falling stock prices is offsetting, in fact, last year's aggressive series of Fed rate cuts by actually tightening up financial conditions.</p><p>Steve Roach of Morgan Stanley, he's been bearish on the economy for sometime, but now more than ever now.  Investors continue to grow more wary of U.S. markets.  They'll demand higher rates or return. The whole U.S.  assets, he says, in fact that means higher interest rates if that happens.</p><p>He says this would not only crimp business capital spending, but could cut into home building activity and consumer spending on durable goods -- that's big ticket items like cars.  He says that alone could trigger the fear double dip.</p><p>Mark Vitner of Wachovia Securities says we're already seeing the impact of the stock markets drop on the consumer.  At the height of the bubble, we all were spending more than twice the rate of growth of our after-tax incomes.  Now spending is growing at a slower rate than income and of course, Jan, the worry is that if stocks don't find a bottom, the consumer could keep decelerating.  So I guess the real implication for our viewers is they better just ignore this bad stock market and keep spending money to keep everything afloat.</p><p>HOPKINS: Well, and things did turn around today.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Kathleen.</p><p>The scandal over corporate ethics has been described as the first involving a new and potent class of Americans, mass investors.  But half of all American households now own stock.</p><p>Peter Viles has this story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The crisis of confidence in the stock market and corporate America has rapidly become a major political issue and it is introducing Washington to a potentially powerful class of voters, American investors, 49 million household strong.</p><p>PETER HART, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER: It's no longer the upward income, up scale people.  These are average, hard working people who are now invested in the market, and it's their life savings and it's their future and they're scared.  They're nervous.  They're uncertain because they don't think the rules of the game are fair anymore.</p><p>VILES: The most recent widespread survey of investors is three years old.  It found that 78.7 million Americans owned stocks, either directly or through mutual funds. That's 48 percent of all households, a dramatic increase from just 19 percent in 1983.</p><p>JIM SPELLMAN, SECURITIES INDUSTRY ASSN: The average investor is middle age, in their mid 40s, baby boomer, earning about $65,000 a year. They gave about $70,000, $80,000 in the market and that represents about two-thirds of their total financial assets excluding their house.</p><p>VILES: For all the concerns over investors who have never lived through a bear market, the typical American investor is a seasoned investor.  Fifty-four percent of all equity holders bought their first stock or mutual fund before 1990.  Twenty-eight percent in the first half of the '90s.</p><p>Only 18 percent after 1995.  An important point, though, roughly half of the people we're talking about do not own stocks directly. Eighty-five percent of those exposed to the stock market own mutual funds.  Only 54 percent own stocks directly. Sixty-six percent of the total investing class own stocks or mutual funds through an employer- sponsored retirement plan such as a 401(k).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: And one more important point about where the power is in this investing class, these investors who really have the ability to force change.  As individuals, Americans own roughly 38 percent of the stock market, but big institutions, pension funds and mutual funds that own stock on behalf of individuals are more powerful.  They own roughly 42 percent of the market -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: And we've been hearing some about people's cashing in their mutual funds, redemptions.</p><p>VILES: Redemptions on mutual fund, interesting thing in the statistics.  Even though individuals and institutions are roughly the same size in what they own of the markets, individuals took a bigger hit in the big pull back that began in the middle of 2000.  They lost more of their money than the institutions did, and the institutions basically are better, broadened out, better diversified.  They didn't take the big hit that individuals did.  So even though the institutions are more powerful, it's the individuals who are really feeling the pain.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Peter Viles.</p><p>VILES: Sure.</p><p>HOPKINS: Now a reminder to vote in tonight's MONEYLINE poll.

Finger pointing over California's energy shortage escalates.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: El Nino is back, but this time forecasters say the weather phenomenon won't be as big or as bad.  Four years ago, an earlier El Nino killed 24,000 people worldwide.  Here in the United States, heavy rains and winter storms triggered mud slides in the West, snow in the desert and a wet winter in the East. Forecasters say the U.S.  will begin to feel some of the El Nino effects this fall, but again, they say it won't be as bad.</p><p>A tropical storm in Japan has now killed five people.  The deaths occurred as Chataan slammed into Japan's main island.  Thousands of homes were flooded.  Nearly 2,000 people evacuated. Seven bridges destroyed stranding thousands of travelers.  Chataan has moved north to the island of Hocito (ph).</p><p>A freak storm in Germany killed seven people, including two teenagers.  That storm lashed Berlin with winds of 90 miles an hour. More than 1200 trees were felled by the winds.  Two teenagers died when a tornado swept through their camp.  German officials say the storm is the worst in three decades.</p><p>And in this country, cooler weather is finally moving into California.  But after several days of record setting temperatures, and energy alerts, many Californians were left with a sense of deja vu.  A heat wave last year left many in that state without power and feeling powerless against soaring energy prices.</p><p>Casey Wian has the story from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): California lawmakers continue to point fingers at outsiders they accuse of manipulating the state's energy market, driving prices higher and forcing blackouts. The latest target, Perot Systems, which help designed the computer system for the state's electrical grid operator.  Lawmakers say they've uncovered documents showing Perot Systems helped energy companies profit from loopholes in the system it helped designed.</p><p>STEVE PEACE, CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE: The three key players were Enron, Dynegy and Reliant.  And then along comes this information with Perot System.  You all seem to have something in common, 10-gallon hats in Texas.  Can you tell me why it is that you Texans seem to be so effective at \u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSS PEROT, PEROT SYSTEMS: Wait a minute. All the -- all the activity, sir, all the activity was being carried out by people.  I think if you check their backgrounds, they came from this area.  The facts are \u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEACE: I just want to know why you all keep winning.</p><p>PEROT: It's a good joke, but it's not (UNINTELLIGIBLE).</p><p>WIAN: Perot says his company never disclosed inside information, rather it was trying to point out flaws in California's newly deregulated electricity market, warnings the company says were largely ignored.</p><p>Meanwhile, California's energy market has stabilize since the blackouts of 2000 and 2001.  Soaring temperatures have forced power grid officials to issue warnings and encourage conservation on two days this week, but there were no blackouts.</p><p>BILL KEESE, CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION: With what we have added and with what we anticipate coming in, we can handle a hotter than normal year.</p><p>WIAN: In the past year, power plants capable of supplying about two million homes have been completed in California.  Conservation has reduced demand and the state has bailed out utilities by signing billions of dollars in long-term power contracts.</p><p>(on camera): State officials say they can not guarantee that California will make it through the summer without blackouts, but they are optimistic because of their ability to manage this week's heat wave.</p><p>Casey Wian, CNN Financial News, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOPKINS: Coming up next, more help for victims of the September 11 attacks against America.

JIM BUNNING (R), KENTUCKY: The owners saying that almost all the teams are losing money and yet we have owners that will go out and pay $25 million to a player for a year salary and for one player to think that they can change their team by the addition of one player is not very smart.

Welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>Another punishing day on Wall Street.</p><p>BAY: Blue chip stocks down again; five losing days out of the last six sessions.  Twice today, the Dow was down more than 200 points, just a few points away from triggering a trading curb.  The spark behind the sell off: more strong economic numbers and tough talk on inflation from one Fed governor.  But by day's end, blue chip stocks had cut more than half their losses.  Now, the market is bracing itself for tomorrow's report on jobs.</p><p>Christine Romans has more in today's \"Street Sweep.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): High anxiety gave way to late bargain buying on Wall Street, but investors remain nervous ahead of tomorrow's employment report.  After plummeting early in the day, the Dow ended down 94 points to 10,843.  The Nasdaq fell 16 points to 2,734.  But bonds continued their swan dive, tumbling 20/32 of a point, with the yield up to 6.126 percent.</p><p>Rattling the markets early today, hawkish comments from Fed governor Edward Kelley, who warned that the Fed remains on the inflation alert.  Adding to the fear: a report showing a spike in labor costs.  At least one analyst says Wall Street should be wary of the Fed's next move.</p><p>GAIL DUDACK, WARBURG DILLON READ: What people, I think, don't accept quite yet is that when you have a Federal Reserve or Central Bank in tightening mode with very high valuation, that's always been dangerous.</p><p>ROMANS: The fear of rising interest rates rattled financial stocks on the Dow, with American Express and J.P. Morgan hit hard. Other Dow losers today: GM, IBM and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>The biggest Dow decliner was Sears, down 3 11/16 after the retail landmark slashed its profit forecasts.  And scandal slammed the stock of Republic New York.  Investors fear that an investigation into possible securities violations could threaten the bank's merger with HSBC.</p><p>Now investors are focused squarely on getting past tomorrow's jobs report; the big obstacle before the Labor Day getaway.</p><p>JAMES MCGUIRE, HENDERSON BROTHERS: I think Tuesday is going to be a whole new ballgame.  I think there are people looking for perhaps investors to come back into the market, now that the interest rate picture may be a little clearer on Tuesday.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: The suspense will be over at 8:30 Eastern time tomorrow morning.  The expectation?  That the August unemployment rate edges down to 4.2 percent and about 200,000 new jobs were created.  If the numbers are significantly stronger it could make for an interesting day on Wall Street -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: OK.  Christine, like everyone else, we'll be watching closely.  Christine Romans from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, economic numbers out today clearly rattled investors.  Those reports, along with a reality check from one Fed board member, added up to one disturbing message for investors: The Fed may not be done raising rates.</p><p>Bill Dorman looks at the inflationary pressures lurking in the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL DORMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The gospel according to Alan Greenspan says keep a close watch on labor costs and worker productivity for signs of inflation.  The pace of productivity growth is slowing while labor costs are rising faster than they have in more than five years.  Federal Reserve governor Ed Kelley today warned investors it's \"premature to assume the Fed will wait until next year to raise interest rates further.\" Toss in sizzling car sales and a number of companies anxious to issue bonds, and it's enough to push long-term interest rates higher, and to worry stock investors.</p><p>PAUL JOHNSON, FUTURES ANALYST, ING BARINGS: Car sales that are really as high as we've seen since 1986; the fact that we're getting a lot of supply of corporate debt, perhaps because of Y2K fears, during the month of September.  I think all of those things helped push the market a little bit lower today.</p><p>DORMAN: Inflation hawks also point to a weakening dollar, down more than 10 percent against the yen in less than two months.  And if you're looking for another worry, check out oil prices.  They've been climbing all summer.  But not everyone is worried about an immediate rate hike from the Fed.</p><p>GARY THAYER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, A.G. EDWARDS: Consumers are feeling good about the economy, but confidence is not growing as fast as it did last year, and there are other indicators out there that suggest to us that although the economy is still very healthy, it's not probably going to overheat.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DORMAN: One slowing indicator: construction spending has fallen for four months in a row, which often leads to a broader economic slowdown.  But the immediate focus for the Fed and for the markets is clearly jobs.  Friday's employment report is the first look at the economy in August and the most important report before we head into a long holiday weekend -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, indeed it is.  Bill Dorman reporting.  Thank you, Bill.</p><p>Well, the fear of another Fed rate hike has slammed stocks and bonds over the past week.  The 30-year Treasury Bond slumped again today for the sixth straight session.  The yield is up more than a quarter point in just a week.  Our first guest tonight told us here on MONEYLINE last week that there was a real chance the Fed would raise rates again.  Now it seems the markets agree.  Joining us now from Chicago, Jim Bianco of Bianco Research.</p><p>Jim, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>JIM BIANCO, BIANCO RESEARCH: Thanks for having me.</p><p>VARNEY: There doesn't seem to be much inflation in the underlying economy.  Is the Fed now perhaps looking more at inflation in the stock market?</p><p>BIANCO: I think so.  If you take Greenspan at his word, he is looking at asset prices, and if you really read into what he said, and even what Fed governor Kelley said today, they basically said that the stock market is playing a role in monetary policy; it's not a dominant role.  And then you have to ask yourself the question: Can the economy slow appreciably like the Fed would like, with stock prices continuing to make a new high? And it becomes very difficult to make that assertion that the stocks can continue to go to 12,000 and the economy will slow like they want.  So stock market is having a factor in there.</p><p>VARNEY: Do you think the -- Alan Greenspan therefore has become now the chief stock market regulator?</p><p>BIANCO: I don't know if he'd become -- would like that phrase. And I know that the stock market is a role where maybe it had no role a couple of years ago.  But yes, I think that if the stock market were to continue to appreciate at 25 percent a year like it has for the last couple of years, it would alter Fed policy, and in some respects, he is a bit of a stock market regulator.</p><p>VARNEY: Two factors we hear a lot about: the declining dollar and America's trade imbalance; they are both suggesting higher interest rates, correct?</p><p>BIANCO: Yes, they are, and I think that they are more toward the economy than they are toward the financial markets.  The declining dollar would look toward potentially increasing prices, and that would be inflationary.  But if you're looking for an immediate move out of interest rates because of the declining dollar, foreigners haven't been very active in our financial markets in terms of bonds this year -- and that's treasury bonds.  So I don't think you're going to see the immediate move from interest rates out of it.  It would be more of a lagging effect if it were to effect the economy.</p><p>VARNEY: Fair enough.  Jim Bianco, joining us from Chicago. Thanks so much, Jim.</p><p>BIANCO: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Stuart.</p><p>Now let's check in with some of our other reporters to see what they're working on for the hour.  We'll begin with Greg Clarkin -- Greg.</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A proposed $10 billion merger in the banking business is delayed as investigators look into a unit of RepublicNew York.  I'll let you know when Republic's deal with HSBC may close.</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Bruce Francis.  IBM once gave a contract to Intel and created a monster.  But now, IBM is vowing not to lose a second time in networking.</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Kelli Arena in Washington. Tonight, we celebrate one of the most influential inventions of our time.  There's just one problem.  We can't name the inventor -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Kelli.</p><p>Those stories coming up, plus a look at what's behind the run-up in Intel.</p><p>But first, a look at our \"News Digest.\" New details in the investigation of the raid on the Branch Davidian compound.  CNN has obtained FBI tapes from the day the siege ended.  On those tapes, the voice of an agent seeking and receiving permission from a commander to fire pyrotechnic devices at a bunker near the compound. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FBI AGENT: 10-4.  He thinks he can get into position with relative safety utilizing the track for cover and attempt to penetrate it with military rounds.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FBI AGENT: Roger.  Of course, if there's water underneath that's just going to extinguish them, but you can try it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAY: The FBI maintains the Davidians started the blaze, which killed 80 people, six years ago.</p><p>Well, it's no longer a hurricane, but still a menace for the Carolina coast.  On Hatteras Island, Dennis washed out the main highway, leaving 5,000 people stranded since Monday.  However, the news is getting better: power is being restored.</p><p>Out West, favorable weather conditions are helping firefighters save resort communities in San Bernardino, California.  Dozens of fires have swept across brush and forest land in six Western states.</p><p>And campaigning in Los Angeles, Republican front-runner George W. Bush declared education his top priority.  Among his proposals: taking federal money from under-performing schools, and instead, giving it to parents to educate their children as they choose.</p><p>VARNEY: More lives lost as East Timor chooses between independence and autonomy as part of Indonesia.  Just south of the capital, Dili, two U.N. workers died today in clashes between anti- independence fighters and separatists.  They are the latest casualties of violence triggered by Monday's referendum on the territory's future.  As vote-counting continues, the attacks are forcing thousands from their homes and prompting calls for U.N. peacekeepers.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE: much more on today's market and a look at some of the day's biggest movers.  Plus, the big board ponders a big question.</p><p>VARNEY: Should the stock marketplace go public?  That story and more just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's MONEYLINE \"Movers,\" Best Buy slid 10.5. The electronics retailer reported August sales rose 11 percent, compared to a near 18 percent gain a year ago.  3COM added more than 2.5 on what have been recurring takeover rumors.  The latest speculation involves Lucent as a possible bidder.  3COM refused to comment.  And COM21 tumbled and is now down more than 60 percent from its high.  An industry standards group refused to certify COM21's new cable modem.</p><p>BAY: In our corporate briefs, Boeing's machinists union approved a contract that's being called the \"best in aerospace,\" at least for the union.  The vote came last night, and averts a possible strike. Separately, Boeing is taking a $225 million charge.  The aerospace company blames a limited market for its F-15 fighter.</p><p>And trying to prevent the deal from collapsing, Global Crossing has upped its bid for Frontier.  The sweeter terms: $9 billion, a 12 percent increase.  Global Crossing has lost $12 billion in market value since it made its original offer.  Frontier shares barely budged, but Global Crossing fell another 1 9/16.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, after months of speculation, fresh news, tonight, on the big question about the Big Board.  Is it going public? Well, possibly, but not in November as expected.  The NYSE says it's committed to going public, but wants time to study issues related to a potential IPO.</p><p>Fred Katayama has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"NYSE ADVERTISEMENT\")</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: The New York Stock Exchange, a proud part of what makes this country tick.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The board of the New York Stock Exchange pledges to sell stock in itself to the world, putting an end to two centuries as a membership run organization.  The deadline, not late November as originally announced, but next year.</p><p>DICK GRASSO, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, NYSE: For those who have tread very carefully on whether their Thanksgiving Dinner was going to be interrupted, let me assure you that it clearly will not be.</p><p>The board today authorized the exchange to continue pursuit of the mutualization and public ownership.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Prompts the symbol of American capitalism to go public: competition.  Computerized trading networks like Instanet (ph) are eating into trading volume.</p><p>Proponents a public exchange can respond more quickly to changes in the market.  It would answer to shareholders, instead of seeking consensus from the conflicting interests of its members, who range from giants like Merrill Lynch to small outfits.</p><p>Plus, the Big Board can use stock to buy companies, including perhaps, an electronic trading network.  The biggest roadblock it'll face, regulatory issues.  But this IPO expert predicts, Dick Grasso will make the compromises needed to clear the way.</p><p>DAVID MENLOW, PRESIDENT, IPO FINANCIAL NETWORK: He will put his head in his hands, and say, tell us what you need to get done.  We will get it done.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATAYAMA: Currently, the NYSE regulates itself, but the Securities and Exchanges Commission says, for the Big Board to go public, the NYSE must separate its regulatory arm into a different unit -- Willow, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: \u2026 why does it want that separation in regulatory affairs?</p><p>KATAYAMA: Well, Columbia law professor Jack Coffee (ph) notes several reasons.  For one, a public company is supposed to make money. The problem is, a regulatory unit isn't profitable, so shareholders might not like that.  And plus, there is another problem: What if, for example, the regulatory arm were bring charges against the likes of Merrill Lynch?  Well, Merrill Lynch can just say hey, I'll just take my business somewhere else, to an electronic trading firm such as Instanet.</p><p>BAY: Now, are the plans to take the exchange public definite? Is that definitely going to happen?</p><p>KATAYAMA: Not a done deal yet, Stuart -- not -- Willow.  They want to look at certain issues like regulation and taxation, so not done deal.</p><p>BAY: OK, getting closer it seems.</p><p>VARNEY: Fred Katayama, thanks very much.</p><p>Now a footnote to that report: Only one Big Board specialist is publicly traded, and its performance leaves a lot to be desired. LaBranche, one of the largest and oldest specialists on Wall Street, went public about two weeks ago.  Today, it's trading below its IPO price.</p><p>Specialists, by the way, are firms that match buyers and sellers, and help to balance demand of -- demand for and supply of stocks.</p><p>BAY: Still to come on MONEYLINE, Big Blue maps out a strategy that could cut into Intel's new business.</p><p>VARNEY: And speaking on Intel, just how high can that flock -- stock fly?  \"FORTUNE\" columnist Andy Serwer has a few ideas on that, and we'll be back with him in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: The former chief executive of SGI has, indeed, landed at Microsoft.  Richard Belluzzo will head up the company's Internet operations.  But Microsoft president Steve Ballmer denied speculation that Belluzzo would orchestrate a spin-off of the unit.  Many technology insiders predicted Microsoft would find a well-known executive to run the Internet division, and then take it public.</p><p>VARNEY: Let's turn now, to another stock, Intel.  That stock gained another 1 7/8, today, to an all-time high.  \"FORTUNE\" columnist Andy Serwer, a MONEYLINE regular, has some thoughts now, on where it's headed from here.  And he joins us.</p><p>Andy, what have you got?</p><p>ANDY SERWER, \"FORTUNE\" MAGAZINE: Guys, really an incredible run by Intel.  I mean, it's not just today, it's the past couple months, it's the past 12 months.  The stock's up from the mid 50s to the mid 80s since June.  And really an incredible move for a company this big. You always think of Intel along with Microsoft and Cisco, Lucent -- as one of the big tech giants.  But traditionally, the stock has been a little different because it's had a lower PE and it's been more volatile.  I remember talking to Andy Grove, the former CEO of this company, the legendary CEO, and he'd ask me, \"Andy, why does my company have such a low PE?  Why is the stock so volatile?\" So it's been a problem -- maybe breaking out now.</p><p>BAY: It's been a tough stock for analysts to cover, in fact.</p><p>SERWER: Absolutely.  It's caused all kinds of headaches for Wall Street analysts, the most famous being Tom Kurlack (ph), the Merrill Lynch analyst.  I used to call him the dark prince, because he'd downgrade the stock and would get bashed.  And I tell you, about a year ago, he did that to the stock, only the funny thing was the stock didn't bash, it went north, it went about 45 percent to February, and then he left Merrill Lynch, some say because the stock went up counter to his call.  Recently, a couple analysts, Mark Edelstone (ph) and Charlie Glavin (ph) at CSFB, downgraded the stock -- some negative comments in June.  The stock has gone up since then.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, why has it gone up so much?</p><p>SERWER: Good question, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Thank you.</p><p>SERWER: And the reason there is, you know, all the chip stocks have been en fuego over the past couple months, and, you know, really it's about communication chips have been really hot and Intel is moving into that area.</p><p>VARNEY: New line of business.  OK.  Andy Serwer, many thanks.</p><p>SERWER: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: Intel may have some competition in its leading edge business thanks to a move by IBM today.  IBM unveiled a new initiative on chips for networking equipment.  After getting burned by Intel in the PC chip market, IBM wants to make sure it does not happen again in a different arena.</p><p>Bruce Francis reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS (voice-over): This time, IBM is not going to let a multi-billion-dollar business slip away to Intel.  That's what happened in 1978 when IBM selected Intel to supply microprocessors for the first IBM personal computers.  So a day after Intel said it was targeting the fast-growing market for communications chips, IBM is making a nearly identical announcement.  The subtitle: big blue won't be fooled again.</p><p>DAN KUNSTLER, TECH ANALYST, JP MORGAN: What they would rather not see happen is what happened in microprocessors for the personal computer industry, where by there was one architecture that was really the ownership of a single company, Intel, that ended up dominating and gaining a quasi-monopoly in the business.</p><p>FRANCIS: IBM and Intel have almost identical strategies.  Right now, devices like routers that help direct Internet traffic use specific chips for specific tasks.  Both IBM and Intel say no more. Instead, a new generation of microprocessor will power networking equipment with updated software delivered over the Internet.  The networking warriors have some of the biggest names in the business lined up in support.  Selling more of its technology is a key growth area for IBM.</p><p>CHRISTINE KING, V.P., IBM WIRED COMMS.: I think we're going to be over a-billion-dollar player in a couple of years, in this -- just specifically providing chips to the network.</p><p>FRANCIS: Experts say the market for networking equipment could be even more lucrative than that for PCs.</p><p>FRANK DZUBECK, COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK ARCHITECT: There's hundreds of millions of PCs, right.  But you can think of these network application devices are measured in billions, and that's not only here in the United States, it's billions throughout the world.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: IBM may have an advantage that money can't buy.  Dan Kunstler says that some networking companies are wary of Intel, concerned that if they become a supplier today, they will become a competitor tomorrow -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Well said.  Bruce Francis reporting.  Thanks, Bruce.</p><p>BAY: Next on MONEYLINE: a doom and gloom prediction from a Nobel Prize winning economist.</p><p>VARNEY: But don't cash in your mutual funds just yet.  Stay with us, please.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Well before Wall Street opened sharply lower today, a dire warning came from across the Atlantic.  In an interview today with a German newspaper, Nobel prize winning economist Milton Friedman said that the stock market was showing characteristics of a bubble. But the bull market faithfuls should take note.  About a year ago, Mr. Friedman said the same thing, comparing this bull market to 1929. Since then, the Dow is up 40 percent, the Nasdaq up 70 percent. BAY: And while today's session might have been nerve-racking for armchair investors, imagine what it was like for day traders.  You can get an idea right now at cnnfn.com, a special report on day trading, inside the fast-moving and controversial investment trend; that's at cnnfn.com.</p><p>VARNEY: Still to come on THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR: the selling resumes on Wall Street, the fear is that the Fed is not done raising rates.</p><p>BAY: Sears shows its softer side and gets hit hard.</p><p>VARNEY: Also, a bank merger may be in jeopardy.  Republic New York under the federal microscope.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Topping tonight's headlines: a hard day for Sears. Investors dumped the stock after a profit warning and an executive shuffle.  Another huge loser: Republic New York, the bank at the center of a federal investigation.  Question, what does that mean for its pending merger?  And then there's the Internet: Who deserves the credit for what's called one of history's greatest inventions?</p><p>BAY: But first our top story: another stock market pullback on Wall Street.  The Dow industrials wiped out almost all of yesterday's triple-digit rally and resumed its week-long slump.  Once again, it was fears of another interest rate hike that triggered today's sell- off.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Dow plunged more than 200 points before regaining some of its composure to close at 10843, down nearly 95 points.  Reigniting investors' concerns about inflation, remarks by Fed Governor Edward Kelley, who warns that investors should not assume the Federal Reserve is done raising rates this year.</p><p>HENRY CAVANNA, J.P. MORGAN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: Until this clarity on where we're headed.  If the economy does slow, how much does it slow? How much does the Fed have to raise rates? I mean, these are the issues, and they're going to play out, not over the next day, but over the next several months and several quarters.</p><p>LISOVICZ: A sell-off in the bond market also spooked investors, as did an earnings warnings from Dow component Sears.</p><p>Rate-sensitive financial stocks, such as J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan, were among the hardest hit.  While biotechs, like Medimmune, Genzyme and Amgen also suffered.  The Nasdaq pared much of its losses before finishing down 16 points to close at 2734.</p><p>Investors are looking ahead at tomorrow's monthly jobs reports, especially since today's weekly employment report showed strength.</p><p>JOHN EADE, ARGUS RESEARCH: What was at least as important was the jobless number that came out.  It was very low, suggesting that the jobs market is still quite tight, and that just raised the pressure on the nonfarm payrolls report.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ: Some analysts warn the sell-off could continue tomorrow, with the release of a stronger-than-expected job report, combined with traders unwilling to commit ahead of a three-day holiday weekend -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Susan, thanks.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Sure.</p><p>BAY: Well, taking a closer look behind today's sell-off: On the Big Board, decliners swamped advancers by a margin of five to two. And 22 stocks rose to new 52-week highs; 117 fell to new lows. Closing at 52-week highs, Texas Instruments and Intel, both up sharply.  Dow losers included Eastman Kodak, down more than 2, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, off 1-1/2.</p><p>VARNEY: And now the Dow's biggest loser: Sears.  Investors hammered the stock, already trading at a four-year low, after Sears warned its profits will fall well below forecasts.  Sears plunged nearly 3-3/4, that's 10 percent, and that was on five times daily average volume.  With that gloomy outlook came a management shakeup, one aimed at turning the troubled retailer around.</p><p>From Chicago, Ceci Rodgers reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For Sears, back to school means back to the drawing board.  The nation's second-largest retailer slashed its earnings estimates for the third quarter and the full year, blaming anemic sales and slimmer profit margins.</p><p>Sears' chief executive, Arthur Martinez, in Chicago to announce a new $30 million flagship store, got bombarded with questions about the earnings warning.</p><p>ARTHUR MARTINEZ, CEO, SEARS ROEBUCK: Our sales are not declining, our sales have flattened, and what we need to do is step back and look at our merchandising focus, look at our marketing programs and put some things together that put our sales growth back on the positive side of the ledger.</p><p>RODGERS: Shares of Sears plummeted nearly 10 percent to a fresh 52-week low, as several analysts downgraded the stock.  Wall Street is unimpressed with a new management structure that gets Martinez more involved day-to-day.</p><p>KURT BARNARD, BARNARD'S RETAIL TREND REPORT: He will have a hands-on personal involvement with the full-line stores, the kind that he had I would say about five years ago, when he turned the company around the first time.</p><p>RODGERS: While apparel has faltered at Sears, sales of appliances and other hard goods remain strong.  But analysts are losing patience, as Sears continues to lag the targets and gaps of the world.</p><p>STEVE KERNKRAUT, BEAR STEARNS: You got to figure out some way to get some excitement back in the store in much the same way that Old Navy has created excitement selling similar merchandise to what Sears has, and they've made it cool to shop Old Navy, and Sears has to figure out a way to make it cool to go back to Sears.</p><p>One key to Sears' strategy, a new ad campaign hitting the airwaves this month, just in time for the holidays.</p><p>(on camera): For retailers, the holiday season is the most crucial time of the year.  For Arthur Martinez, it's more than crucial.  Analysts say he has, at most, six months to turn things around at Sears or face being turned out himself.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers, CNN Financial News, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: While sales at Sears were flat last month, other retailers benefited from back-to-school shopping.  Even higher interest rates failed to drive shoppers away.  Sales at the nation's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, jumped more than 8 percent.  Sales at Kmart rose 3 percent.  But at JC Penney, they fell 3 percent.  The strongest gains were at clothing chains.  The Limited, Talbots and Gymboree all posted double-digit gains.</p><p>VARNEY: Now here's another thing for the Fed to worry about: labor costs.  The government today said they shot up 4.5 percent in the latest quarter, the biggest jump in five years.  Well, that fanned fears of another interest rate hike in the inflation-weary bond market.</p><p>The Treasury's 30-year issue tumbled 21/32 of a point in price, and that pushed the yield all the way back up to 6.12 percent, the highest level in three weeks</p><p>BAY: When we come back, more on the Fed and the markets.</p><p>VARNEY: Question: How will Wall Street react if Alan Greenspan raises rates again?</p><p>We'll ask Liz Mackay, when MONEYLINE continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus\": Wall Street and the Fed effect.  Last week, investors were convinced the Fed was through raising rates and drove the Dow to a new record.  Now that belief seems to have turned on a dime, and so has the market.</p><p>Joining me to make sense of these swings, Elizabeth Mackay of Bear Stearns.</p><p>Liz, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>ELIZABETH MACKAY, BEAR STEARNS: Thanks.  Good to be here.</p><p>BAY: We have seen this major mood swing and we've seen these significant declines.  Are we watching the market acknowledge that there will be another rate hike?</p><p>MACKAY: I think that's it.  I think today, basically the stock and the bond markets were discounting a Fed rate hike in October.</p><p>BAY: What about tomorrow?</p><p>MACKAY: I think if the wage portion of the employment report is much higher than expected, that does certainly raise the odds that the Fed will move in October.  But we don't think they'd move just because growth continued.</p><p>BAY: What is the Fed doing here?  Are they hiking rates to control the markets, if they raise rates?</p><p>MACKAY: In a way what the Fed is doing is constructive, not in terms of making it easier to profit in the stock market.  But the Fed is saying the world is a better place economically than it was at this time last year.  They lowered rates three times last year.  We don't need all of that Fed liquidity.  They don't have to be as accommodative.  The world is returning more to a normal status.</p><p>BAY: Well, most folks are expecting a tough day tomorrow. Really everybody is looking toward next week.  What do you think we'll see when everybody returns to work on Tuesday?  Will we see signs of, hey, this is a great opportunity, or let's get out of here?</p><p>MACKAY: I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of a bias to the upside.  We of course came down, we posted a low in the stock market in August, low in the bond market, rallied a little bit here, wasn't a terribly convincing rally, and we're coming back down I think basically to retest those lows around 10500, say, in terms of the Dow. So I think there is a very good chance that we'll hold at those levels.</p><p>BAY: How important is that reaction next week to the next couple of months?</p><p>MACKAY: I think it's probably important in the short term, but again, I think as we go into this Fed meeting, that is the intense focus, and I think we'll probably, as we saw last time, going to have that discounted before we get there.</p><p>BAY: Do you see buying opportunities here?</p><p>MACKAY: I think we've had kind of a knee-jerk reaction, Fed tightened, economy is going to slow down.  We don't think it's going to slow down appreciably.  And some of the cyclical stocks, for example, that have been thrown overboard in the metals area, and Alcoa or a Phelps Dodge we think could do very well.  The rest of the world is getting better economically.  Some of the consumer multinationals would be a way to play that better economy as well, like a Procter &amp; Gamble or Avon.</p><p>BAY: Let me ask you a question about Sears today.  What do you make of the market reaction to that?</p><p>MACKAY: This is a market that's earnings driven.  It's no longer liquidity driven.  And we think, for the general market, earnings are very solid.  Fundamentals are good.  But you're going to see stocks taken out and punished.</p><p>BAY: And what about -- sticking with the Sears issue, what about other retailers?  I mean, we've seen some strong numbers for August, but are we going to see some bumpy times ahead?</p><p>MACKAY: I think the problem is we have a real disparity with respect to valuations and the retailers.  The retailers that we feel we can count on have high confidence, have multiples or PE ratios that reflect that high level of confidence, and some of the stocks that are cheap have been more disappointing.  So we think it's going to be an area, maybe a little less than a market performer for the rest of the year.</p><p>BAY: Let's look ahead a bit.  If there is a third rate hike, what do you think happens?</p><p>MACKAY: I think by the time we get to October 5 the stock and the bond markets will have factored that in.  So I think it will be anti-climactic.</p><p>BAY: Really?  So you think for the fourth quarter we'll be in OK shape?</p><p>MACKAY: We think if the Fed does move in October, and we still doubt that\u2026</p><p>BAY: You do doubt that?  Now that's interesting, why do you doubt that?  It seems like obviously the tide has turned, and more and more folks are assuming that they will.  Why do you doubt it?</p><p>MACKAY: I think there will be much more caution taken, if that's the right word, or more reluctance to make the third step than the first and the second step.  We really haven't seen the inflation data that we think it would convince the Fed they really have to move. There is weak enough growth without inflation.</p><p>BAY: There is obviously two arguments to the Y2K issue.  But now folks are saying, now, wait a minute, the Fed is not going to act or not act, more importantly, based on pure speculation about Y2K.  How do you read the Fed reading of Y2K?</p><p>MACKAY: I think, in fact, if anything, Y2K may stay the Fed's hand.  They have to be ready if they need to provide liquidity, and in fact, I think as we go forward we may start to see the dollar becoming attractive again, or more of a -- kind of a flight to safety into dollar assets.  I think there is much more confidence that the U.S. is compliant in terms of year 2000 probably than any other country in the world.  So I think, if nothing else, we'll start to see money moving into treasuries and the dollar.</p><p>BAY: Liz Mackay, thanks as always for joining us on MONEYLINE.</p><p>MACKAY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BAY: Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Thanks, Willow.  Coming up on MONEYLINE: the investigation that is delaying a takeover worth billions.  An Asian buyer waits in the wings for a New York bank, as the questions fly.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Another firing at the Bank of New York tonight, as the fallout from an investigation into alleged Russian money-laundering continues.  The bank today dismissed an employee from its Eastern European unit.  She was allegedly fired for not cooperating with investigators.  Last week, a Russian-born vice president in the same unit also lost her job.  Federal officials believe the Bank of New York was used to launder billions in Russian funds.  The bank has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p><p>BAY: Another bank mired in scandal tonight: Republic New York. This one involves an allegedly inflated investment fund, Japanese clients, and a merger on the rocks.  Investigators want to know if Republic violated securities laws, but what concerns investors is whether the investigation will torpedo HSBC's buyout of Republic.  The stock fell more than $7.</p><p>Greg Clarkin reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN (voice-over): HSBC's $10.3 billion takeover of Republic New York bank will be delayed as investigators dig into possible wrongdoing at Republic's securities unit.  Regulators from the U.S. and Japan want to know if executives at the unit inflated the value of an investment fund, a fund in which Japanese investors reportedly may have sunk up to $1 billion.  The banks had planned to close their merger October 1.</p><p>JOHN COFFEE, DEAN, COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL: I think anyone who is looking at acquiring a firm that may have even a marginal role in a potential fraud, where as much as $1 billion may have been lost by innocent investors, has got to be very nervous.  Because once a fraud starts to unravel, authorities necessarily look for aiders and abettors, bystanders, anyone with a deep pocket who can be held liable.</p><p>CLARKIN: Analysts say the chain of events began with institutional investors in Japan placing money with the investment company of Cresvale International.  The money then went to Princeton Global Management, the ones who did the actual investing.  Republic Securities had custody of the money for Princeton Global.</p><p>The question now is: Did executives at Republic overstate the value of the investments?  If so, legal experts say Republic New York, as the parent company, is ultimately liable.  Investors punished shares of Republic, driving it 10 percent lower in heavy trading. Analysts say the shares could remain weak until the investigations are closed.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: A spokeswoman for Republic says at least two executives at its securities unit have been suspended due to the investigation. She vows the merger with SBC is still on track.  However, now she's predicting it will close just before the end of the year -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: How likely is it that it will actually close?</p><p>CLARKIN: At this point, Willow, it's tough to say.  There's still a lot of dust that has to settle here, and everybody involved from the banks' folks to the folks that play the stocks are saying that it's just too early really to see the severity of this investigation.</p><p>BAY: Greg Clarkin, thank you.</p><p>CLARKIN: Sure.</p><p>VARNEY: Some other stocks people were talking about today: Tech Data, for example, way down more than 7 points.  The computer equipment distributor says price cutting in Europe is eating into profits.  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals down more than 2.  Procter &amp; Gamble said it would stop helping Regeneron to develop its diet drug, Axokind (ph), because of negative test results.  Lonestar Industries shot up more than 14 1/2.  Germany's Dikerhoff is buying the cement maker for $1.2 billion, $50 dollars a share.  Rambus down 4 3/4. Intel adopted a chip technology that's less powerful than Rambus and less expensive.</p><p>BAY: That trouble with Rambus cast a shadow over the rest of the communications chip sector today, even though many analysts called the Rambus sell-off an overreaction, and reiterated buys on the stock. Here's the damage: Broadcom down nearly 3 3/4.  Conexant lost 3.  PMC Sierra fell 2 7/8.  And Galileo Technology off 1 1/4.</p><p>VARNEY: Up next, some of the day's other corporate headlines.</p><p>BAY: And how much were you worth at the tender age of 30?</p><p>VARNEY: Don't ask.</p><p>BAY: Who's who of America's young rich, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAY: After the stock market closed, Pepsico said it expects to report lower income for its North American operations in the third quarter.  Pepsi blamed lower case volume, but says earnings per share will be higher because of strength at its Frito-Lay and Tropicana units.</p><p>VARNEY: In other corporate headlines, Ford says August was just about as good as it gets.  Like its rivals, the automaker reported very strong sales, up more than 8 percent.</p><p>The Justice Department approved Fleet's merger with Bank Boston, but there are very long strings attached.  The bank must sell more than $13 billion in deposits at more than 300 branches.  It's the largest divestiture ever for a bank merger.</p><p>BAY: A story now that's either depressing or inspiring, depending on how you look at it and how old you are.  \"Fortune\" magazine has compiled a list of the richest young turks in corporate America: the 40 wealthiest people under 40.</p><p>Michael Dell, the 34-year-old wunderkind and CEO of Dell Computer, tops the list with $21 billion.  He is followed by Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, Gateway's Ted Waitt, Pierre Omidyar of eBay, and David Filo of Yahoo!  The top five are all men, so now it's not just depressing if you're young or old.  It's depressing for females.</p><p>And so is the rest of the list: 35 of them made their fortunes in technology.  And this is sort of interesting, 11 never finished college.</p><p>VARNEY: There's a cute little editorial or comment there, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Just a little editorial aside.  You don't mind here when we do that, not much.</p><p>VARNEY: Read the script.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAY: Up next, a pioneer who made all these 30-something billionaires.  A hint -- not Al Gore.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VARNEY: Very correct.  But first, \"Ahead of the Curve\": some of what you need to know tonight before tomorrow's markets open.</p><p>BAY: MONEYLINE will be back in 40 seconds.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Tomorrow's is the Friday before a long holiday weekend, but there could still be some real fireworks on Wall Street.  That's because the government releases what's considered the most important economic report of the month: the employment report. Economists predict the unemployment rate would fall slightly to 4.2 percent and that corporate America created more than 200,000 new jobs.  The bond trading pits will probably be hopping in the morning, but they'll close early, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>BAY: And don't miss MONEYLINE's special Friday feature: \"The Bottom Line.\" This time we'll look inside American Airlines: labor issues, an alleged smuggling ring, and customer complaints.  Should you own the stock?</p><p>That's tomorrow night at 6:30 Eastern.</p><p>VARNEY: All right.  Finally tonight, a controversy over paternity that cannot be answered with a simple DNA test.  Oh, no. Today is the 30th birthday of the Internet.  At least some members of the digital elite claim it is.  And not only is their debate over when it was born; there's no consensus on who deserves the title, father of the Internet.</p><p>Kelli Arena reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARENA (voice-over): When you hear the name Thomas Edison, what comes to mind?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The lightbulb.</p><p>ARENA: How about Alexander Graham Bell?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Telephone.</p><p>ARENA: Fast forward more than 100 years.  Who invented the Internet?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Joe Brown?  We don't know.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's Bill Gates, I'm telling you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Al Gore.  Everybody knows that.</p><p>ARENA: As the saying goes, success has many fathers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MARCH 9)</p><p>ALBERT GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I took the initiative in creating the Internet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARENA: There are those who take the credit, and those who do the work.</p><p>LEONARD KLEINROCK, UCLA: I'm not the father.  I'm a father, at best.</p><p>ARENA: But Leonard Kleinrock is known as the father of the Internet.  Actually, he was part of a team that took the first step in getting a computer hooked to a router on September 2, 1969.</p><p>But the first time one computer actually talked to another took place on October 20th of that year: hence some confusion over the Internet's actual birthdate.</p><p>KLEINROCK: The general public didn't even know about it.  What's more interesting is that it met with this deafening lack of response from my colleagues.</p><p>ARENA: Hardly the reception for what has revolutionized the communications world like nothing before.</p><p>VINT CERF, MCIWORLDCOM: We knew we needed to connect a lot of computers together in order to share the resources among the computer science departments that were funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</p><p>ARENA: With the Vietnam War raging, military planners worried that an enemy strike knocking out any key computer would cause havoc, and a decentralized network that let data flow in different directions seemed like the answer.</p><p>The Pentagon probably didn't have this in mind when it funded the Internet, but by all accounts, it was an effort well worth it.</p><p>Kelli Arena, CNN Financial News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: That's MONEYLINE for this Thursday.

It was the Nasdaq's worst day since February 8.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow fell as much as 493 points. The average closed down 336 points, or 1.4%, and is back in negative territory for the year. </p><p>Big tech companies, including Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, have powered the market's climb, but all four slipped Monday. The S&amp;P's tech sector fell 2.1% and was the worst performing sector on the index. </p><p>Facebook is under pressure from lawmakers in both the United States and the UK after more than 50 million users' data ended up in the hands of data firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>\"When you have real damage to a large enough company, that translates into the indexes as a whole,\" Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, said. </p><p>Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has called on Zuckerberg to appear before Congress to testify about \"what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters.\" John Kennedy, a Republican senator from Louisiana, joined Klobuchar in calling for Zuckerberg to testify.</p><p>Investors worry that new regulations on Facebook or an exodus of users from the platform could slow down one of the world's most valuable companies and chill the tech sector's rise. </p><p>\"Investors are questioning [Facebook's] growth potential. As a result, they are willing to take profits,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. </p><p>Facebook's losses had a cascading effect on the market. Wall Street's volatility index, known as the VIX, spiked 25%. CNNMoney's Fear and Greed Index, a measure of market sentiment, sunk deeper into extreme fear territory. </p><p>Wall Street is also weighing President Trump's next move on trade with China and the first Federal Reserve meeting with Chairman Jay Powell at the helm beginning Wednesday.</p><p>The White House confirmed to CNN last week that the administration is considering tariffs on at least $30 billion worth of imports from China. The move would be retaliation for alleged Chinese technology intellectual property theft. Trump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, setting off fears of a wider trade fight that could threaten the economy.</p><p>On Monday, 49 of the nation's largest retailers, including Walmart, Target and Costco, said new tariffs would hurt consumers. </p><p>\"As you continue to investigate harmful technology and intellectual property practices, we ask that any remedy carefully consider the impact on consumer prices,\" the letter stated. </p><p>Investors are also preparing for the Fed to raise rates when it meets Wednesday for a two-day policy conference. CME Group predicts a 94% chance the Fed hikes rates by a quarter percentage point.</p><p>\"We have a lot more uncertainty with respect to the Fed than we've had in years,\" McMillan said. \"Everyone believes Chair Powell is similar to Chair Yellen, but we don't really know.\"</p><p>McMillan argued the Fed's path to gradually normalize interest rates, which have been at historical lows since the 2008 financial crisis, is a sign of the economy's strength. </p><p>\"This is essentially the Fed endorsing the fact that the market is growing. I think the market reaction ultimately would end up being positive.\"</p><p>Stovall of CFRA Research is projecting the Fed will raise interest rates three times in 2018, but investors have left open the possibility of a fourth. </p><p>Higher interest rates bring down the value of stocks by making borrowing costs higher for companies. As rates climb higher, returns in the bond market can start looking more appealing than riskier stocks.</p><p>-CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed to this story.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The S&amp;P's tech sector fell 2.1% and was the worst performing sector on the index.</p><p>Facebook is under pressure from lawmakers in both the United States and the UK after more than 50 million users' data ended up in the hands of data firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p/><p>\"When you have real damage to a large enough company, that translates into the indexes as a whole,\" Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, said.</p><p>Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has called on Zuckerberg to appear before Congress to testify about \"what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters.\" John Kennedy, a Republican senator from Louisiana, joined Klobuchar in calling for Zuckerberg to testify.</p><p/><p>Investors worry that new regulations on Facebook or an exodus of users from the platform could slow down one of the world's most valuable companies and chill the tech sector's rise.</p><p>\"Investors are questioning [Facebook's] growth potential. As a result, they are willing to take profits,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.</p><p>Facebook's losses had a cascading effect on the market. Wall Street's volatility index, known as the VIX, spiked 25%. CNNMoney's Fear and Greed Index, a measure of market sentiment, sunk deeper into extreme fear territory.</p><p>Wall Street is also weighing President Trump's next move on trade with China and the first Federal Reserve meeting with Chairman Jay Powell at the helm beginning Wednesday.</p><p>The White House confirmed to CNN last week that the administration is considering tariffs on at least $30 billion worth of imports from China. The move would be retaliation for alleged Chinese technology intellectual property theft. Trump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, setting off fears of a wider trade fight that could threaten the economy.</p><p/><p>On Monday, 49 of the nation's largest retailers, including Walmart, Target and Costco, said new tariffs would hurt consumers.</p><p>\"As you continue to investigate harmful technology and intellectual property practices, we ask that any remedy carefully consider the impact on consumer prices,\" the letter stated.</p><p>Investors are also preparing for the Fed to raise rates when it meets Wednesday for a two-day policy conference. CME Group predicts a 94% chance the Fed hikes rates by a quarter percentage point.</p><p/><p>\"We have a lot more uncertainty with respect to the Fed than we've had in years,\" McMillan said. \"Everyone believes Chair Powell is similar to Chair Yellen, but we don't really know.\"</p><p>McMillan argued the Fed's path to gradually normalize interest rates, which have been at historical lows since the 2008 financial crisis, is a sign of the economy's strength.</p><p>\"This is essentially the Fed endorsing the fact that the market is growing. I think the market reaction ultimately would end up being positive.\"</p><p>Stovall of CFRA Research is projecting the Fed will raise interest rates three times in 2018, but investors have left open the possibility of a fourth.</p><p>Higher interest rates bring down the value of stocks by making borrowing costs higher for companies. As rates climb higher, returns in the bond market can start looking more appealing than riskier stocks.</p><p>?CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed to this story.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180319stock-market-dow-jones-facebook1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX6-PY01-JBPX-W079-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><timeReceived>4:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009HXC</classCode><className>COMMONWEALTH EQUITY SERVICES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009FYX</classCode><className>CME GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The 2008 financial crisis inspired the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Could the backlash against Big Tech result in a standalone government agency devoted to securing our digital data? Marc Rotenberg, a Georgetown Law professor and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, is helping lead a push to create that kind of federally funded watchdog. </p><p>Facebook, Google, and other Silicon Valley giants have long operated under the tech-friendly purview of the Federal Trade Commission, which doesn't even have the authority to enforce privacy obligations. Indeed, as consumers grow increasingly alarmed by abuses of private information and high-profile data breaches, the United States remains one of the few advanced Western democracies without a dedicated regulator. \"A lot of people in Washington wake up and say, 'How do we protect our nation's security? How do we keep our drinking water clean?' \" says Rotenberg. \"But remarkably, there's really nobody playing that role on privacy.\"</p><p>A serious but chatty privacy-law junkie who works out of a Dupont Circle office, Rotenberg began backing this idea in 1990. Yes, nearly 30 years ago: Long before Mark Zuckerberg cooked up Facebook in his Harvard dorm room, Rotenberg was promoting greater safeguards for personal information, whether helping draft new privacy laws as counsel for Vermont senator Patrick Leahy or testifying in front of Congress about the benefits of a federal data-privacy agency. Obviously, the need has only grown more urgent as the digital age has dramatically increased the dangers associated with intrusive businesses and cybercriminals.</p><p>So what would such an agency look like? In Rotenberg's view, it would direct the government's efforts to identify threats to our data, investigate complaints from consumers, and ensure the fair use of tech algorithms. It would also serve as the nation's chief advocate for stronger data protections. </p><p>The idea has gained momentum in recent months, and Rotenberg has been advising the staffs of Congress members Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren on legislation they recently introduced to create a data-protection agency. Despite the long odds that it will be enacted, Rotenberg says data-privacy concerns are-or at least should be-nonpartisan. \"And that,\" he says, \"is a reason to be optimistic.\"</p><h>-Luke Mullins</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photograph of Zuckerberg by Chip Somodevilla/Getty</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHTN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHTN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMY-5991-DYWP-900G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11412</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"427\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Washington Magazine, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonian</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The U.S. needs a federal agency focused on privacy protection, compliance with data protection obligations, and emerging privacy challenges. The agency should also examine the social, ethical, social, and economic impacts of high-risk data processing and oversee impact-assessment obligations.\"</p><p>The privacy framework also calls for increased transparency of algorithms used by social media giants like Facebook, search engines like Google and fintech companies, and seeks to limit government access to consumer data.</p><p>The consumer groups released the framework almost two months after the FTC testified before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and asked for greater rulemaking authority to crack down on Big Tech, the authority to fine tech companies for privacy violations, and more resources to tackle privacy issues.</p><p>Given the FTC's apparent willingness to hold tech companies accountable for misconduct, especially when involving consumer data protection, the American Enterprise Institute's Visiting Scholar Roslyn Layton thinks a new data protection agency is unnecessary and a waste of resources.</p><p>\"FTC as a federal agency offers tremendous taxpayer value -- they handle literally millions and millions of consumer complaints every year,\" Layton told InsideSources. \"The conversation should really be about strengthening the FTC, not punishing it.\"</p><p>Regarding the FTC's failure to enforce the 2011 consent decree, Layton thinks that is the Obama administration's fault for cozying up to Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"There is a fair critique to say hey, they didn't enforce this consent decree on the big players, and I would attribute that to the Obama administration which was very close to the tech industry, that's how they came to power,\" she said. \"That's always an issue, but that's part of why you have two parties on the commission.\"</p><p>Aram Sinnreich, chair of communication studies at American University, takes a different view. Because the FTC's primary responsibility is to regulate trade and competition, he said, a new agency is better suited to regulate privacy.</p><p>\"Having a dedicated agency whose one sole purpose is policing the integrity of consumer citizen data is a great idea,\" he told InsideSources. \"It would be less susceptible to regulatory capture and have less conflict of interest in terms of interpreting what its function is and hopefully less susceptible to the vagaries of political pendulum swings. So I love that.\"</p><p>Sinnreich thinks the FTC often fails to truly punish companies for wrongdoing, partly because industry leaders frequently become FTC commissioners and vice versa, confusing the objectives of the commission.</p><p>\"Part of it has to do with political philosophies of trade that vary from administration to administration,\" Sinnreich said. \"Sometimes you're going to have a more cautious, consumer-friendly administration and sometimes a more light-touch, business-friendly administration. That's an issue that needs to be separate from the area of data privacy and security, which is essential to a functional democracy.\"</p><p>Because consumer data protection and privacy issues are not trade issues, the FTC doesn't really have a responsibility to regulate them.</p><p>\"It's not just about trade, it's about functional democracy, human rights, civil rights, free speech,\" Sinnreich said. \"The issues that are raised by the flow of consumer data between state, commercial and criminal entities, are much broader than trade issues. It's the kind of challenge that's more appropriate for an independent agency to address.\"</p><p>At the same time, many tech companies' business models rely on the flow of consumer data -- including Facebook, Google, and fintech companies like SoFi and Kabbage, which use consumer data to provide and consolidate different kinds of loans. Because consumer data and the modern tech industry depend on one another, Layton argues, the FTC does have jurisdiction over consumer data protection.</p><p>\"This notion that consumer interests and market interests are conflicted, that's not necessarily the case,\" she said. \"Consumers have benefited tremendously as a result of the online economy, and there's multiple views on consumer interests.\"</p><p>Congress hasn't signaled whether it plans to set up a new agency to regulate consumer data protection or privacy, in fact, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation unanimously confirmed that the FTC should be the primary enforcer of any future privacy laws.</p><p>Multiple senators including Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) introduced data protection bills over the last few months, reinforcing FTC authority and strengthening consumer data privacy.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.
