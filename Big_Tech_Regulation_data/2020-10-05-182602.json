But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.</p><p>\"We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.</p><p>\"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\"</p><p>In the last year Facebook has come under intense pressure over some of its business practices, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a series of data breaches and concerns over fake news and other content on the site.</p><p>The committee's final report into disinformation and fake news also said electoral law was \"not fit for purpose\" and should be updated to reflect the move to \"microtargeted\" online political campaigning.</p><p>They called for a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations surrounding political work during elections and referenda, and separately urged the Government to put pressure on social media companies to publicise instances of disinformation.</p><p>Ministers were also asked to reveal how many investigations are being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics.</p><p>The report is the latest attempt to crack down on social media networks, and follows accusations from digital minister Margot James that some firms show little regard for the security and safety of some of their more vulnerable users.</p><p>The issue has come under increased focus following the case of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who took her life aged 14, after her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account following her death.</p><p>The Government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.</p><p>Tory MP and committee chairman Damian Collins said: \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.</p><p>\"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.</p><p>\"We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people.

We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy.</p><p>\"Few individuals have shown contempt for our parliamentary democracy in the way Mark Zuckerberg has. If one thing is uniting politicians of all colours during this difficult time for our country, it is our determination to bring him and his company into line.\"</p><p>A Government spokesman said: \"This week the Culture Secretary will travel to the United States to meet with tech giants including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple to discuss many of these issues.</p><p>\"We welcome this report's contribution towards our work to tackle the increasing threat of disinformation and to make the UK the safest place to be online. We will respond in due course.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, said: \"We're pleased with the committee's support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clarify how personal data should be used during political campaigning.

But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.</p><p>\"We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.</p><p>\"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\"</p><p>In the last year Facebook has come under intense pressure over some of its business practices, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a series of data breaches and concerns over fake news and other content on the site.</p><p>The committee's final report into disinformation and fake news also said electoral law was \"not fit for purpose\" and should be updated to reflect the move to \"microtargeted\" online political campaigning.</p><p>They called for a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations surrounding political work during elections and referenda, and separately urged the Government to put pressure on social media companies to publicise instances of disinformation.</p><p>Ministers were also asked to reveal how many investigations are being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics.</p><p>The report is the latest attempt to crack down on social media networks, and follows accusations from digital minister Margot James that some firms show little regard for the security and safety of some of their more vulnerable users.</p><p>The issue has come under increased focus following the case of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who took her life aged 14, after her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account following her death.</p><p>The Government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.</p><p>Tory MP and committee chairman Damian Collins said: \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.</p><p>\"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.</p><p>\"We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people.

We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy.</p><p>\"Few individuals have shown contempt for our parliamentary democracy in the way Mark Zuckerberg has. If one thing is uniting politicians of all colours during this difficult time for our country, it is our determination to bring him and his company into line.\"</p><p>A Government spokesman said: \"This week the Culture Secretary will travel to the United States to meet with tech giants including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple to discuss many of these issues.</p><p>\"We welcome this report's contribution towards our work to tackle the increasing threat of disinformation and to make the UK the safest place to be online. We will respond in due course.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, said: \"We're pleased with the committee's support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clarify how personal data should be used during political campaigning.

But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.</p><p>\"We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.</p><p>\"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\"</p><p>In the last year Facebook has come under intense pressure over some of its business practices, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a series of data breaches and concerns over fake news and other content on the site.</p><p>The committee's final report into disinformation and fake news also said electoral law was \"not fit for purpose\" and should be updated to reflect the move to \"microtargeted\" online political campaigning.</p><p>They called for a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations surrounding political work during elections and referenda, and separately urged the Government to put pressure on social media companies to publicise instances of disinformation.</p><p>Ministers were also asked to reveal how many investigations are being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics.</p><p>The report is the latest attempt to crack down on social media networks, and follows accusations from digital minister Margot James that some firms show little regard for the security and safety of some of their more vulnerable users.</p><p>The issue has come under increased focus following the case of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who took her life aged 14, after her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account following her death.</p><p>The Government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.</p><p>Tory MP and committee chairman Damian Collins said: \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day.

But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.</p><p>\"We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.</p><p>\"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\"</p><p>In the last year Facebook has come under intense pressure over some of its business practices, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a series of data breaches and concerns over fake news and other content on the site.</p><p>The committee's final report into disinformation and fake news also said electoral law was \"not fit for purpose\" and should be updated to reflect the move to \"microtargeted\" online political campaigning.</p><p>They called for a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations surrounding political work during elections and referenda, and separately urged the Government to put pressure on social media companies to publicise instances of disinformation.</p><p>Ministers were also asked to reveal how many investigations are being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics.</p><p>The report is the latest attempt to crack down on social media networks, and follows accusations from digital minister Margot James that some firms show little regard for the security and safety of some of their more vulnerable users.</p><p>The issue has come under increased focus following the case of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who took her life aged 14, after her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account following her death.</p><p>The Government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.</p><p>Tory MP and committee chairman Damian Collins said: \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.</p><p>\"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.</p><p>\"We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people.

We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy.</p><p>\"Few individuals have shown contempt for our parliamentary democracy in the way Mark Zuckerberg has. If one thing is uniting politicians of all colours during this difficult time for our country, it is our determination to bring him and his company into line.\"</p><p>A Government spokesman said: \"This week the Culture Secretary will travel to the United States to meet with tech giants including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple to discuss many of these issues.</p><p>\"We welcome this report's contribution towards our work to tackle the increasing threat of disinformation and to make the UK the safest place to be online. We will respond in due course.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, said: \"We're pleased with the committee's support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clarify how personal data should be used during political campaigning.

The Govern-ment is not expected to unveil its full duty of care plans until the spring although the findings from its consultation on last April's White Paper will be published today. \"This is a staging post,\" said a source.</p><p>It will, however, pledge to protect free speech amid fears that too draconian a regime could stifle legal comments that might cause offence but not harm.</p><p>The legislation will cover firms which have user-generated comments online although Ofcom will be tasked to draw up guidelines to advise companies on who might be affected and how.</p><p>Codes of conduct setting out what companies will be expected to do to meet their duty of care will be drawn up and policed by Ofcom, with the Home Office leading on terror and child abuse.</p><p>Today's announcement will be one of Lady Morgan's last acts as Culture Secretary before she leaves in tomorrow's Cabinet reshuffle, the third politician to hold the post in just 18 months. John Carr, the secretary of the Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety, said it was critical for the regulator to have power to block sites, otherwise \"it will effectively be defanged before its creation\".</p><p>The father of Molly Russell, the 14-year-old schoolgirl who took her own life after viewing self-harm images on Instagram, said the new regulator needed to be able to take services offline that repeatedly failed in their duty of care.</p><p>Ian Russell said: \"Cases like Molly's highlight the need for the Government's online harm legislation to be implemented quickly, with effective and proportionate sanctions against those that persistently fail to protect children and vulnerable people from harm.</p><p>\"Ultimately the regulator must be able to take down services that fail in their duty of care by repeatedly distributing harmful content.\"</p><p>Mr Russell, who has previously accused Instagram of \"helping to kill\" his daughter, also called for Ofcom to be given interim enforcement powers to \"prevent misery and help save lives\" as soon as possible.</p><p>In the Conservative manifesto and Queen's Speech, Boris Johnson pledged the Government would legislate to \"make the UK the safest place in the world to be online\".</p><p>The Daily Telegraph has campaigned since the summer of 2018 for a statutory duty of care to do more to protect children from online harms.</p><p>Andy Burrows, the NSPCC's head of child safety online policy, said: \"Any regulator will only succeed if it has the power to hit rogue companies hard in the pocket and hold named directors criminally accountable for putting children at risk on their sites.</p><p>\"Boris Johnson can protect families and support law enforcement by standing firm against some of the world's most powerful companies.

That seems to be the question many are asking today. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be particularly worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse: Companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter control the very channels through which people get their news and organize to act politically. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.</p><p>As Wu writes: \"Big tech is ubiquitous, seems to know too much about us, and seems to have too much power over what we see, hear, do and even feel. It has reignited debates over who really rules, when the decisions of just a few people have great influence over everyone.\"</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy. Big Tech should be worried.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The Social Media Upheaval,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds</p><p>Columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Columnist</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRESUN-bng-1857531983</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRESUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8H-DCD1-DYJJ-P1MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257492</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Press &amp;

Subodh Gupta[6], an influential Indian artist whose works are often auctioned for millions of dollars, is suing the as-yet-unknown users of an Instagram handle called HerdSceneAnd for civil defamation and 50 million rupees (approximately $700,000) in damages.The HerdSceneAnd[7] handle popped up on Instagram last year as a platform for women to share experiences of abuse and harassment in India's art world. Anonymous testimonies on the handle accused Gupta of a range of misconduct ranging from inappropriate sexual comments to unwanted, persistent advances and inappropriate touching. Gupta has denied the allegations.On Sept. </p><p>20, 2019, Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw ordered Facebook to provide 'the particulars of the person behind the Instagram account' in a sealed envelope in time for the next hearing on Nov. 18 this year.Facebook, which owns Instagram, has declined to comment on what it will do next. But the social media giant's decisions in India next month could have wide-ranging effects on the privacy and anonymity of the over 2.4 billion[8] users of Facebook, WhatsApp[9] and Instagram across the world.Any user information that Facebook puts before Indian courts is likely to fuel a raging debate on the magnitude and granularity of data that big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon[10] routinely gather about us all, and how this data is deployed.In the recent past, social media giants have been only too happy to portray themselves as guardians of free speech and expression[11] in the face of repressive regimes. As recently as July 2019, Twitter referenced #MeTooIndia in a glitzy consumer campaign[12] intended to showcase the power of the platform.Unmasking the collective behind the HerdSceneAnd Instagram account is likely to undermine claims that these platforms serve a higher social purpose.'Anonymity is the real way whistleblowers, political dissidents, people who have experienced systemic harassment and abuse make their voice heard in societies which do not share their values,' Apar Gupta, a lawyer with the Internet Freedom Foundation, an Indian digital rights advocacy group, told HuffPost India, adding that such harm often happens precisely because the 'victim is someone who lacks power in a particular setting.'Thus far, the Delhi High Court has only asked for information about HerdSceneAnd's operators. Should Facebook comply, the lawyer said, the company might find itself receiving more detailed requests for information. This may include all correspondence through the account, which could expose the identities of women who shared their testimonies of harassment with HerdSceneAnd.Anonymity, supporters of India's Me Too movement have said, is essential to protect survivors of sexual harassment and assault.'This defamation suit against @herdsceneand is an outright move to silence the survivors and gag the platform that gave them a voice while protecting their identities,' said a statement of solidarity, circulated over email and signed by at least 38 women journalists and artists. 'This is exactly what survivors have feared when choosing anonymity. This is an attempt to dissuade others from sharing further experiences of harassment and violence, and to perpetuate a culture of fear.'Facebook declined to respond to HuffPost India's questions.'We will not be able to comment as the matter is sub judice. Facebook remains committed to complying with applicable laws,' a Facebook representative said in an email.Neoma Vasdev, a lawyer for Subodh Gupta, the artist in question, also declined HuffPost India's requests for comment. Silencing Free Speech Online Technology companies have a stated policy of assisting law enforcement agencies with investigations, (see, for example, Instagram's privacy policy[13]), but privacy experts and rights activists are watching this case closely to see just how far Facebook will go to reveal the people behind HerdSceneAnd.The Instagram handle, according to court documents, is linked to an anonymous email ID \u2014 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:herdscene@gmail.com\">herdscene@gmail.com</email> \u2014 meaning Facebook could simply pass the buck on to Google, which could be the next in line to receive a court order.;Or, Facebook could start diving into the voluminous archives of user data it collects across WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram to zero in on a list of likely users. It is common practice for Facebook and Google to assign unique advertiser IDs to users (here is how to reset yours[14]), but insist that the data is anonymized and can't be used to identify individual users. Privacy experts have disputed these claims.Interestingly, Instagram's public position in the United States says the platform may share Internet Protocol (IP) addresses[15] of users if the company is served 'a valid subpoena issued in connection with an official criminal investigation.'IP addresses, privacy experts say, are often gateways to a wealth of user information. In 2013, the Indian government ordered[16] all Internet Service Providers to maintain detailed logs of IP activity of Indian internet users for a minimum of one year. These logs must include a user's name, address and contact number \u2014 data that Internet users must provide to service providers when signing up for a connection.'People tend to have this perception that they are anonymous online, but nothing could be farther from the truth,' said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington D.C. 'The 'digital exhaust' we leave in our wakes as we do things online is prodigious and highly identifying.'Hall said that in the U.S. context there are 'John Doe' lawsuits that seek to unmask anonymous user accounts, but these lawsuits are usually directed at Internet Service Providers.The lawsuit against HerdSceneAnd has parallels to a case involving Diet Madison, an Instagram account that publicized allegations of sexual harassment in the U.S. advertising industry. In the Diet Madison case, which is still underway in a Los Angeles courtroom, the judge has limited[17] the information that can be asked for. In the India case, however, the courts have directly asked Facebook for user information.Were Facebook to hand over user data, Hall said, 'it would mean that Instagram users would need to be very careful making whistleblower-like or even critical comments about people in positions of power, lest the powerful people sue and have an easy way to chill speech on Instagram.' Encryption Versus Enforcement India's wholehearted embrace of Facebook's social media platforms, coupled with the Indian government's draconian position on free speech and growing obsession with surveillance, has given the country significant leverage in the ongoing debate pitting encryption technologies against law enforcement companies. What happens in India could affect how users around the world experience these services.The Indian government has long argued that WhatsApp's encrypted messaging service is detrimental to national security and has demanded WhatsApp 'digitally fingerprint' all messages in India. Facebook has pushed back thus far, arguing it would undermine user privacy and turn WhatsApp into a different product. Yet with over 400 million WhatsApp users[18] in India, it is unclear how long Facebook will hold out.Across the world, pressure on Facebook is growing. On Oct. 4, 2019,U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel and U.S. Attorney General William Barrsigned an open letter to Facebook[19] asking for the company to re-think its stance on encrypting user communications. The letter was released alongside the signing of new agreement, called the Cloud Act[20], meant to remove obstacles to cross-border surveillance between the U.S. and U.K.Meanwhile, the Indian Supreme Court is hearing a petition asking that all Indian social media accounts be linked to a national ID[21]. This emerged from the question of WhatsApp traceability, and Facebook has made itself a party to this petition and is arguing against such a requirement. This latest defamation case feeds into the Indian government's narrative that social media must be regulated for the public good.Yet in this case, this so-called public good is likely to privilege a powerful, wealthy male artist against a small band of women who say he preyed on them.'I would hope Facebook would push back strongly against efforts to identify people in these cases where there isn't a valid public interest in disclosure,' Hall from CDT said. 'I suspect in this case the person that owns and operates the accounts is merely serving as a conduit, so I doubt identifying the owner of the account will identify the person making the statements.'This feels like an effort to intimidate the owner of the account into silence.'

The billions who use their services for making social media posts, uploading videos or searching ads are targeted by the tech companies for their personal data \u2014 a prized asset that enhances the companies\u2019 power. Regulators are examining whether the companies have used their market power to crimp competition, potentially raising prices and hurting consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Dissatisfaction with what federal authorities have done so far may be pushing some states to band together to run their own investigations, possibly eyeing more aggressive sanctions. The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s recent $5 billion fine against Facebook over privacy violations, for example, was criticized by consumer advocates and a number of public officials as being too lenient.</p><p> \u201cThe states see it as part of their role to fill a vacuum,\u201d said Jay Himes, an antitrust lawyer in New York. Himes, a former head of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general\u2019s office, worked on the states\u2019 antitrust case against Microsoft about 20 years ago.</p><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James said Friday her probe will look into Facebook\u2019s dominance and any resulting anticompetitive conduct.</p><p> A separate group of state attorneys general is announcing Monday in Washington the launch of an investigation into \u201cwhether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access and harmed consumers,\u201d an advisory from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Friday. The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, citing sources they didn\u2019t identify, have reported that target will be Google.</p><p> Both groups of state attorneys general include Democrats and Republicans. Joining James, a Democrat, in the Facebook investigation are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.</p><p> With some 2.4 billion users around the globe and a huge social media presence, Facebook has sparked outrage with a series of privacy scandals and its use by Russian operatives in the 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p> \u201cEven the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,\u201d James said.</p><p> Critics worry that Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer. That ultimately could reduce viable alternatives for consumers looking, for instance, for comparable services that do less tracking for targeted advertising. Businesses, including mom and pop shops, might have to pay more for ads if they have fewer choices to reach consumers online.</p><p> The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p> The lawmaker leading that investigation, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said Friday the states\u2019 probe of Facebook is \u201ccompletely appropriate.\u201d</p><p> \u201cFacebook has proven time and time again that it cannot be trusted to regulate itself,\u201d Cicilline said.</p><p> The states have the power to make big changes to the tech industry \u2014 especially if enough of them band together, said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a group that advocates for the breakup of corporate monopolies. Though states have limited jurisdictions, he said, once a few of the bigger states get involved, changes can come that can affect most of the country.</p><p> \u201cYou really have to break their power, and I think the states are more likely to do that than anyone else,\u201d Stoller said in an interview.</p><p>Facebook said it plans to \u201cwork constructively\u201d with the state attorneys general and welcomes a conversation with policymakers about competition.</p><p> \u201cPeople have multiple choices for every one of the services we provide,\u201d said Will Castleberry, a vice president of state and local policy. \u201cWe understand that if we stop innovating, people can easily leave our platform. This underscores the competition we face, not only in the U.S. but around the globe.\u201d</p><p>Google issued a statement that didn\u2019t comment directly on the antitrust concerns but said its services \u201chelp people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country.\u201d</p><p> \u201cWe continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,\u201d Google\u2019s statement said.</p><p> Big Tech won\u2019t be an easy target. Current interpretations of U.S. law against monopolies don\u2019t obviously apply to companies offering inexpensive goods or free online services.</p><p> Traditional antitrust law focuses on dominant businesses that harm consumers, typically through practices that raise prices for consumers. But many tech companies offer free products that are paid for by a largely invisible trade in the personal data gleaned from those services. Others like Amazon offer consistently low prices on a wide array of merchandise.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONTCH-4422665</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E0FF8CAB62B7C MONTCH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0J-2XD1-JBCN-43PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Monterey County Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Monterey County Herald (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 7, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I am Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, today, we are departing from our usual heap of politicians screaming at each other to remember a man who never screamed at all, and now has left this world for good. Ross Perot is dead. He was 89 years old.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, some younger folks out there might not know him, remember him, but older Americans won't soon forget him. A man who led his charge do the talking, as much as his stunning quest for the presidency of the United States left all the experts fumbling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not just that they underestimated him. They underestimated the power of what he was telling us, all of us, and how our government had failed us, a rage so palpable, some say it festered still in the populist wave that would later bring us Donald Trump.</p><p>Ross Perot, a man who made billions in life, worried about the billions more this government was wasting en route to what he warned would be its fiscal death, if we didn't wake up, if we didn't see the bipartisan madness of its ways, spending more than we were taking in year in and year out.</p><p>And he was on it. Armed with a little more than charts on a stand and a matching chip on his shoulder, Ross Perot figured, if he didn't say something, no one would do anything. So, back in 1992, Perot took on the established parties to say, both Democrats and Republicans had failed this country.</p><p>Who does that remind you of, by the way?</p><p>And he was going save it, run for president of the United States to get the attention of everyone in the United States. They said he was wasting his time, that no one would want to listen to lectures on budgets that really didn't seem to matter, too depressing, too boring, too much.</p><p>But the political experts underestimated American voters as much as they did Ross Perot himself, this third-party candidate who took on an incumbent Republican president who had triumphed in Kuwait, and a rising Democratic star named Bill Clinton, who had electrified crowds, managed to upend politics, for a while an entire presidential race.</p><p>In fact, before he abruptly quit that race himself, for a short time, Ross Perot was leading those established candidates. And when he reentered, he still managed what no third-party candidate had ever done before or since, garner a stunning 19 percent of the vote.</p><p>His message was as simple as it was certainly unconventional and, well, politically suicidal. His goal? Be frank, be jarring, be real. But he spelled it all out on paper, a spending bill and a binge that was unsustainable.</p><p>Leave it to Bill Clinton to heed his warnings and start hacking that spending years later. But the seeds were planted with Ross Perot that election year, and hopefully a reminder to politicians now you can level and should level with the American people this year, all years.</p><p>And years after that historic run, it was a message he repeated as a CEO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS PEROT SR., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our people are doing a fantastic job for their customers and are going to be doing a fantastic job for their shareholders, because they are shareholders also.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, do I read into this, Mr. Perot, that Ross Perot, the successful business titan, is back, and maybe hanging up his political cap, or no?</p><p>ROSS PEROT SR.: Well, the one thing I can tell you definitely is, building a company is a lot more fun than being around politics, because it's based on results and performance.</p><p>Politics is magic acts, illusions, spin, and manipulation. So it's a lot more fun to do this all day, every day. I'll tell you that.</p><p>CAVUTO: So is that your way of saying you're not entertaining another presidential run?</p><p>ROSS PEROT SR.: I'm very...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSS PEROT SR.: ... at making sure that I live up to all of our commitments to our customers, the people in our company, and the stockholders.</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of those customers and indeed a lot of Americans in general would like to see Ross Perot run again. Do you at all entertain it?</p><p>ROSS PEROT SR.: Well, let -- I'm talking about business today. And I'm totally focused on making sure this company reaches its full potential.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so don't concentrate on what I was wearing.</p><p>What was I thinking?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Concentrate on what he was saying. It was very powerful, a man who single-handedly changed the definition of politics by not acting like a politician at all, who proved you could level with the American people, as I said, if you show a way out for the American people.</p><p>Ross Perot did that. Today, we remember that. We lead with that, which is why we're all over that with his son, Ross Perot Jr., on his dad's quest to keep the nation's debt from blowing up, and his handpicked Svengali, you might say, the former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, who launched a national campaign to make the importance of spending only what you have sink in.</p><p>Then there's poster Tom Bevan on how Perot darn near sent the two-party system as we know it tumbling down.</p><p>We begin, though, with the man named Russ who made a household word out of Ross, Russ Verney, who single-handedly -- he will never say that -- helped make Ross Perot make history.</p><p>Russ, an honor to have you. Thank you for coming.</p><p>RUSSELL VERNEY, FORMER ROSS PEROT CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Neil, it's an honor to be on.</p><p>And on behalf of the entire political team for Ross, we'd like to express our condolences to Margot Perot, the Perot family, and all of his friends. We -- America lost a giant of a man today. But he's got a tremendous legacy for all of us to enjoy forever.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I share that and offer that to you as well, Russ.</p><p>And people forget what 1992 was like, what you guys managed to pull off then. It a historic third-party run, the likes of which we hadn't seen before and certainly since.</p><p>What made it click, do you think?</p><p>VERNEY: I think what made it click was Ross' ability to communicate with the average person. He didn't use technical terms. He didn't use bureaucratic terms. He used everyday, plain-speaking talk, something that you learn in Texarkana, Texas.</p><p>And he used 30-minute infomercials. He didn't use 30-second attack ads to go after any of his opponents. He used 30-minute infomercials to educate the American public. And it worked people. Tuned in. People loved it. He gave them facts. And he gave them a little humor along with it.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, I can remember talking to him a number of times, Russ. And I would talk about the fact, well, what's so bad about the debt?</p><p>When you think about it, the Chinese and others will always be buying it? He says, well, there's a difference between investing and owning. And we're getting to the point, he said, and that was years ago, where they own us.</p><p>VERNEY: Back then, we were at a $4 trillion debt. Now we're up to 21 trillion.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow.</p><p>VERNEY: And we have to pay interest on that.</p><p>So if people want to provide financing for any government program, just look at the interest we're wasting on our national debt. It doesn't buy a minute of education, a mile of highway, or a soldier to defend this country.</p><p>Wasted money.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, he was also the first to call into question consensus views on not only debt, but the shrugging that you got out of both parties, but even when it came to NAFTA, the original Mexican-Canadian trade deal.</p><p>And he had serious doubts about that, doubts that this president shared today, so much so that he forged a new agreement that he thinks will be fairer to American workers. What do you think of that part of his legacy?</p><p>VERNEY: Well, I think there's lots of parts of his legacy. And that certainly is one of the important ones, that we should be looking to base - - base our trade policies on strength and not on favors.</p><p>NAFTA was all about building an extrajudicial system in Mexico to protect investors against government takeover of their properties down there. It wasn't about fair trade. It was very managed trade, with multiple volumes of books explaining it.</p><p>So Ross was able to take a lot of these complicated issues and explain them to people. He went on into health care, many other subjects over the life of his -- his political activity.</p><p>CAVUTO: You're very modest yourself, Russell. You had a lot to do with that.</p><p>But let me ask you a question that's always out there. Had he not quit the race briefly in '92, when he was leading Bill Clinton and George Bush Sr., do you think he would have gone all the way?</p><p>VERNEY: Well, I think there's a lot of speculation about that. I certainly think he would have.</p><p>But, in reality, Neil, the exit polling that was paid for by the news media on Election Day, when people reported to them that they voted for Clinton or Bush, they were asked a follow-up question. If you thought Ross Perot could -- could win, would you have voted for him?</p><p>This is after he get out and got back in. And the analysis of that question is, Ross Perot could have won if people thought he could win. So, yes, I think if he had stayed in, he could have won.</p><p>But he has had a great impact on all of American life through his philanthropy, through his dedication, devotion to his family and especially to his commitment to politics, because it's all about service, and not about self.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>VERNEY: He was never looking to get anything. It was always about giving.</p><p>CAVUTO: You're exactly right. And you helped make that possible.</p><p>Russ, thank you for helping bring us Ross and bring him tantalizingly close to the White House. Very good seeing you, my friend.</p><p>VERNEY: Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of people focus on Ross Perot's third-party run.</p><p>His son told me during the 2012 campaign more people should focus on his fight just against runaway spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS PEROT JR., SON OF ROSS PEROT: My father's very focused on the debt, as you said. And my father is a great visionary. He was early on this subject.</p><p>I wish we could have fixed it 20 years ago. Had a $4 trillion problem. It's now a $16 trillion problem. We have to fix it now.</p><p>Let's go to work and build this country, pay that debt off and have a great future for our children. That's what my father wants. And that's the game plan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: To the man who was, well, a lot of people say, a Perot apostle, a former comptroller. I'm talking about David Walker, who worked very closely with Ross Perot on fiscal issues, also felt that passion, and to this day has been bemoaning what neither party seems to get still, that you can't keep spending more than you're taking in.</p><p>David, good to have you.</p><p>That is the gist of the Perot legacy, isn't it?</p><p>DAVID WALKER, COMEBACK AMERICA INITIATIVE: It is.</p><p>Ross Perot was a unique individual. And the one word that comes to me when I think of Ross Perot is patriot. He's one of the best patriots his country's ever had. He was successful in business. He truly cared about stewardship.</p><p>He was a great family man. I remember seeing all the bronze of all of his grandkids as you entered into his office. But he made a big difference. He didn't win that race. But he made fiscal responsibility a top priority for Bill Clinton.</p><p>Even his Cabinet secretaries will admit that publicly. He also helped to contribute to the Contract for America. And the combination of those two things led us to surpluses for four years.</p><p>But now we're totally out of control. And we need a Perot constitutional amendment that will put a cap of debt to GDP that cannot be violated. That's what we need, because Washington's out of touch and out of control. Ross got it right. Let's honor him.</p><p>CAVUTO: He had said, as you often said, I would rather lose saying the right things than just saying anything.</p><p>And that was his message, wasn't it?</p><p>WALKER: My personal view is, is, I'm not sure if Ross wanted to win or not.</p><p>But what he did want to do is, he wanted to tell the American people the truth, he wanted to wake up America. And he wanted to try to help set the agenda for the president and the Congress. And guess what? He did.</p><p>CAVUTO: He did.</p><p>WALKER: And he will always be remembered for that.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, when you think about it too, David, he broke all the rules, right?</p><p>That was an odd campaign delivered by this oddest of billionaires, who said, look, if you don't see what's happening, we're all going to be paying dearly for this. And it resonated.</p><p>WALKER: And what he knew is that the American people can handle the truth.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>WALKER: They're willing to accept tough choices, if they're part of a comprehensive, principle-based plan that people think are fair.</p><p>And that's what the president has to do. The president has to lead that effort, because, the longer we wait, the more difficult the choices, the higher the risk, and the less burden we're putting on our children and grandchildren.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well put. Well put, David.</p><p>WALKER: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Very well put.</p><p>David Walker.</p><p>And I think David just touched on it here, and a good intro for my next guest here, that the American people should be treated like adults. You should be treated like an adult. No one needs to talk down to you or feel afraid of offending you, if they just level with you, if they say that what's going on cannot be sustained, that something's got to be done.</p><p>That is the real legacy of Ross Perot here, that this reality in Washington that just keeps pouring more money in and in and in and getting less and less out couldn't sustain itself, even now.</p><p>RealClearPolitics' Tom Bevan on that part of the legacy.</p><p>Tom, what do you think?</p><p>TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE EDITOR, REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM: Yes, I think you're right, Neil.</p><p>I mean, the one thing about Ross Perot, he was a unique character in American politics, and he was authentic. I mean, this is -- you mentioned that there was this populist strain which sort of was the precursor to where we ended up with Donald Trump.</p><p>You remember, 1982 was the year Pat Buchanan challenged George H.W. Bush. So, there was populism out there.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: The pitchfork campaign, I remember it well.</p><p>BEVAN: That -- pitchfork Pat, exactly.</p><p>And Ross Perot really harnessed that. He harnessed a lot of disaffected voters around the country. And he did it in a way that really surprised a lot of folks. I mean, he was able to get on the ballot in all 50 states. That is not an easy task.</p><p>I mean, he did spend some $60 million of his own money, and he had the money to spend. But the thing that we learned about Ross Perot is that he was authentic, and he was able to explain these subjects to voters and communicate with them in a way not dissimilar to Donald Trump, in a way that experts didn't see coming.</p><p>And he really was a leader for that time. And, again, had he not gotten out of the race, we don't know what would have happened, but certainly the results, 19 million votes that year in 1992. And for a while, he was leading. He had the establishment on both sides up in arms.</p><p>CAVUTO: He was.</p><p>All right, Tom Bevan, thank you very much of RealClearPolitics here.</p><p>I want you to think of that legacy and getting 19 percent of the vote, a little more than a few days after we lost Lee Iacocca, two legends, if you think about it, who defined greatness and bravery under enormous pressure.</p><p>Whatever your politics, you cannot deny the wisdom of what both men offered, in Ross Perot' case, a stark reminder that the two parties had failed when it came to doing their essential job, handling the books.</p><p>He did it with charts, against every piece of logic and campaign experts, who said, too boring, too vapid, too silly, and the guy delivering it too weird.</p><p>They were wrong.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we're just seeing former Vice President Joe Biden's tax returns from the last couple of years.</p><p>Keep it in mind, this covers the period he is a private citizen, leaving the White House and the vice president's mansion. And he's done OK for himself.</p><p>He and his wife, Jill, have made more than $15 million since he left office. He made a lot of money, so much money, it dwarfs any of the opponents including who up until now was the number one moneymaker among the presidential candidates, Kamala Harris of California, who, with her husband, made a little bit more than $2 million.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, though, however you view this, that if you count the years he was vice president and released tax returns every year and all the years before that he was senator, they have more than two decades of returns that Joe Biden has released for all the world to see.</p><p>And I have been -- been going year by year, and they're all there. It's a reminder, no doubt, the Biden campaign is sending to the United States that he has not done the same.</p><p>How big a deal is that?</p><p>Let's ask the Judge Andrew Napolitano, whose own tax return resembles the yellow pages of the Manhattan phone book.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Good to see you, my friend.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS JUDICIAL ANALYST: God love you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, here we go. Here we go.</p><p>And no mystery that, as a private citizen, he made a lot of money.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm sure the Obamas have done quite well. Most former presidents and vice presidents go back in the shtick and do well.</p><p>But that's a lot of years of returns.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It is.</p><p>I think it probably, if he's the nominee, would put some pressure on President Trump. The president's in an odd situation here, because the legislature of the state of New York enacted legislation which Governor Cuomo signed just the other day which targets Donald Trump, the taxpayer.</p><p>It doesn't name him by name, but it targets him. And the federal courts look very, very, very skeptically at legislation that was written just to target one taxpayer. So even though this legislation basically says to the Congress, do you want Donald Trump the private citizen's state tax returns, from which you can extrapolate what he reported to the feds? Come and get them.</p><p>I think that legislation is unconstitutional. I think the president wins on that. But, politically, Joe Biden has revealed so much today, it's mind-boggling.</p><p>CAVUTO: It is mind-boggling.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The amount of taxes that he paid is so impressive. The amount of charity is so generous.</p><p>This, I think, will put a lot of heat under the president's feet if Biden is the Democratic nominee.</p><p>CAVUTO: And it kind of puts Republicans in a corner here. You can't start picking apart his tax return, if the guy who is heading your ticket is not releasing his. And that's not a political statement, one or the other, but it would kind of neuter that argument.</p><p>But I am wondering. This is another reminder all the candidates have promised to do this going back to, I guess, when they first started working.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: But how important is it, do you think? Is there a requirement that it be done? It's procedure.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, I think that -- and I say this respectfully -- President Trump has made it important, because the selling point for him in 2016 was, he was a brilliant, successful businessman who accomplished so much, and he would use those same skills in the White House.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But he wasn't able to back that up with the tax return. So it might be a little less important. He's going to run as a different person in 2020 than he did in 2016.</p><p>But it's because of his personality, his persona and his background that his tax returns, so many people in both parties feel they should be able to see them.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Can the Congress get their hands on them? He's also confronted with that.</p><p>I honestly didn't know that statute existed. But the statute says the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, not the president, not the speaker of the House, but the chair of that committee, can get anybody's tax returns.</p><p>Steve Mnuchin won't surrender them. And he has the president's tax returns in his desk drawer.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow.</p><p>I wonder if he does? Like, wow, he did OK there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Judge, thank you very, very much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You're welcome.</p><p>CAVUTO: Andrew Napolitano, who, by the way, has Justin Amash on FBN later tonight, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm filling in for -- I'm attempting to fill in for our colleague Kennedy.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is a big deal.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And Justin Amash, who says the president...</p><p>CAVUTO: Looking forward to that tonight.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Thank you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): This is about keeping -- you know, make America -- you know, his hat? Make America white again. They want to make sure that people, certain people, are counted.</p><p>It's really disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Is it me, or does everything comes down to racism?</p><p>Anyway, the House speaker summing up the Trump administration's approach to the citizenship question on the census, that it's racist, that it's motivated by wanting to advance the white population in this country, and the hell with everyone else.</p><p>GOP strategist Joseph Pinion with us, The Wall Street Journal's Bill McGurn, political science Iona politics rMD-BO_rMD-BO_Professor Jeanne Zaino.</p><p>rMD-BO_rMD-BO_Jeanne Zaino, the racist argument aside, which I think just - - I don't know where you go with that. But this issue of the question and forcing it back on, and then Bill Barr, the attorney general, saying there is a way to get it back in there, the failure on the part of administration was to adequately make the case for having it put back in there, right?</p><p>Where do you think it goes?</p><p>rMD-BO_JEANNE ZAINO, IONA COLLEGE: Yes, the failure was their explanation as to why they needed it in the first place.</p><p>And Chief Justice Roberts was right. You can't have administrative agencies acting without making a case as to why they're doing it. So that was the flaw.</p><p>I believe the minute they're able to answer that -- and we're hearing how they're going to answer that -- the minute they answer that, this will be on there, because Chief Justice Roberts, if it even got back to the court, which I doubt, the Supreme Court would flip to the five.</p><p>So this is a question that was there in the past. Going up to 1950, it was there. But I think a big question is, do you get a better count with it or...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No made a big investigation when the question was taken away.</p><p>ZAINO: No. No.</p><p>CAVUTO: But if I understand correctly, Joe, it is a question included in virtually every major Western power's census, although they don't call it such, but they all have variations of this.</p><p>And they all ask the question in Germany and Britain and Ireland and Italy and in a lot of South American countries. It's just standard fare.</p><p>JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yes.</p><p>I think we're looking at, there's the commonsense answer that appeals to most Americans, which is, why wouldn't we want to know how many people are here, period, and then also how many people are American citizens and how many are not, just to have an accurate reflection?</p><p>I think that resonates with a broad swathe of Americans. I think, to rMD- BO_rMD-BO_Jeanne's point, that the broader issue is, again, the implementation. How do you -- how do you end up time after time trying to basically jump the shark on the political angle, where you have these political advisers making arguments that are maybe right on paper, or at least right in principle, for the American people, but also not right in the application from the legal aspect as far as, how do you make it get implemented?</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>So when you're looking at all of this, Bill, where does it go? I mean, do you think, in the end, this question will be included on the census, or is it almost too late?</p><p>BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think they're looking for ways.</p><p>Look, I go back. I think this is really an outrage by John Roberts, because he basically said, they gave a reason, but he didn't accept the reason, even though what they did was lawful. That opens the door to a lot of second-guessing and a lot lawsuits on things.</p><p>I think, to Joe's point, I believe I saw a Harvard poll today on the census. And it's something like two-thirds of Americans are in favor of the question. And that includes a majority of Hispanics and a majority of Democrats, slight majorities, but still a majority.</p><p>I'm not sure this is the issue people want to die on, because I think a lot of people take the commonsense point of view.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGURN: And, look, the race argument, that's what you say when you don't have an argument.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, they argue that there was sort of a sinister motive to it, right?</p><p>PINION: Look, I think this notion, make America white again, I mean, that's probably the stupidest thing Nancy Pelosi has ever said, which is saying a lot for Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PINION: So I think, realistically, you have talk to most Americans, yes, maybe there might be some hesitation amongst people in communities that are minorities to answer these questions, as there always has been.</p><p>But if you take a deeper look, I mean, we're really talking about politics. You are talking about the fact that where are these people that mostly are undocumented live? You're talking about California, you're talking about New York, but you're also talking about Texas, you're also talking about Florida.</p><p>So this notion that it's going to adversely impact minorities and, by extension, Democrats, to me is a bunch of bunk, because, realistically, you could actually make the argument that President Trump is shooting himself in the foot and shooting the party in the foot, because if the influence of Texas is diminished, if the influence of Florida is diminished, you're going to see a lot of GOP power in D.C. diminish as a result of that.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's a great point. That's a very good point.</p><p>PINION: So I think that that, to me, is the argument that should be being made, is that this is not about politics in the way that they want to make it about politics.</p><p>This is simply about being able to say, do we have 10 million people who are undocumented or do we have 20 many people who are undocumented? Because that is not only just an imperative for us know how do we serve our community?</p><p>CAVUTO: Fair enough.</p><p>PINION: It's also a matter of saying, from a national security standpoint, as we start going into a 21st century world, how do we take care of the number one obligation we have to our people, which is to make sure our people are safe?</p><p>CAVUTO: And that's what this is all about. That's what this is all about.</p><p>If you guys don't mind -- and, rMD-BO_rMD-BO_Jeanne, I will go to you on this -- tax returns are out for Joe Biden. He's done very well since leaving the White House. He and his wife have made $15 million. Touche for them. Capitalist society, all that.</p><p>But now, between what he's released post leaving government and all the returns he's made public while he was in government, that's decades of returns. Now, does that move the needle on the president sharing his?</p><p>ZAINO: You know, I think if the president's needle wasn't moved in 2016, and it hasn't been moved since, I don't think Joe Biden's release -- and Joe Biden, he's been in public office for so long.</p><p>We have seen him. He's been vetted so many times. I don't think -- he's been out of office, certainly, for a few years, but I don't think we're going to see an awful huge impact from this, unless there's something that I don't know in those tax returns.</p><p>And, obviously, we haven't had a chance to look at them yet.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, we haven't.</p><p>But I'm wondering if it puts pressure on the president, or all these efforts to force him, you know?</p><p>MCGURN: Yes, I agree.</p><p>I think the voters made that choice when they voted for the president and he didn't put it out. I do think it puts pressure on maybe some of the other Democrats that are running against him, ironically.</p><p>But I don't think the president's going to feel the pressure, especially because I am not sure the Biden campaign is on the ascendancy at the moment.</p><p>CAVUTO: And being a rich candidate, the richest candidate, might...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PINION: Yes, I think he's -- the president has everything to lose and nothing to gain.</p><p>The reality is that, again, people who voted for him before voted for him in spite of not knowing. And I think, again, if he's going to get reelected, that's not going to be the issue.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we got all your tax returns.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: ... right after this. They're staggering, really. These guys are all doing quite well.</p><p>All right, she very -- she came really close to taking a Republican House seat in Kentucky last go-round. Now she is setting her sights on Mitch McConnell. And people are paying attention and giving a lot of money.</p><p>The woman who wants to make sure Mitch McConnell becomes the former senator from Kentucky -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: She is taking on the most powerful person in the United States Senate, retired fighter pilot and Democrat Amy McGrath, who says Mitch McConnell should be made history, and she is just the one to do it.</p><p>She's here in 60 seconds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): It'll be a spirited race, particularly since I have become leader of my party in the Senate. I have noticed I get more attention than I used to.</p><p>And I look forward to the contest and laying out our differences to the people of Kentucky.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: She's a great candidate. She's a great American. She realizes Mitch McConnell will throw everything but the kitchen sink at her. But her sense of duty and honor to Kentucky and America prevailed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, they're talking about retired Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, already making waves after jumping into the Kentucky Senate race.</p><p>She is hoping to unseat the Kentucky Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, taking aim at some of his signature legislation earlier, when she was with me on FOX Business Network.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: On the tax cuts that Mitch McConnell championed, would you work to remove them?</p><p>rMDNM_AMY MCGRATH (D), KENTUCKY SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think it's important to note that the only major piece of legislation that Senator McConnell was able to do when he had all the power was this tax windfall for corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent.</p><p>And the problem that I had with the tax cuts was not that I'm for tax cuts -- or against tax cuts for the middle class. I'm not.</p><p>I didn't marry a millionaire. I married a Navy man. So, everybody wants low taxes.</p><p>The problem that I had was his priority was always corporations. If you -- your priority should have been the people of Kentucky, and he should have made the middle-class tax cuts permanent. And he didn't do that.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. But, again, to be fair -- and, again, you can argue the size and scope of the tax cuts, but about 80 percent of Americans did get them.</p><p>And I don't know how that percentage breaks down in Kentucky. But would you tell residents of Kentucky, I'm going to scrap all of those and start fresh?</p><p>MCGRATH: No, I wouldn't tell them I would I would scrap them all. I would fix it.</p><p>CAVUTO: How so?</p><p>MCGRATH: I would give tax cuts to the middle class. I would give -- I would give tax cuts to the middle class and working class in particular.</p><p>I think that's really important. And that's where I would start.</p><p>CAVUTO: And take away the ones for the rich and the corporate tax cut that was cut to 21 percent? You would shelve that?</p><p>MCGRATH: I think that's something we should look at.</p><p>I mean, look, those tax cuts that Mitch McConnell championed, you have to remember they almost doubled our deficit. They increased our debt by $2 trillion. I don't think that's very responsible.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you're new to this. You're new to politics. And I commend you for saying that.</p><p>But Democrats had a hand in increasing the debt before this president, and the Republican president before that president, and the Democratic president before that president. The debt has exponentially gone way out of control.</p><p>Would you make it a central part of your duty, if you become a United States senator, to address the debt?</p><p>MCGRATH: I think we absolutely have to address the debt. It's something that's very important to me.</p><p>I am also very concerned about it. Guys like Mitch McConnell and -- Senator McConnell have said that they are concerned about the debt. And then, when they get in power, what do they do? They increase it.</p><p>I think it's a problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, they all do that, right? Democrats, Republicans alike, they all do that. So how would you stop it?</p><p>MCGRATH: Well, I think you stop it by getting people elected who are honest with the American people about our debt.</p><p>And we have to pay for that the goods and services we want government to provide. I think that's very important.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. But Barack Obama was sincere, I take it at face value, in trying to deal with the debt. He couldn't deal with it, George Bush before him equally sincere, and no one seems to get a handle on it.</p><p>Is it so important to you that you might scale back some spending to deal with it?</p><p>MCGRATH: Well, I will tell you this, that we were on a path to decrease our deficit in the last few years of the last administration, and we were on that path.</p><p>And then Senator Mitch McConnell came in with these -- this tax windfall, and we now almost doubled it. So that's not the right thing to do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I don't know if we were on a path. We were certainly in the years of Bill Clinton. You're quite right about that. I don't know if we were on a path there.</p><p>But you would go ahead and address entitlements as well to deal with that, as you're cutting tax cuts that were in trail now?</p><p>MCGRATH: I think what we need to do is get people in office who want to look at a range of things and come together as Republicans and Democrats and look at our debt and how we address it.</p><p>I think that we started to try to do that with things like the Bowles- Simpson plan and the Rivlin-Domenici plan.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCGRATH: And that was thrown away. Why was it thrown away? Because we had people that just didn't -- didn't want to go to that.</p><p>We had the Tea Party, for example, that went -- that held up our national debt and said that they were going to basically hold it hostage.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I mean, it wasn't just the Tea Party. I mean, everyone had a hand in this.</p><p>I guess what I'm asking you -- and, also, as someone who has served in the military in this country very honorably, would you be open to paring defense spending?</p><p>MCGRATH: You know, I'm -- here's what I would say about defense.</p><p>As somebody who's served in three combat tours, as a Marine, I don't think we can pare defense spending until we stop the wars that we're in.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>MCGRATH: It's very important to me to make sure that we have body armor for our Marines going forward.</p><p>And so I don't think we can think about that right now until we scale back. And that's why I'm for things like an authorization to use military force. That's why that's such a big, important thing for me.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, we want to let you know we did put out a call to Mitch McConnell's office, fair and balanced, to get him on. They are working on it. All right.</p><p>In the meantime, the Democrats' fight for a $15 minimum wage. A government study has said that 17 million Americans would get a raise, but a little bit more than a million would lose their jobs.</p><p>CAVUTO: The Congressional Budget Office has a report out that says a $15 minimum wage would boost pay for about 17 million folks in this country. That's the good thing.</p><p>Now the bad thing. It would eliminate more than 1.3 million jobs in the process. So is it worth that tradeoff?</p><p>The host of FOX Business Network's \"The Evening Edit,\" great show, great host, Elizabeth -- wicked smart -- MacDonald.</p><p>So, Faustian choice here.</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that is the choice.</p><p>And the 1.7 million job losses, that was the average. They were saying upwards, I think, of 3.7 million losses. That could be the upper band. This is CBO saying it.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is the CBO saying it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: The idea that you boost it, someone's going to have to go.</p><p>MACDONALD: Low-skilled workers would have to go, the very people who would benefit from the higher wages.</p><p>Listen, we want to get higher pay for workers, absolutely, across the country. But it's -- but how do you do it? Should the government top down do it? That's the debate right, Neil?</p><p>Because we know that Bernie Sanders loves the Nordic countries, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, Norway. They do not have a minimum wage. They leave it up to the private sector to work it out in collective bargaining with unions.</p><p>CAVUTO: But don't a lot of states now, a good many, more than half, have higher minimum wages, some as or getting in the direction of $15 anyway?</p><p>But the markets ultimately would decide this, right? You and I know of towns where jobs go begging at $15, and the Wendy's and all these legendary stories, where they can't get those jobs filled.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's the point.</p><p>And also your point is well taken about the states doing it, because the cost of living is different in each state, certainly lower in the Midwest vs. New York or California.</p><p>So is that the one size fits all federal minimum wage? Or should you just leave it to the states? We know that, for example, China has a mandated minimum wage, and they pay, what, $1 an hour?</p><p>So it's about whether the government should mandate it or the private sector. And we talked recently about Amazon lifting its minimum wage to $15 an hour. People say, ooh, that was the moral thing to do. Amazon was morally right to do that.</p><p>What did Amazon do? They cut stock compensation. They cut bonuses. They cut worker jobs and had 100,000 robots instead.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, you give it in one area, take it away in another.</p><p>But the Armageddon that a lot of folks feared with this coming was, it didn't materialize, right? For a lot of people -- we're looking to deal with record unemployment lows here in some of these states and all where wages did go up. But that's a booming economy, right?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's -- so that's the issue. Can a booming economy just lift more boats than having the government step in and saying, yes, lift the wages?</p><p>Again and again, we say, yes, what is the best way to get wages on the rise? We know they're up under the Trump administration. Like, I don't know if the top-down approach works. I mean, I'm just looking at all the data here. And we see that with the minimum wage, more than half leave that low-wage job within a year, and they go up the income ladder.</p><p>So it's not that they're locked on that minimum wage job. There's a lot a mobility up and out. It's usually college age students who have the minimum wage job.</p><p>It's a terrible that we're in this country where people are trying to raise a family on the minimum wage. That's not how this economy is supposed to be working.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. If the economy itself is sound, invariably, the minimum wage goes up anyway.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's right.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right? We will see.</p><p>All right, looking forward to see you tonight, young lady, Lizzie wicked MacDonald and \"The Evening Edit,\" the final stamp on all these things.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, the Green New Deal really didn't get very, very far. Now Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is teaming up with Senator Bernie Sanders to declare a climate emergency.</p><p>They're saying their own party leadership isn't paying attention, so they will, which means you better pay attention, or, well, you won't believe what happens.</p><p>CAVUTO: Keen to be green.</p><p>Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Bernie Sanders teaming up to introduce a resolution declaring climate change is an emergency after the Green New Deal failed to take off.</p><p>Peter Doocy in Washington with more on that.</p><p>Hey, Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, because Congress never agreed to a Green New Deal, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are among the lawmakers now pitching a climate emergency with a brand-new nonbinding resolution that says in part this:</p><p>\"The climate crisis severely and urgently impacts the economic and social well-being, health and safety and national security of the United States. The time is now for Congress to declare a climate emergency and swiftly mobilize federal resources in response to protect the interests of our nation and its people.\"</p><p>And Ocasio-Cortez continued pitching the climate emergency on a conference call just now.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): This right here is the first step in declaring a climate emergency, is frankly (AUDIO GAP) the actual scientific facts.</p><p>And it's part of the basic step of what we must do in order to start pursuing the plan that we need.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: There's a lot of text about how bad global warming has gotten and the need to address it.</p><p>But there is not a lot of new text about specifically how these Democratic lawmakers would do that. And believe it or not, these Democrats claim they are trying to take a page from the Trump playbook.</p><p>Congressman Earl Blumenauer says, when President Trump declared a national emergency at the border, they decided they could declare a national emergency for the planet. And expect to hear a lot more of this on the campaign trail, because Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, who is involved with this as well, called climate change an existential threat today -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Peter, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Well, what would you call a social media summit without Facebook? Kind of like a media journalism powwow without inviting Howard Kurtz. Well, we have got Howard Kurtz.</p><p>Now, what the heck is going on with Facebook?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, well the White House is planning this social media summit later this week.</p><p>One platform that has faced its share of challenges, Facebook, well, they're apparently saying, we were not invited. That's weird.</p><p>\"Media Buzz\" host Howard Kurtz not weird, but a good read of things that are little unusual.</p><p>What do you make of that, if that's true?</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's a Facebook bashing summit.</p><p>It's no accident. The president's been on a tear against all these social media companies, Facebook, Google, and especially lately Twitter, who he is accusing of making it harder for people to follow him. He's got 60 million followers.</p><p>Sometimes, they reduce everybody's count because they're trying knock out the bots and the fake accounts and so forth.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: But I think that a number of prominent conservatives and conservative groups have been invited to this summit. We're going to see a lot of complaints against these big tech companies.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, now, he's been arguing they're all in a cabal against him, they don't treat it fairly, and the news they push, if it's especially is critical, is fake.</p><p>But Facebook not even being there would rob him of a chance to tell them to their face.</p><p>KURTZ: It's be much better television showdown, Zuck vs. Trump, but that's not going to happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: Look...</p><p>CAVUTO: The CEOs are coming? It's the CEOs coming to this, not just their underlings?</p><p>KURTZ: I'm not positive about that.</p><p>And, of course, that will determine how much attention it gets. But, look, there is no question, Neil, that Facebook, Twitter and Google, whose executives are anti-Trump, are all left-leaning organizations. Mark Zuckerberg has talked about this. He's invited conservatives. And they have a problem.</p><p>Whether it's anecdotal or systemic remains to be seen. They also have a problem because, basically, the climate's turned against them. There's talk of government regulation. They're even resigned, I think, to government regulation. Why?</p><p>CAVUTO: From both parties, right?</p><p>KURTZ: Yes, because they have done such a terrible job of combating hate speech and bullying and Russian propaganda and all of that. They have almost invited it, because they have -- they're always apologizing for it. They're always fighting the last war.</p><p>They don't seem able to get a handle on this. But the antitrust question, look, they're successful businesses who play by the rules. I don't see the problem there. That should be separated from the complaints by Trump and Republicans of bias.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think social media in general, regardless of what role the Russians might or might not play -- and now they're worried about China and all these other entities -- that candidates are still going to leverage it all they can?</p><p>I mean, it's just a given, isn't it?</p><p>KURTZ: Absolutely.</p><p>But you know who is really bad at it, is the Democratic front-runner, Joe Biden.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>KURTZ: He puts up -- they just put up all these things about sign our petition and click on this. He doesn't say anything personal.</p><p>Trump, of course, says lots of personal things. Some people think he goes too far on Twitter. But that's -- but he makes so much news with that. And I think any candidate who doesn't learn to compete in this age of insta...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: They will regret it.</p><p>KURTZ: ... is not going to be able to...</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think a future president, though, regardless, well after Donald Trump, whether he's reelected or not, they have got to use this, and that he has set the stage to make sure they do?</p><p>KURTZ: It's like JFK using TV.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: We all live on our phones now.</p><p>And I think they may not use it in quite the same toxic way, or aggressive, the president would say, but, yes, I think the game has changed forever.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. Wouldn't that have been great, JFK on Twitter?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Had ham and eggs this morning.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: I just can't picture it. You know? What would they do? We will see.</p><p>Howard Kurtz, the host of FNC's \"Media Buzz,\" he is the definitive voice on all things here.</p><p>So this is going to be an interesting powwow. We will check back with you on how that's all going.</p><p>KURTZ: Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, just a reminder, we were down a lot more today. We finished down about 22.75 points.</p><p>As I was saying on FOX Business, everyone on tenterhooks ahead of the Federal Reserve, and, of course, China, if any trade happens there, and the latest tweet from the president.</p><p>Here comes \"The Five.\"</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

But their political woes may only worsen after next week, when the White House hosts a \"social media summit\" that could set the stage for even more scrutiny to come.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president's top aides so far have said their scheduled July 11 event aims to assemble \"digital leaders\" to discuss the \"opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\" In doing so, though, the White House quietly has invited tech's top conservative critics in politics and media, The Washington Post has learned, some of whom say the solution to Silicon Valley's perceived political bias is to break up the tech giants or more aggressively regulate them.</p><p>Among those slated to participate is PragerU, a conservative organization that produces videos about national issues that have millions of views on Facebook and YouTube. Google has limited the reach of some of PragerU's videos about Islam and guns so that they can't be viewed by those who have enabled restrictive mode, a setting that some parents and school administrators use to control what kids can access on the site. But PragerU has argued Google's efforts are evidence of Silicon Valley censorship and has sued the tech giant in federal court.</p><p>\"Big tech needs to be held accountable for their actions, and the general public needs to be aware of what's going on,\" said Craig Strazzeri, its chief marketing officer, saying he believed PragerU had been invited to the White House because of its lawsuit in federal court.</p><p>The White House on Monday declined to comment on its plans. It also has invited representatives from the conservative groups Heritage Foundation and the Media Research Center, spokespeople at each organization said. The center, founded by Brent Bozell, previously has asked the Justice Department to investigate Facebook, Google, and Twitter.</p><p>Charlie Kirk, the executive director of Turning Point USA, said in an interview Monday that he plans to attend, adding he expects the conversation to touch on questions of whether a company the size of Google is too powerful and should be investigated as a monopoly.</p><p>Facebook, Google, and Twitter declined to comment and did not say if they had been invited to join the White House.</p><p>The summit could mark a dramatic escalation in the president's war with Silicon Valley over the way tech companies police their platforms. Even though President Trump is one of social media's most prolific users, regularly broadcasting his views to more than 61 million followers on Twitter each day, he continues to claim that tech giants limit his reach and discriminate against his conservative followers online.</p><p>The White House announced its plans minutes after Trump last week newly accused Twitter of censoring him and alleged that Google rigs elections. Trump repeated his criticisms about social media companies in an interview on Fox News that aired Monday, telling host Tucker Carlson that Facebook, Google, and Twitter were \"against me\" before suggesting the administration might \"take action\" against them.</p><p>Trump's attacks have resonated with Republicans around the country, who increasingly are holding hearings, calling for regulations, and threatening investigations into Facebook, Google, and Twitter out of concern they exhibit political bias. But a wide swath of opponents \u2014 not only Democrats but free-speech experts, tech leaders, and even some fellow conservatives \u2014 stress the GOP has entered dangerous political territory.</p><p>\"Politicians, whether they're on the left or the right, shouldn't be dictating online speech codes,\" said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation policy work for Stand Together, the conservative group with ties to the Koch brothers. \"We're strong believers in free speech, period. We also believe online platforms have the right to set their own terms.\"</p><p>The planned White House meeting comes weeks after the Trump administration embarked on an unprecedented online campaign to collect stories about alleged censorship on social media, along with supporters' contact information. The White House since has disabled the survey, but it recently replaced it with a web page that says the administration received \"thousands of responses.\"</p><p>\"This has become a serious issue for a lot of people,\" Kirk said of the summit. \"They feel their voice is silenced, and they feel they're being de-platformed.\"</p><p>As soon as the White House published the survey on its website, it drew sharp criticism from congressional lawmakers and open-government advocates, who felt the Trump administration had improperly tapped federal resources for a project they said is motivated entirely by politics. Some repeated their objections Monday, citing the fact that social media companies should be doing more moderation to stop the spread of harmful content, such as online extremism, not less.</p><p>\"There is zero evidence that social media companies are biased against conservatives,\" said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, in a statement. \"In fact, the big tech companies have gone to amazing lengths to avoid confronting right-wing voices that advocate hate and racial division. This summit is a waste of taxpayer dollars intended to pressure tech companies ahead of the 2020 elections and score political points.\"</p><p>Other critics say Trump has not pointed to evidence of systemic, anti-conservative bias. At times, he's also cited anecdotes that experts have disputed. In a private, April 2019 meeting with Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, for example, the president claimed Twitter secretly reduced his followers. The company always has maintained that follower counts fluctuate because it labors to spot and remove fake bot accounts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-2d872908-9cce-11e9-a2ca-87c73bd1ef1c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGG-1P61-DYHJ-332F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1022\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.</p><p>The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren't invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting.

In his 2013 book, Who Owns the Future, computer scientist Jaron Lanier suggested that their business practices should be illegal and described social media companies as \"private spy agencies crossed with ad agencies, which are licensed by us to spy on all of us all the time in order to accumulate billions of dollars by manipulating what's put in front of us over supposedly open and public networks.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Espionage and propaganda are rife on social media sites, which generate billions of dollars off advertising that targets the vulnerable and the gullible, often without regard to the tenets that govern conventional advertising practices. The result is not only uninformed public discourse based on false and misleading information, but these platforms also provide predators the ability to defraud, pilfer and mislead the public. The fact is that spies and propagandists thrive on social media platforms.</p><p>By contrast, traditional media is bounded by timeworn principles and laws that keep commerce honest, such as truth in advertising laws and product endorsement disclosure rules. These and other rules have been around since the early 1900s to keep consumers protected from snake oil salesmen, immoral politicians, fraudsters and hucksters.</p><p>Naturally, social media is the preferred platform to pull off large-scale crimes and scams. Criminals and charlatans have had a field day during the COVID-19 crisis and some American politicians slammed social media companies for not taking responsibility for the disinformation and shenanigans that run rampant on their platforms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Google and Facebook \"amplify the most inflammatory content, no matter how dangerous or false.\"</p><p>The proliferation of false or dangerous information about COVID-19 treatments and cures litter sites like Facebook and Twitter and can cause harm to people who are looking for advice on how to protect their health.</p><p>A flood of sites selling unproven treatments or bogus cures, as well as ads selling faulty face masks and useless supplements, litter the online landscape. Some politicians have asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to look into allegations made by the Tech Transparency Project that Google helps scammers target Americans who are seeking stimulus checks.</p><p>The project alleges that those who turn to Google to search out how to access government funds are being shown ads that link to scams, phoney sites and spread malware. In its letter to the FTC, the Tech Transparency Project stated: \"We found that at least 45 of the 126 ads identified clearly violated Google's advertising policies, and only 17 linked to government or other official sources.\"</p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal concluded that, \"To truly protect consumers, the FTC must also look at the root of this recurring problem: Google's advertising practices.\"</p><p>This is nothing new. In 2019, a deluge of bitcoin scams came to light. A trade magazine, called Which magazine, warned that criminals were on sites such as Facebook, Yahoo, MSN and AOL posting fake celebrity endorsements to entice people to pour money into fake trading platforms.</p><p>The FTC estimates that one in 10 adults in the U.S. will fall victim to fraud every year, and the vast majority of those scams take place online.</p><p>There are other forms of consumer abuses perpetrated by social media companies, as well. Since 2010, the European Union has fined Google eight billion euros for violating its competition laws because its search algorithm favours its own advertisers over their European rivals, thereby illegally suppressing competition and innovation (Google controls 90 per cent of all global searches).</p><p>This year, the U.S. Justice Department finally said that it is planning to file antitrust charges against Google involving its monopolistic business practices in the online advertising industry. This will be one of the biggest antitrust cases since the late 1990s, when Microsoft was taken to court.</p><p>Social media sites should be forced to abide by the same advertising standards as everyone else, but they aren't. Until regulations force them to clean up their acts, the only protection is \"buyer beware.\"</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Since 2010, the European Union has fined Google eight billion euros for violating its competition laws because its search algorithm favours its own advertisers over their European rivals, thereby illegally suppressing competition and innovation (Google controls 90 per cent of all global searches).</p><p>This year, the U.S. Justice Department finally said that it is planning to file antitrust charges against Google involving its monopolistic business practices in the online advertising industry.

In his 2013 book, Who Owns the Future, computer scientist Jaron Lanier suggested that their business practices should be illegal and described social media companies as \"private spy agencies crossed with ad agencies, which are licensed by us to spy on all of us all the time in order to accumulate billions of dollars by manipulating what's put in front of us over supposedly open and public networks.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Espionage and propaganda are rife on social media sites, which generate billions of dollars off advertising that targets the vulnerable and the gullible, often without regard to the tenets that govern conventional advertising practices.</p><p>The result is not only uninformed public discourse based on false and misleading information, but these platforms also provide predators the ability to defraud, pilfer and mislead the public. The fact is that spies and propagandists thrive on social media platforms.</p><p>By contrast, traditional media is bounded by timeworn principles and laws that keep commerce honest, such as truth in advertising laws and product endorsement disclosure rules. These and other rules have been around since the early 1900s to keep consumers protected from snake oil salesmen, immoral politicians, fraudsters and hucksters.</p><p>Naturally, social media is the preferred platform to pull off large-scale crimes and scams. Criminals and charlatans have had a field day during the COVID-19 crisis and some American politicians slammed social media companies for not taking responsibility for the disinformation and shenanigans that run rampant on their platforms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Google and Facebook \"amplify the most inflammatory content, no matter how dangerous or false.\"</p><p>The proliferation of false or dangerous information about COVID-19 treatments and cures litter sites like Facebook and Twitter and can cause harm to people who are looking for advice on how to protect their health.</p><p>A flood of sites selling unproven treatments or bogus cures, as well as ads selling faulty face masks and useless supplements, litter the online landscape. Some politicians have asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to look into allegations made by the Tech Transparency Project that Google helps scammers target Americans who are seeking stimulus cheques.</p><p>The project alleges that those who turn to Google to search out how to access government funds are being shown ads that link to scams, phoney sites and spread malware. In its letter to the FTC, the Tech Transparency Project stated: \"We found that at least 45 of the 126 ads identified clearly violated Google's advertising policies, and only 17 linked to government or other official sources.\"</p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal concluded that, \"to truly protect consumers, the FTC must also look at the root of this recurring problem: Google's advertising practices.\"</p><p>This is nothing new. In 2019, a deluge of bitcoin scams came to light. A trade magazine called Which magazine warned that criminals were on sites such as Facebook, Yahoo, MSN and AOL posting fake celebrity endorsements to entice people to pour money into fake trading platforms.</p><p>The FTC estimates that one in 10 adults in the U.S. will fall victim to fraud every year, and the vast majority of those scams take place online.</p><p>There are other forms of consumer abuses perpetrated by social media companies, as well. Since 2010, the European Union has fined Google eight billion euros for violating its competition laws because its search algorithm favours its own advertisers over their European rivals, thereby illegally suppressing competition and innovation (Google controls 90 per cent of all global searches).</p><p>This year, the U.S. Justice Department finally said that it is planning to file antitrust charges against Google involving its monopolistic business practices in the online advertising industry. This will be one of the biggest antitrust cases since the late 1990s, when Microsoft was taken to court.</p><p>Social media sites should be forced to abide by the same advertising standards as everyone else, but they aren't.</p><p>Until regulations force them to clean up their acts, the only protection is \"buyer beware.\"</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

In his 2013 book, Who Owns the Future, computer scientist Jaron Lanier suggested that their business practices should be illegal and described social media companies as \"private spy agencies crossed with ad agencies, which are licensed by us to spy on all of us all the time in order to accumulate billions of dollars by manipulating what's put in front of us over supposedly open and public networks.\"</p><p>Espionage and propaganda are rife on social media sites, which generate billions of dollars off advertising that targets the vulnerable and the gullible, often without regard to the tenets that govern conventional advertising practices.</p><p>The result is not only uninformed public discourse based on false and misleading information, but these platforms also provide predators the ability to defraud, pilfer and mislead the public. The fact is that spies and propagandists thrive on social media platforms.</p><p>By contrast, traditional media is bounded by timeworn principles and laws that keep commerce honest, such as truth in advertising laws and product endorsement disclosure rules. These and other rules have been around since the early 1900s to keep consumers protected from snake oil salesmen, immoral politicians, fraudsters and hucksters.</p><p>Naturally, social media is the preferred platform to pull off large-scale crimes and scams. Criminals and charlatans have had a field day during the COVID-19 crisis and some American politicians slammed social media companies for not taking responsibility for the disinformation and shenanigans that run rampant on their platforms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Google and Facebook \"amplify the most inflammatory content, no matter how dangerous or false.\"</p><p>The proliferation of false or dangerous information about COVID-19 treatments and cures litter sites like Facebook and Twitter and can cause harm to people who are looking for advice on how to protect their health.</p><p>A flood of sites selling unproven treatments or bogus cures, as well as ads selling faulty face masks and useless supplements, litter the online landscape. Some politicians have asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to look into allegations made by the Tech Transparency Project that Google helps scammers target Americans who are seeking stimulus cheques.</p><p>The project alleges that those who turn to Google to search out how to access government funds are being shown ads that link to scams, phoney sites and spread malware. In its letter to the FTC, the Tech Transparency Project stated: \"We found that at least 45 of the 126 ads identified clearly violated Google's advertising policies, and only 17 linked to government or other official sources.\"</p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal concluded that, \"to truly protect consumers, the FTC must also look at the root of this recurring problem: Google's advertising practices.\"</p><p>This is nothing new. In 2019, a deluge of bitcoin scams came to light. A trade magazine called Which magazine warned that criminals were on sites such as Facebook, Yahoo, MSN and AOL posting fake celebrity endorsements to entice people to pour money into fake trading platforms.</p><p>The FTC estimates that one in 10 adults in the U.S. will fall victim to fraud every year, and the vast majority of those scams take place online.</p><p>There are other forms of consumer abuses perpetrated by social media companies, as well. Since 2010, the European Union has fined Google eight billion euros for violating its competition laws because its search algorithm favours its own advertisers over their European rivals, thereby illegally suppressing competition and innovation (Google controls 90 per cent of all global searches).</p><p>This year, the U.S. Justice Department finally said that it is planning to file antitrust charges against Google involving its monopolistic business practices in the online advertising industry. This will be one of the biggest antitrust cases since the late 1990s, when Microsoft was taken to court.</p><p>Social media sites should be forced to abide by the same advertising standards as everyone else, but they aren't.</p><p>Until regulations force them to clean up their acts, the only protection is \"buyer beware.\"</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

In his 2013 book, Who Owns the Future, computer scientist Jaron Lanier suggested that their business practices should be illegal and described social media companies as \"private spy agencies crossed with ad agencies, which are licensed by us to spy on all of us all the time in order to accumulate billions of dollars by manipulating what's put in front of us over supposedly open and public networks.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Espionage and propaganda are rife on social media sites, which generate billions of dollars off advertising that targets the vulnerable and the gullible, often without regard to the tenets that govern conventional advertising practices.</p><p>The result is not only uninformed public discourse based on false and misleading information, but these platforms also provide predators the ability to defraud, pilfer and mislead the public. The fact is that spies and propagandists thrive on social media platforms.</p><p>By contrast, traditional media is bounded by timeworn principles and laws that keep commerce honest, such as truth in advertising laws and product endorsement disclosure rules. These and other rules have been around since the early 1900s to keep consumers protected from snake oil salesmen, immoral politicians, fraudsters and hucksters.</p><p>Naturally, social media is the preferred platform to pull off large-scale crimes and scams. Criminals and charlatans have had a field day during the COVID-19 crisis and some American politicians slammed social media companies for not taking responsibility for the disinformation and shenanigans that run rampant on their platforms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Google and Facebook \"amplify the most inflammatory content, no matter how dangerous or false.\"</p><p>The proliferation of false or dangerous information about COVID-19 treatments and cures litter sites like Facebook and Twitter and can cause harm to people who are looking for advice on how to protect their health.</p><p>A flood of sites selling unproven treatments or bogus cures, as well as ads selling faulty face masks and useless supplements, litter the online landscape. Some politicians have asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to look into allegations made by the Tech Transparency Project that Google helps scammers target Americans who are seeking stimulus cheques.</p><p>The project alleges that those who turn to Google to search out how to access government funds are being shown ads that link to scams, phoney sites and spread malware. In its letter to the FTC, the Tech Transparency Project stated: \"We found that at least 45 of the 126 ads identified clearly violated Google's advertising policies, and only 17 linked to government or other official sources.\"</p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal concluded that, \"to truly protect consumers, the FTC must also look at the root of this recurring problem: Google's advertising practices.\"</p><p>This is nothing new. In 2019, a deluge of bitcoin scams came to light. A trade magazine called Which magazine warned that criminals were on sites such as Facebook, Yahoo, MSN and AOL posting fake celebrity endorsements to entice people to pour money into fake trading platforms.</p><p>The FTC estimates that one in 10 adults in the U.S. will fall victim to fraud every year, and the vast majority of those scams take place online.</p><p>There are other forms of consumer abuses perpetrated by social media companies, as well. Since 2010, the European Union has fined Google eight billion euros for violating its competition laws because its search algorithm favours its own advertisers over their European rivals, thereby illegally suppressing competition and innovation (Google controls 90 per cent of all global searches).</p><p>This year, the U.S. Justice Department finally said that it is planning to file antitrust charges against Google involving its monopolistic business practices in the online advertising industry. This will be one of the biggest antitrust cases since the late 1990s, when Microsoft was taken to court.</p><p>Social media sites should be forced to abide by the same advertising standards as everyone else, but they aren't.</p><p>Until regulations force them to clean up their acts, the only protection is \"buyer beware.\"</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

In his 2013 book, Who Owns the Future, computer scientist Jaron Lanier suggested that their business practices should be illegal and described social media companies as \"private spy agencies crossed with ad agencies, which are licensed by us to spy on all of us all the time in order to accumulate billions of dollars by manipulating what's put in front of us over supposedly open and public networks.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Espionage and propaganda are rife on social media sites, which generate billions of dollars off advertising that targets the vulnerable and the gullible, often without regard to the tenets that govern conventional advertising practices.</p><p>The result is not only uninformed public discourse based on false and misleading information, but these platforms also provide predators the ability to defraud, pilfer and mislead the public. The fact is that spies and propagandists thrive on social media platforms.</p><p>By contrast, traditional media is bounded by timeworn principles and laws that keep commerce honest, such as truth in advertising laws and product endorsement disclosure rules. These and other rules have been around since the early 1900s to keep consumers protected from snake oil salesmen, immoral politicians, fraudsters and hucksters.</p><p>Naturally, social media is the preferred platform to pull off large-scale crimes and scams. Criminals and charlatans have had a field day during the COVID-19 crisis and some American politicians slammed social media companies for not taking responsibility for the disinformation and shenanigans that run rampant on their platforms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Google and Facebook \"amplify the most inflammatory content, no matter how dangerous or false.\"</p><p>The proliferation of false or dangerous information about COVID-19 treatments and cures litter sites like Facebook and Twitter and can cause harm to people who are looking for advice on how to protect their health.</p><p>A flood of sites selling unproven treatments or bogus cures, as well as ads selling faulty face masks and useless supplements, litter the online landscape. Some politicians have asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to look into allegations made by the Tech Transparency Project that Google helps scammers target Americans who are seeking stimulus cheques.</p><p>The project alleges that those who turn to Google to search out how to access government funds are being shown ads that link to scams, phoney sites and spread malware. In its letter to the FTC, the Tech Transparency Project stated: \"We found that at least 45 of the 126 ads identified clearly violated Google's advertising policies, and only 17 linked to government or other official sources.\"</p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal concluded that, \"to truly protect consumers, the FTC must also look at the root of this recurring problem: Google's advertising practices.\"</p><p>This is nothing new. In 2019, a deluge of bitcoin scams came to light. A trade magazine called Which magazine warned that criminals were on sites such as Facebook, Yahoo, MSN and AOL posting fake celebrity endorsements to entice people to pour money into fake trading platforms.</p><p>The FTC estimates that one in 10 adults in the U.S. will fall victim to fraud every year, and the vast majority of those scams take place online.</p><p>There are other forms of consumer abuses perpetrated by social media companies, as well. Since 2010, the European Union has fined Google eight billion euros for violating its competition laws because its search algorithm favours its own advertisers over their European rivals, thereby illegally suppressing competition and innovation (Google controls 90 per cent of all global searches).</p><p>This year, the U.S. Justice Department finally said that it is planning to file antitrust charges against Google involving its monopolistic business practices in the online advertising industry. This will be one of the biggest antitrust cases since the late 1990s, when Microsoft was taken to court.</p><p>Social media sites should be forced to abide by the same advertising standards as everyone else, but they aren't.</p><p>Until regulations force them to clean up their acts, the only protection is \"buyer beware.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Sun Media Corporation.

In his 2013 book, Who Owns the Future, computer scientist Jaron Lanier suggested that their business practices should be illegal and described social media companies as \"private spy agencies crossed with ad agencies, which are licensed by us to spy on all of us all the time in order to accumulate billions of dollars by manipulating what's put in front of us over supposedly open and public networks.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Espionage and propaganda are rife on social media sites, which generate billions of dollars off advertising that targets the vulnerable and the gullible, often without regard to the tenets that govern conventional advertising practices.</p><p>The result is not only uninformed public discourse based on false and misleading information, but these platforms also provide predators the ability to defraud, pilfer and mislead the public. The fact is that spies and propagandists thrive on social media platforms.</p><p>By contrast, traditional media is bounded by timeworn principles and laws that keep commerce honest, such as truth in advertising laws and product endorsement disclosure rules. These and other rules have been around since the early 1900s to keep consumers protected from snake oil salesmen, immoral politicians, fraudsters and hucksters.</p><p>Naturally, social media is the preferred platform to pull off large-scale crimes and scams. Criminals and charlatans have had a field day during the COVID-19 crisis and some American politicians slammed social media companies for not taking responsibility for the disinformation and shenanigans that run rampant on their platforms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Google and Facebook \"amplify the most inflammatory content, no matter how dangerous or false.\"</p><p>The proliferation of false or dangerous information about COVID-19 treatments and cures litter sites like Facebook and Twitter and can cause harm to people who are looking for advice on how to protect their health.</p><p>A flood of sites selling unproven treatments or bogus cures, as well as ads selling faulty face masks and useless supplements, litter the online landscape. Some politicians have asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to look into allegations made by the Tech Transparency Project that Google helps scammers target Americans who are seeking stimulus cheques.</p><p>The project alleges that those who turn to Google to search out how to access government funds are being shown ads that link to scams, phoney sites and spread malware. In its letter to the FTC, the Tech Transparency Project stated: \"We found that at least 45 of the 126 ads identified clearly violated Google's advertising policies, and only 17 linked to government or other official sources.\"</p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal concluded that, \"to truly protect consumers, the FTC must also look at the root of this recurring problem: Google's advertising practices.\"</p><p>This is nothing new. In 2019, a deluge of bitcoin scams came to light. A trade magazine called Which magazine warned that criminals were on sites such as Facebook, Yahoo, MSN and AOL posting fake celebrity endorsements to entice people to pour money into fake trading platforms.</p><p>The FTC estimates that one in 10 adults in the U.S. will fall victim to fraud every year, and the vast majority of those scams take place online.</p><p>There are other forms of consumer abuses perpetrated by social media companies, as well. Since 2010, the European Union has fined Google eight billion euros for violating its competition laws because its search algorithm favours its own advertisers over their European rivals, thereby illegally suppressing competition and innovation (Google controls 90 per cent of all global searches).</p><p>This year, the U.S. Justice Department finally said that it is planning to file antitrust charges against Google involving its monopolistic business practices in the online advertising industry. This will be one of the biggest antitrust cases since the late 1990s, when Microsoft was taken to court.</p><p>Social media sites should be forced to abide by the same advertising standards as everyone else, but they aren't.</p><p>Until regulations force them to clean up their acts, the only protection is \"buyer beware.\"</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

In his 2013 book, Who Owns the Future, computer scientist Jaron Lanier suggested that their business practices should be illegal and described social media companies as \"private spy agencies crossed with ad agencies, which are licensed by us to spy on all of us all the time in order to accumulate billions of dollars by manipulating what's put in front of us over supposedly open and public networks.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Espionage and propaganda are rife on social media sites, which generate billions of dollars off advertising that targets the vulnerable and the gullible, often without regard to the tenets that govern conventional advertising practices. The result is not only uninformed public discourse based on false and misleading information, but these platforms also provide predators the ability to defraud, pilfer and mislead the public. The fact is that spies and propagandists thrive on social media platforms.</p><p>By contrast, traditional media is bounded by timeworn principles and laws that keep commerce honest, such as truth in advertising laws and product endorsement disclosure rules. These and other rules have been around since the early 1900s to keep consumers protected from snake oil salesmen, immoral politicians, fraudsters and hucksters.</p><p>Naturally, social media is the preferred platform to pull off large-scale crimes and scams. Criminals and charlatans have had a field day during the COVID-19 crisis and some American politicians slammed social media companies for not taking responsibility for the disinformation and shenanigans that run rampant on their platforms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Google and Facebook \"amplify the most inflammatory content, no matter how dangerous or false.\"</p><p>The proliferation of false or dangerous information about COVID-19 treatments and cures litter sites like Facebook and Twitter and can cause harm to people who are looking for advice on how to protect their health.</p><p>A flood of sites selling unproven treatments or bogus cures, as well as ads selling faulty face masks and useless supplements, litter the online landscape. Some politicians have asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to look into allegations made by the Tech Transparency Project that Google helps scammers target Americans who are seeking stimulus checks.</p><p>The project alleges that those who turn to Google to search out how to access government funds are being shown ads that link to scams, phoney sites and spread malware. In its letter to the FTC, the Tech Transparency Project stated: \"We found that at least 45 of the 126 ads identified clearly violated Google's advertising policies, and only 17 linked to government or other official sources.\"</p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal concluded that, \"To truly protect consumers, the FTC must also look at the root of this recurring problem: Google's advertising practices.\"</p><p>This is nothing new. In 2019, a deluge of bitcoin scams came to light. A trade magazine, called Which magazine, warned that criminals were on sites such as Facebook, Yahoo, MSN and AOL posting fake celebrity endorsements to entice people to pour money into fake trading platforms.</p><p>The FTC estimates that one in 10 adults in the U.S. will fall victim to fraud every year, and the vast majority of those scams take place online.</p><p>There are other forms of consumer abuses perpetrated by social media companies, as well. Since 2010, the European Union has fined Google eight billion euros for violating its competition laws because its search algorithm favours its own advertisers over their European rivals, thereby illegally suppressing competition and innovation (Google controls 90 per cent of all global searches).</p><p>This year, the U.S. Justice Department finally said that it is planning to file antitrust charges against Google involving its monopolistic business practices in the online advertising industry. This will be one of the biggest antitrust cases since the late 1990s, when Microsoft was taken to court.</p><p>Social media sites should be forced to abide by the same advertising standards as everyone else, but they aren't. Until regulations force them to clean up their acts, the only protection is \"buyer beware.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

That seems to be the question many are asking. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p>I saw this  last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" The rise of social media has brought about a  change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society  supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be particularly worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy.

That seems to be the question many are asking. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.  </p><p><br/><br/>I saw this last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" The rise of social media has brought about a change, and much of it isn't appreciated.<br/><br/>In the book, I note that although our society supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.<br/><br/>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)<br/><br/>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.<br/><br/>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be particularly worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.<br/><br/>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.<br/><br/>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy. Big Tech should be worried.<br/><br/>Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The Social Media Upheaval,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.<br/><br/>Your Turn<br/><br/>Glenn Harlan Reynolds<br/><br/>Guest columnist  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KNEWS-uscp-75pq9xk3kit3jlak895</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KNEWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9C-2FM1-F0BC-M0M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">154623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Knoxville News-Sentinel Co.

It s asharp contrast to earlier days in Trump s tenure when tech executives were occasional celebrity guests at the White House, serving as a fresh indication of the president s escalating battle with Big Tech. Now, Trump regularly accuses the big social media platforms of suppressing conservative voices. He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators. </p><p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference Thursday would bring together  digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today s online environment.  But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren t invited, their representatives confirmed. And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications. The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren t invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho. Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation. Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias. Representatives for Face-book, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday s meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry s major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet  offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.  Its members  platforms  don t have a political ideology or political bias,  the group s president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies  succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.  Thursday s conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy. Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook s lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump s 2016 campaign. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Face-book, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants  market dominance. Trump said last week on Fox News that Google, Face-book and Twitter  are fighting me hard right now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up and, frankly, so do a lot of the Republicans want to shut them up.  Asked whether tech companies may be acting illegally and whether the Justice Department should determine that, Trump replied,  Well, they could be and I don t want to even say whether or not they re doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us   to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and, frankly, against Amazon. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN68806246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ5-3X11-DYRV-4267-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

It's a win for artists, but some say the EU (and maybe America?) is going too far</p><p>In March, in cities across Europe, hundreds of thousands of protesters, most of them young people, took to the streets to protest the European Union's plan to update copyright law for the digital age. The kids, of course, had the best signs.</p><p>\"Save our cat videos!\" read one poster spotted in Berlin. Several held up signs declaring \"We are not bots!,\" a sly reference to certain politicians in favor of the new law, who claimed any opposition came from internet bots, not real EU citizens.</p><p>But the people were real. And so was their anger. The new law, officially called the Directive on Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Single Market, has been the subject of fierce debate for more than two years. The likes of Paul McCartney and Lady Gaga--as well as European directors and screenwriters including Mike Leigh and Pawel Pawlikowski --backed the directive. Big tech was opposed: YouTube and Facebook in particular, but also not-for-profit sites like Wikipedia, whose founder, jimmy Wales, joined internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee in condemning the legislation. Among the protesters, most demonstrated against the directive.</p><p>In the end, Gaga and McCartney won out. On March 26, in a vote of 348 to 274, the European Parliament approved the directive. And on April 15, at the European Council, the European Union's executive body --19 countries representing a majority of the European population, including France and Germany--endorsed the legal overhaul that, experts say, represents the biggest change to how companies can operate online since Berners-Lee came up with the idea for the World Wide Web all those years ago.</p><p>The Copyright Directive is far-reaching and has widespread--and sharply different--implications for different sections of the entertainment industry, as well as online platforms and ordinary users. One of the most radical changes is outlined in Article 17 of the directive. It reverses current law, making online platforms, and not their users, legally liable for copyright-protected songs, films, TV series or other content uploaded to their sites.</p><p>The law does not apply only to typical piracy--someone uploading the new Beyonce album or a bootleg episode of Game of Thrones --but also when, say, a parent posts a video of her child singing a song from that Beyonce album, or when a YouTuber comments on that GoT episode, using a clip from the show. This is the opposite of current U.S. law, under which the user is liable for copyright infringement and platforms have to take down material only if notified by copyright holders.</p><p>Going forward, platforms operating in the European Union will have to show that they have made their \"best efforts\" to detect and block protected content. The law also requires them to acquire licenses for the content that is shared on their sites.</p><p>The potential impact on Hollywood and Silicon Valley is enormous. Facebook and Google both earn between a quarter and a third of their revenue in Europe ($4.15 billion for Facebook last quarter, $44.5 billion for Google parent company Alphabet Inc). And the new law will affect any film or television studio--as well as any writer, director or performer--whose work is sold or distributed in Europe, a territory of some 515 million people with a collective GDP of more than $20 trillion.</p><p>The actual financial repercussions of the new legislation will depend on how it is implemented and how companies--both social media platforms and rights holders--react. But Facebook and Google could have to shell out billions in new licensing revenue to publishers, music companies and film and TV creators.</p><p>While Facebook and YouTube haven't commented directly on the EU directive, a Google spokesperson said the new law was an improvement on two-decades-old copyright legislation in Europe but \"will still lead to legal uncertainty and will hurt Europe's creative and digital economies.\"</p><p>And Europe's present could be America's future. U.S. legislators, reacting to the growing public backlash against the power and influence of the digital giants, are increasingly pointing to the European model as a solution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, speaking in April shortly after the European Parliament passed the Copyright Directive, said she supports a change in U.S. law to make internet companies responsible for what is posted on their platforms. On an April 12 podcast interview with Kara Swisher of Recode, Pelosi echoed the supporters of the EU law, saying the \"era of self-regulation\" for the likes of Facebook and YouTube should \"probably\" come to an end.</p><p>\"For the platforms, the [EU directive] is a complete paradigm shift--it changes everything,\" says Stephan Dreyer, a senior researcher in media law and media governance at the University of Hamburg in Germany. \"It completely shifts the position of power from the platforms to the rights holders. For Facebook, Google and company, it won't be easy.\"</p><p>\"It is going to be very difficult for companies to put a strategy in place,\" adds Mike Shaw, partner at Marks &amp; Clerk, a London-based group of intellectual property attorneys and consultants. \"The obvious solution would be to limit the amount of content that users are allowed to upload--to block as much as possible to avoid infringements and copyright fees. But that goes against the whole purpose of these social media platforms--they'd be accused of censorship and would lose public support.\"</p><p>Evan Engstrom, executive director of tech advocacy group Engine, which has received funding from Google, notes that even if the digital giants wanted to block everything, they wouldn't be able to. \"Upload filters just don't work like that,\" he says. \"They only work if you have a fully accurate library of all the content out there. And if you have even a slight change --a different edit, music or technical alteration --the filter can't catch it.\"</p><p>Indeed, the sheer volume of content involved is colossal. YouTube estimates that its users upload 400 hours of video content to the site every minute. The company has invested $100 million in content-matching software ContentID and, by its own estimation, has paid out more than $3 billion to rights holders since 2007. Facebook offers something similar, called Rights Manager, though it doesn't disclose the revenue it pays out to rights holders.</p><p>For many, particularly in the music business, which has seen artists' content widely distributed and pirated online, that isn't nearly enough. The music industry association IFPI notes that YouTube pays less than $1 per user in royalties to musicians, compared to around $20 per user paid by subscription streaming service Spotify. The promise of increased revenue --closing what the labels call the \"value gap\" between the demand for their content and the money the platforms pay them--is the main reason the Copyright Directive has near-universal support among musicians and major labels.</p><p>Big publishing companies--including German newspaper and magazine giant Axel Springer, which lobbied hard to push the law through--also hope the directive will close the \"value gap\" in news and journalism. A section of the legislation, Article 11, requires aggregators such as Google News to pay a \"link tax\" if they reproduce snippets or previews of an article in their search results. Wikipedia and other nonprofit or open-source platforms will be exempt. Richard Gingras, Google's vp news, has warned that the company could switch off its Google News service entirely in the EU if the \"link tax\" proves too onerous or unworkable.</p><p>But if tech companies--broadly--think the EU directive is a bad thing, and the music and news industries--broadly--welcome it, things are more complicated for the film and TV industry. The Motion Picture Association has warned that the new law hurts film and television producers by \"improving the position of platforms, but not of rights holders\" because the platforms can escape liability for copyright violation if they can show they made their \"best efforts\" to detect and block illegal content.</p><p>Production companies, including the Hollywood studios, have criticized the directive, claiming it is actually too lax when it comes to copyright protection. They note the final version of the directive does not explicitly require platforms to introduce upload filters. And smaller companies--those with less than $11 million in annual revenue or fewer than 5 million monthly unique visitors --will be exempt. \"The studios have no interest in having their material on YouTube at all,\" says Dreyer, \"so they want restrictions to be as tight as possible.\"</p><p>There is still plenty of time to debate since the European Copyright Directive won't actually be enforced until at least 2021. The individual parliaments across 27 European countries have two years to interpret the directive and write it into their own national law. Six countries--Italy, Sweden, Poland, Finland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg --actually voted against the directive, so implementation is likely to be uneven, setting the stage for legal challenges later on.</p><p>Even its harshest critics admit that the directive is unlikely to \"break the internet,\" as some activists once claimed. The lasting impact of the legislation, however, may not be seen in your Facebook feed or in YouTube's balance sheet.</p><p>\"The vast majority of users will barely notice the changes,\" Dreyer also concedes. \"But I worry about this trend. Each individual law seems reasonable enough. But slowly, systematically, we are putting limits on freedom of speech and freedom of expression.\"</p><p>GUEST COLUMN</p><p>'Copyright Protection Could Actually Be Weakened'</p><p>Charlotte Lund Thomsen, legal counsel for FIAPF, a global producers' association based in Paris, argues that the EU directive could end up having a negative effect on content creators</p><p>In the media and in the general debate, the European Copyright Directive, which the European Council approved April 15, has often been depicted as the Hollywood Major Studios vs. Silicon Valley. In fact, it has been much the opposite. The long and complex legislative process, which is not yet over, has basically been about copyright holders defending their interests in the online environment.</p><p>How you see the Copyright Directive and its impact depends on the perspective you view it from--on which glasses you put on before you look at it.</p><p>Take the \"value gap.\" Put on the music industry's glasses and you see that music, in most cases, is available in the online world without technical protection measures. Users--on YouTube or wherever--can and do share music. Given that its content is being shared this way, the music industry naturally would like to get paid for it. For them, the Copyright Directive and its provisions that require online platforms to license copyright content shared by their users are essential.</p><p>But from our perspective --representing film and TV producers from 34 member associations of 27 of the leading audiovisual production countries --the \"value gap\" is less of an issue. Our content is usually protected by technological protection measures. We, in fact, think letting end users share our films and TV series online on social media platforms would have a negative impact on our business of commercial distribution.</p><p>Take an example from my home country of Denmark: the TV series The Bridge. It was very successful in Scandinavia and sold around the world. It isn't necessarily in the producers' interest, even if they get a license fee from the online content sharing platform, to have users swapping episodes of the series on YouTube. Because that would mean they couldn't sell the show to broadcasters and it would be harder --if not impossible--to recoup their investment.</p><p>From our perspective--wearing our producers' glasses --the EU Copyright Directive is not primarily about improving copyright protection but more about finding ways for users to (legally) use copyright-protected content online.</p><p>For us, it means copyright protection could actually be weakened, in particular because the legislation provides new and wider liability privileges for platforms, carves out liability for small online sharing platforms and has provisions allowing use, for example, of copyright-protected content for educational purposes, but without assurance of payment.</p><p>This isn't just a European issue. Anyone who produces in or with Europe or who sells or distributes its content here will have to deal with the implications of the new legislation.</p><p>But there is still time for producers to continue to defend their interests in this new, post-directive environment. It is essential that as governments around Europe implement the directive, they take into consideration the way the film and audiovisual sector works in terms of development, investment, recoupment and enforcement. We will be working together with our local association members to defend producers' interests and make sure national legislators understand what the directive will mean for producers' business.</p><p>As a producer, the first practical step you can take is to contact your local production association to understand what the directive will mean for you and what you can do to ensure that you don't come up short.</p><p>Still Legal? Five Online Activities That Could Change Under the New Euro Law From memes to cat videos, the EU copyright legislation could impact anyone using the internet to post or share content online Movie EXAMPLE Going forward, platforms like Clips A YouTube star mocks YouTube will be legally liable a scene from the new if their users post unlicensed Avengers movie, using content--like a movie clip--to a clip from the film. their site. Most expect YouTube will sign deals with the big studios and record labels to make sure none of their content gets blocked. News EXAMPLE Twitter, Google News, Facebook Stories You tweet a comment and other platforms will be to a news story, required to pay a \"link tax\" quoting the original if users' posts include more story at length. than a \"short snippet\" from an original news article. Just how \"short\" and \"snippet\" are defined will be the focus of future legal battles. Music EXAMPLE It depends on how popular A comedian posts a the comedian is. Smaller parody of a new sites--ones with fewer than Beyonce song to his 5 million unique users a month own site, using the and annual revenue of less same melody as the than $11 million--will continue original. to operate under the old laws, having to license or take down content only if rights holders ask them to. Memes EXAMPLE Internet rights activists have You screen-grab an called the Copyright Directive embarrassing moment \"the death of the meme,\" but, from the Oscars, add as written, the legislation a comment and turn it explicitly protects this sort into an Instagram of freedom of expression. meme. Expect technical hiccups, however, as upload filters misidentify legal memes as illegal piracy. Personal EXAMPLE If you took the picture Photos or You find a cute yourself, you own it. But if Videos picture of a cat it's someone else's cat pic, online and post it there could be a problem. to your Facebook Still photos--among the easiest friends. content to watermark and track online--could be blocked en masse, leading to a lot of very angry cat people.--S.R.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-585718605</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 585718605</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5H-J8Y1-DYTM-90JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2585\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Prometheus Global Media LLC</copyright><publicationName>Hollywood Reporter</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0018-3660</issn><volume>Vol. 425</volume><issueNumber>No. 14</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 24, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Motion Pictures</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Arts and entertainment industries</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Copyright law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Intellectual property</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Motion picture industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Movie industry</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Patents &amp;

But a whopping 89 percent of experts in The Technology 202 Network say their responses so far do not inspire confidence. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Fighting misinformation and online voter manipulation is not a one-time effort, it is a continuous game of cat-and-mouse,\" said Hadi Partovi, chief executive of Code.org and an early investor in Facebook, Uber and Airbnb. \"The leaders of all the major online platforms would agree their job is far from 'done.' \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Technology 202 Network is a panel of more than 100 experts from across government, industry and the consumer advocacy community invited to vote in ongoing surveys on the most pressing issues in the field.  </p><p>The responsibility to tackle disinformation and other threats shouldn't just be on tech companies, some industry experts said. \"Social media companies should be doing more, but are we comfortable with [Facebook chief executive] Mark Zuckerberg or [Twitter's] Jack Dorsey as the arbiters of truth?\" said Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of  Redfin. </p><p>But Kelman says that policymakers are not really equipped to handle the problem, either. \"We elect governments, not corporations, to regulate speech, run fair elections and deter foreign interference. But most government folks lack the technical expertise to regulate the Internet, and many actually prefer a wide-open field for partisan warfare.\" </p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who represents Silicon Valley, insists that \"technology companies should be investing in authentication tools, both for users and for content, to ensure that the news Americans are seeing online this year is honest and real.\" Yet Khanna also says it is time for Congress to finally pass legislation to force companies to take action: \"Congress should also provide a basic regulatory framework so that social media companies remove blatant disinformation and hate speech that goes viral from their platforms.\" </p><p>Many experts said tech companies' lack of transparency about interference attempts makes it virtually impossible for voters to know whether adversaries are trying to influence them. </p><p>\"The first step in preventing manipulation for individuals is knowing that it may be afoot,\" said Danielle Keats Citron, a Boston University law professor and 2019 MacArthur fellow, commonly known as a \"genius grant\" recipient. \"In short, so much is hidden from voters that we cannot tell the extent of the manipulation, let alone what companies are doing about it.\"</p><p>Tech companies have promised big investments to address potential foreign interference on their platforms, including rooting out fake accounts and labeling posts that fact-checkers have deemed false. But the Network's experts say these changes are just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>The approach to tackling disinformation and other threats has been inconsistent across Big Tech, said Falon Fatemi, the chief executive of start-up Node.io. \"While some companies have invested heavily in this area and taken a proactive approach to this challenge, it is evident that some have not yet employed all that artificial intelligence can do to combat this problem,\" she wrote. \"All tech companies have a moral, and furthermore, business rationale to do better here, and to employ the latest and greatest AI for good in this uncertain time.\"</p><p>Some respondents singled out Facebook's policies as being particularly problematic: The company has said it will permit politicians to lie in ads and allow campaigns to target narrow slices of voters with political messages based on highly personalized data amassed by the company. (Google has put tougher restrictions on how political ads can be targeted.)</p><p>If Facebook wants to be serious about election integrity, it should follow Twitter's lead and do away with political ads altogether, said Karla Monterroso, the head of Code2040, a nonprofit group advocating for diversity in the industry. \"Tying money and targeted ad data to freedom of speech is ridiculous,\" Monterroso said. \"No one is entitled to that amount of data tied to a microphone in exchange for money. Especially if they are spreading lies.\"</p><p>\"Facebook won't even stop running political ads. It's hard to fathom, and Zuckerberg's reasoning is either based on extremely ulterior motives or is just hardheaded,\" said Bradley Tusk, founder of Tusk Ventures.</p><p>Several Network participants noted that the companies do not have the right incentives to fix the problems with disinformation because of their business models. \"Truly fixing Facebook's threat to free and fair elections would require fundamental changes to its business model, but Facebook is not going to risk its billion dollars a week in targeted digital advertising revenue unless it's forced to do so,\" said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at Open Markets Institute.</p><p>\"The actions of Facebook and Google since 2016 raise serious doubts about the sincerity of their commitment to protecting democracy,\"  said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley investor and author of \"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.\" \"Both companies employ business models and algorithms that amplify hate speech, disinformation, and conspiracy theories because such content is unusually profitable.

But a whopping 89 percent of experts in The Technology 202 Network say their responses so far do not inspire confidence. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Fighting misinformation and online voter manipulation is not a one-time effort, it is a continuous game of cat-and-mouse,\" said Hadi Partovi, chief executive of Code.org and an early investor in Facebook, Uber and Airbnb. \"The leaders of all the major online platforms would agree their job is far from 'done.' \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Technology 202 Network is a panel of more than 100 experts from across government, industry and the consumer advocacy community invited to vote in ongoing surveys on the most pressing issues in the field.  </p><p>The responsibility to tackle disinformation and other threats shouldn't just be on tech companies, some industry experts said. \"Social media companies should be doing more, but are we comfortable with [Facebook chief executive] Mark Zuckerberg or [Twitter's] Jack Dorsey as the arbiters of truth?\" said Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of  Redfin. </p><p>But Kelman says that policymakers are not really equipped to handle the problem, either. \"We elect governments, not corporations, to regulate speech, run fair elections and deter foreign interference. But most government folks lack the technical expertise to regulate the Internet, and many actually prefer a wide-open field for partisan warfare.\" </p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who represents Silicon Valley, insists that \"technology companies should be investing in authentication tools, both for users and for content, to ensure that the news Americans are seeing online this year is honest and real.\" Yet Khanna also says it is time for Congress to finally pass legislation to force companies to take action: \"Congress should also provide a basic regulatory framework so that social media companies remove blatant disinformation and hate speech that goes viral from their platforms.\" </p><p>Many experts said tech companies' lack of transparency about interference attempts makes it virtually impossible for voters to know whether adversaries are trying to influence them. </p><p>\"The first step in preventing manipulation for individuals is knowing that it may be afoot,\" said Danielle Keats Citron, a Boston University law professor and 2019 MacArthur fellow, commonly known as a \"genius grant\" recipient. \"In short, so much is hidden from voters that we cannot tell the extent of the manipulation, let alone what companies are doing about it.\"</p><p>Tech companies have promised big investments to address potential foreign interference on their platforms, including rooting out fake accounts and labeling posts that fact-checkers have deemed false. But the Network's experts say these changes are just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>The approach to tackling disinformation and other threats has been inconsistent across Big Tech, said Falon Fatemi, the chief executive of start-up Node.io. \"While some companies have invested heavily in this area and taken a proactive approach to this challenge, it is evident that some have not yet employed all that artificial intelligence can do to combat this problem,\" she wrote. \"All tech companies have a moral, and furthermore, business rationale to do better here, and to employ the latest and greatest AI for good in this uncertain time.\"</p><p>Some respondents singled out Facebook's policies as being particularly problematic: The company has said it will permit politicians to lie in ads and allow campaigns to target narrow slices of voters with political messages based on highly personalized data amassed by the company. (Google has put tougher restrictions on how political ads can be targeted.)</p><p>If Facebook wants to be serious about election integrity, it should follow Twitter's lead and do away with political ads altogether, said Karla Monterroso, the head of Code2040, a nonprofit group advocating for diversity in the industry. \"Tying money and targeted ad data to freedom of speech is ridiculous,\" Monterroso said. \"No one is entitled to that amount of data tied to a microphone in exchange for money. Especially if they are spreading lies.\"</p><p>\"Facebook won't even stop running political ads. It's hard to fathom, and Zuckerberg's reasoning is either based on extremely ulterior motives or is just hardheaded,\" said Bradley Tusk, founder of Tusk Ventures.</p><p>Several Network participants noted that the companies do not have the right incentives to fix the problems with disinformation because of their business models. \"Truly fixing Facebook's threat to free and fair elections would require fundamental changes to its business model, but Facebook is not going to risk its billion dollars a week in targeted digital advertising revenue unless it's forced to do so,\" said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at Open Markets Institute.</p><p>\"The actions of Facebook and Google since 2016 raise serious doubts about the sincerity of their commitment to protecting democracy,\"  said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley investor and author of \"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.\" \"Both companies employ business models and algorithms that amplify hate speech, disinformation, and conspiracy theories because such content is unusually profitable. Rather than compromise their business models, both companies have made only cosmetic changes to appease policymakers.\" </p><p>Rampant disinformation disproportionately affects minority groups, warned Rashad Robinson, the president of the civil rights group Color of Change. \"Make no mistake, these platforms know they have a problem - they acknowledged it in 2016 and they are aware of it today,\" he said. \"Yet these companies are making an active choice not to do more to end misinformation online, and that choice will disproportionately harm the communities most in need of the resources determined by elections and the upcoming census count.\"</p><p>Just 11 percent of the Network - which includes executives from most major social networks - said companies are doing enough.</p><p>Kevin Martin, Facebook's vice president for public policy and FCC chairman during the George W.

His reported 3% stake in Twitter would be worth more than $300m if the company achieves the $15bn plus valuation ascribed to it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He will not be the only tech mogul to realise a huge payday from the IPO, which was announced via Twitter on Thursday. The company has the backing of a galaxy of Silicon Valley's top investors including Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, and Netscape's co-founder Marc Andreessen. Chief executive <person><nameText>Dick Costolo </nameText></person>is an investor too, as are Dorsey's co-founders Biz Stone and Ev Williams. But it's unclear how much each of them will benefit.</p><p>Twitter is taking advantage of new rules to start its initial public offering (IPO) under the radar. But as it did with Facebook, the last big tech IPO, the tech establishment looks set to make a killing. Facebook's share sale, however, proved controversial and costly as the social network's early investors cashed out before an embarrassing collapse in the share price. Twitter will no doubt be keen to avoid the same mistake.</p><p>If the sale goes smoothly Twitter could come to market at the end of this year and be worth as much $15bn, according to PrivCo, which gathers information on private companies.</p><p>\"Twitter will learn from Facebook's flawed playbook and do the opposite,\" PrivCo's chief executive, Sam Hamadeh, predicted. \"Unlike Facebook, which waited too long to IPO (until its growth rate had decelerated), Twitter will IPO at just the right point: while revenue grows in triple digits.\"</p><p>Twitter has told staff it is sometimes profitable - but it is likely that the company is loss-making most of the time. The company is spending to drive growth. Earlier this week it paid a reported $300m for MoPub, a mobile ad technology firm and the eighth company it has acquired this year.</p><p>Going public will give Twitter another currency - its shares - to finance new deals but how much money it will raise and how much money it is making, remain a mystery. Twitter has filed for a confidential initial public offering under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act. The act allows Twitter to consult the regulators privately before the share sale, outside the glare of publicity that the IPO would otherwise receive.</p><p>PrivCo believes the float will be \"conservatively priced\" at 20 to 30 times revenue. With 2013 revenues expected to exceed $500m, this would make Twitter worth between $10bn and $15bn.</p><p>Alan Patrick, founder of the Broadsight consultancy, said that at $14bn Twitter was valuing its user at about $58 each, about half the ratio Facebook had at its IPO. \"Yes it's hyped but it's not as stupidly hyped as Facebook was,\" he said. Patrick said there appeared to be plenty of room for growth at Twitter. \"I actually see Twitter as a communications system rather than a social network. I think there are other things that can be done with it. With 240 million users there's room to grow, whereas Facebook with one billion users had less room for growth.\"</p><p>Facebook has recovered from its disastrous IPO last May and its shares hit an all-time high this week, driven up by positive signs for mobile revenues. This may be good news for Twitter, whose early forays into advertising have been a success, particularly on the increasingly important smartphone screen. Twitter is expected to earn $582.8m in global ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer, before growing to nearly a billion in 2014. More than half of the company's ad revenues are expected to come from mobile ad revenue this year, in the US and globally.</p><p>Patrick's one concern is management. Facebook put together a steely management team that has stood it in good stead as it fought back from its IPO pratfall. Twitter has until recently appeared somewhat less focused.</p><p>As the IPOs of Groupon, Zynga and even the mighty Facebook have shown in recent years, hot tech companies do not necessarily make great share sales. It's too early to say whether Twitter will be any different.</p><p>But it will undoubtedly be one of the most closely watched IPOs for years - 140 characters at a time.</p><p>Captions:</p><p>First tweet was \"just setting up my twttr\" by</p><p>@Jack and was on 21 March 2006</p><p>The company was founded 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone and Evan Williams.

First of all, I mean, I'm not sure we need to reiterate how important the digital world, new technologies are for the world of banking. You've mentioned in your answer a 50% interface. We understand that, of course, the clients is very important. It changes -- they change their habits. We can discuss about the pace, the magnitude of the transformation, but it changes the habit.</p><p>Clearly, we are facing potentially new competitors. The digital technology can bring down barriers of entry, in particular, I think, in the B2C business. Regulators, they are still in a learning curve, let's face it, with, of course, certain elements regarding, for example, infrastructure and security, cyber risk, but also they are entering into a new world of regulation and I think that we're all facing the world of data, for example, regulation, which is fundamentally new. The new technologies themselves, as you know, they are changing permanently. I must say, probably in terms of industrial usage, we are still at the beginning, but you will see that it is already a reality for certain businesses and certain experiences.</p><p>The war for talent, may I say, it's a crucial element. And when I say this, the talents of tomorrow might not be the talents we were fighting for of the past and, of course, new risks, in particular the cyber risk, which has become, probably, maybe today one of the biggest worries of investors.</p><p>What I like to tell you is in this world, where so much is changing, I have really a conviction that, in order to succeed, there are some key elements. We need to be customer-focused, driven by data. We need to have definitely the infrastructure, technological infrastructure, which will enable us to embark in the transformation and keep, I would say, an entrepreneurial mindset. And you will see, this morning, some examples of initiatives with this key dimension, which is that you need to be able to experiment. You need to be able to fail and effectively accept failure. It's not easy in, I would say, traditional companies.</p><p>I'd like to tell you also and share with you one, and I'm a little bit simplistic, but key element, in my mind, in terms of to what extent these technologies will impact the B2C on one hand and the B2B or B2B2C space on the other. Regarding the wholesale activities, it's very clear, and you will see examples. We have Frank Drouet, Head of our Capital Market activities. Alain Fischer who is in charge of developing the digital world within our wholesale activities, which we'll show you, in practice, how we develop new tools, how we interact with our clients precisely with digital technology, which shows that these businesses will also change.</p><p>And at the same time, when I think about the relationship, the core relationship between the bank and the client, I believe that, despite these changes, the relationship will remain also handled by a banker. I do not believe that, given the complexity of this relationship, the diversity, the complexity, again, of this relationship with a corporate or a large investor, you will easily just deal with digital technologies at least in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Regarding retail clients. On the other hand, we have here different models in mind. And you will have also a presentation by Philippe Aymerich, Bruno Delas on how we see the transformation of our French retail network. You will also have examples of what we do outside France with Didier, again, and some demonstrations of initiatives.</p><p>Here, depending on the clients, at least for the next 10 years, you will have certain models which will combine presence on the ground and digital channels but also models where, such as Boursorama, the clients is very happy to deal with a bank with no presence on the ground, with no identified banker as an interface. And I think, personally, the disruption in the B2C, going forward, will be more important fundamentally because overall the relationship is a little bit less complex, but in essence, when you talk about millions of clients, it's typically the world of mobile which allows to market in a personalized way at a very cheap cost. When you talk about the world of corporates, you talk about 1,000, 2,000 core strategic, large corporates, 100,000 maybe SMEs. The granularity of this client base is lower.</p><p>Let me now just explain how we try to think about transforming and you will see that these elements will be present in all our presentations today. First, this idea of being open. Open, what does that mean? First of all, we need to be open and modular in our IT architecture. It's absolutely crucial. We will enter into detail to explain to you how we think this new architecture, both on the retail banking side and the wholesale banking side, and you will see we make a comparison with Lego. The idea is to have a kind of Lego architecture in IT putting elementary pieces of Lego together with this world of API, as you will see, and I think it's important to have that in mind.</p><p>Second, very importantly, open innovation. Open innovation, what does that mean? That means being, of course, able to interact with this world of start-ups, open innovation. And Claire Calmejane, who has joined us 4 months ago to run our innovation overall and transversal initiatives, will explain to you how we interact. But one thing which is also very important is this concept of open source.</p><p>Open source that means that instead of just dealing with external providers that you pay, you are able to access a world of people, developers, who think that actually their contribution to the world is to provide for free their skills, their expertise, who are able to size, if I may, take your apps, your APIs, enrich them, improve them, and give it back to you. It's a world, also, where you can start to think, and I will leave again the specialists about this to talk to you about this, able to compete with the traditional, the database, providers and have also the capacity to work with people which provide infrastructure, this kind of elements for free.</p><p>And of course, perhaps even more importantly, open banking. The idea is to say, instead of having thinking in terms of a silo of banking services, the idea is to say how can I build a service platform offering, which is, again, as open as possible, as able as possible to partner with other companies. And that means, in particular, in order to do that, beyond the capacity to be, of course, competitive in terms of price and quality of service, certain IT infrastructure. And that's why I think it's so important to spend some time on that and understand where we want to go.</p><p>The second element is agility. And agility, it can mean a lot. Can I start with IT development? And here again, I will ask you in the room to raise your hands, it's the fourth question, I'm sorry about this. But just who has, among you, spent just time to understand what agile development means in the IT world? Can I ask who has done that? One, yes sir, my guys, of course, I hope, you don't count. Can I just elaborate? It's a fundamental revolution of IT development.</p><p>Let me just -- I will take 2 or 3 minutes more than I was supposed to, but, I mean, it's a fundamental thing. It's our factories, the IT systems. In the past of so far, the idea was to launch big projects, 3-year projects, EUR 50 million budget, et cetera. I think, fundamentally, the more I think about it, no one actually, when you do that, has a clue of how long it will last and how much it will cost. And there are many failures and I guess you have experienced yourself some failures everywhere, not just in banking. And it's a process of building, manufacturing IT systems, which is very sequential with many people translating step by step from the business people who have sometimes actually just a vague idea of what they wish, to the end of the chain, the developers who are the ones who are able to code in the machine these expressions of needs of functionalities but you have different people in the value chain and, actually, it's like the film Lost in Translation.</p><p>The ability to do that effectively without actually changing or not understanding what it means is detrimental, so you have people who are developing, sequentially translating and then, 6 months later, you'll receive a first lot of functionalities and the business people and function people, oh my goodness, it's not at all what I wanted.</p><p>The beauty of agile development is that you put together in the same room, people from the business and people from the IT and you develop with very short cycles on a daily basis, or maybe on a 2-week basis, which means that, if you are developing something which does not correspond actually to the need of the business or the function, you can correct immediately. The risk of going in a bad direction is just limited to less than 1 day and you can amend immediately and you see immediately the result -- the people, the business and function see immediately the result.</p><p>So I really believe that this new methodology of development is a revolution to be much more effective beyond the amount of money you want to spend on IT overall in what you are developing and it's a revolution because effectively on top of that, instead of adding 2 worlds where -- different worlds, the business and functions on one hand and the IT guys, there is a need and a benefit to put these 2 worlds together.</p><p>Can I just say that agile, of course, beyond what we do in IT, goes beyond, of course, with the need to rethink the whole organization, having much more transversal organization than hierarchal organization and that goes to the work and the way to organize the work.</p><p>And third, the focus. The focus is to say -- I mean, when you think about this world of technology, et cetera, we could spend billions of euros and maybe deliver nothing. We try, in Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, and I hope you will feel that when you will see the presentation during this morning, we try effectively to develop things with a business -- a clear business requirement. We try to ensure that when we launch something, an experiment, there is effectively business people who are involved, engaged and, of course, the IT resources, which will correspond to the capacity to develop.</p><p>I think it's important, and my own conviction has always been, that this world of innovation has to start from the client, has to start from the client experience and potentially identifying where there are pain points, where there is a capacity to improve very much this client experience. So the bulk of the resources, the bulk of the initiatives have to be close to the ground, a little bit in line with what I said. Of course, you have also, then, to have an IT infrastructure, IT people who are close to the business.</p><p>That does not mean that this series of initiatives should not be, of course, coordinated, organized, neutralized as much as possible to avoid duplication, and that's where you will see, again, people like Christophe Leblanc, who is in charge of our transversal resources, as well as Claire, who will explain to you how we precisely organized this transversality and have effectively a common framework, in particular, regarding, of course, infrastructure and cloud, but not just that.</p><p>Let me now just conclude this introduction by saying really, and that was what we said during our strategic -- the presentation of our strategic plan. In 10 years' time, I really would like to have a bank which is fundamentally fully digitalized, where all the processes, front to back, are digitalized with effectively a capacity to take into account a revolution in the way we are doing business, in particular, with data management. Data management, for me, is a key transformation and, of course, a very open banking platform and architecture.</p><p>Can I just leave with you a few convictions? First of all, beyond a technology revolution, and it is an industrial revolution because I've just mentioned that, again, our factories, the way to produce, equip -- implement our factories are fundamentally changing. It's first and foremost a cultural revolution because you have to have your staff embarking in a journey, understanding that, if they want to think about the services going forward, the relationship, they have to have this knowledge, this understanding and even more, probably, some capacity to interact with the IT in a totally different way.</p><p>Myself, as you know, I'm spending some time to code because I want to understand. And it's fascinating, I would like to insist, it's fascinating to see them, just in a few hours, in a few days, you can develop new functionalities in an app, you can enrich an API, which means developing, testing the product to ensure it works and enter into production in such a short cycle, and that request the business people, the function people to have this knowledge and thinking totally different way on their added value going forward.</p><p>I really believe, fundamentally, this transformation is not a risk, it's more of an opportunity for banks. It's an opportunity to deliver a better service to the clients. The traditional banking services, at this stage, do not -- I'm not the champion of the world in terms of Net Promoter Score, client satisfaction, I have really the conviction that the banks which will succeed in their fundamental transformation will make a very significant progress in their client satisfaction, and of course, in terms of cost efficiency, it will also be in my mind, a key driver for cost efficiency because, as I've said, IT development will be more efficient and you will save a lot of cost in dealing with low added value, still today, sometimes, manual processes, which will be automated, thanks to this digitalization.</p><p>Last thing I just would like to say it will be a long journey. You cannot transform a bank from where we stand like this to this just in a few quarters. But you will see also that even if it's a long journey, there will be, effectively, progressive and regular tangible benefits in the way we do our business and again you, will see that the reality is already there.</p><p>Last thing, as I've said, but it's up to you, each of us should feel committed to that. I can tell you, as the CEO I do it myself, it's very important. We -- I tend to think, to a certain extent, I have change of jobs, at least I change the time allocation I have and I spend, of course, much more time on these technology issues, which are becoming more and more important for our own strategy. That's what I wanted to say.</p><p>The program, if I can have it just on the slide. So as I've said, we'll start with the French retail banking business, Philippe Aymerich, Deputy CEO in charge of these businesses; Bruno Delas, in charge of our service unit called IT, which is the dedicated IT teams to the French retail; then Didier Hauguel will actually present briefly the panorama of what we are doing in our international retail banking and financial services, and we will propose actually to you to go to the sixth floor and just have demos. It will be to our board with the first session and you will see a little bit -- you will see concrete examples, 10 minutes, I think per initiative. Then after, probably, a break, again, Frank Drouet, Head of our Capital Markets, and Alain Fischer, in charge of the digital transformation in our wholesale world, will present to you also very, very specifically how we deal with that. And then we will conclude with Christophe Leblanc and Claire Calmejane, where we'll provide a wrap up on our, again, global strategy and transversal initiatives.</p><p>Thank you very much for your attention. And I now leave the floor to you, Philippe.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH, DEPUTY CEO, SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9N\u00c3\u00a9RALE SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 ANONYME: Good morning to all of you. So with Bruno today, we are very pleased to be with you to give you an overview of digital transformation we've seen in French Retail. And I have to tell you that, as Deputy CEO in charge of French Retail, that I have, of course, 2 major goals. The first one is client satisfaction and the second one, it's growing profitability. And to achieve these 2 goals, digital transformation, of course, is one of the key levers. But we'll try to do it to answer 3 questions. The first one it's why do we think we can be successful in digital transformation. The second one it's how we are doing it, especially from an IT standpoint, and Bruno will go into some details. And the third question is what are the results already of this digital transformation.</p><p>Very briefly, before answering these questions, I would like to summarize what is at stake. And to make it short to a certain extent, the answer could be digitalize or die, but we thought keeping in mind clients reality in the transition period. Digitalize or die because obviously, I mean, we know that the momentum is very strong. We are already in this digital new world and, as Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric said, there are 2 major impacts. The first one is the impact on the behaviors of our clients. You know that when there is a new best usage in some industry, it becomes very quickly the new reference in the market, whatever is the industry.</p><p>The second impact is that we are facing new competitors, new entrants, GAFAs, FinTechs, neobanks, retailers, telcos. So they have not moved yet the market shares, but definitely they have an impact. The frontiers between the industries are disappearing, but at the end of the day, we have the same goal for everybody, access to data.</p><p>But we have also to keep in mind that the tempo, the level of digitalization of the economy is not the same in every country, is not the same in every geography. In the case of France, our market, the digitalization of the economy is still uneven. I just want to give you some facts. 50% of the transactions are still made by cash in France. I also want to mention that we still have more branches in France versus the average of European countries. It's not a [bit unique] because the predominant actors, the mutual banks, are still promoting a broad physical approach. And regarding our individual clients, of course, many of them are already very comfortable with the digital experience, but for others, it's not obvious yet. And in the process we are doing, it's very important to make sure that we are not losing core clients during this transition period.</p><p>Before going into details, I would like or so to remind you very briefly our setup in France. As you know, we have 3 banks: Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale itself, Credit du Nord and Boursorama. We consider that as a real strength. It's a real strength because it enables us to cover a large spectrum of clients' expectations with 3 different value propositions.</p><p>The first one is Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, a very powerful universal bank with a strong franchise on corporates, private banking, mass affluent clients and a unique capacity to deliver both the digital experience and relationship banking.</p><p>We have Credit du Nord, which is a premium bank, focused on SMEs, professional, also mass affluent clients, with very strong regional roots and with a tradition of expertise and quality of service.</p><p>And finally, we have, as mentioned by Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric, Boursorama, pure online banking so, of course, fully dedicated to digital clients.</p><p>But what is also important to mention is that these 3 banks are not acting on a standalone basis. We are sharing a lot. We are sharing, of course, best marketing practices. We are sharing corporate functions. We are sharing real estate management. We are sharing IT infrastructure. We are sharing IT security, which is so critical for business, but even more importantly, and Bruno will explain that to you, we are sharing many IT components and, for example, just one, you know that in our apps, we have a function which is very important to the client, this is the aggregation of accounts and documents.</p><p>This function has been developed by Boursorama with the acquisition of Fiduceo, and within the month after, has been deployed in the apps of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale and in the apps of Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit du Nord. And finally, just to finalize my point on that, we are also sharing operating platforms, for example, for finance, on consumer credit, on transactions for payments.</p><p>So now we'll go more into details, and I will start by Boursorama. Boursorama, as I said, is a pure online bank. So it's already at the digital target by definition. Boursorama is best-in-class. It focuses on the best user experience at the best price in a very open architecture mindset. This being said, it is also a fully-fledged bank with a complete offer to address all the client needs, and it relies on a very efficient setup, operating platform. Boursorama has less than 800 employees.</p><p>Boursorama does deliver. We have reached 1.6 million of clients. We will reach the 2 million number of clients by the end of 2019, which means 1 year before what was planned during the Investor Day. And also Boursorama is acquiring clients who are real clients, I mean, they are not only using day-to-day banking functions of Boursorama but they are also buying products and services, namely savings accounts, insurance, life insurance, consumer credit, mortgages.</p><p>And the last point I want to mention for Boursorama is that, and we are very proud of that, the level of satisfaction of the client is very high. The Net Promoter Score is above 40%.</p><p>So for Boursorama, the road map is very clear. Keep the momentum in terms of expanding and developing the client base and remain at the forefront of innovation. I will give you an example, maybe you have seen that, we have signed a partnership with Google Home, which means that Boursorama has been the first -- is the first bank in France to offer an Internet of Things application to its customers.</p><p>So now digital transformation related to the 2 mature networks, Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale and Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit du Nord. I would say 2 strategic goals, 2 pillars regarding the operating model, 2 levers. The 2 strategic goals, they were mentioned by Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric and by myself at the very beginning, client satisfaction because it is key for today and for the future. It is key to develop our client base and also to increase the clients equipment rate. Second strategic goal, of course, is to improve our efficiency in order to execute operations better so to address all the risk and compliance issues at a lower cost. So 2 strategic goals.</p><p>Two pillars regarding our business model. The first one is to be an efficient producer for all standard operations, and Bruno will show you real life examples of these automations. And the second pillar is to offer a high level of expertise for key projects of our clients, corporates, professional, individuals, with tailor-made solutions and advisory services.</p><p>Finally the 2 levers, the first one is IT and the challenge here is to combine the strength, the robustness of our core banking system with the flexibilities of new technologies. And the second lever is our staff, with many ongoing initiatives to upskill our teams, front office, back office, IT because, of course, there will be no digital transformation without them.</p><p>So now, I will leave the floor to Bruno, which is going to go more into details to explain to you what is going on from an IT standpoint and the choices we made. And I will come back to share with you the results of this transformation.</p><p>BRUNO DELAS, HEAD OF INNOVATION &amp; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN FRENCH RETAIL BANKING, SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9N\u00c3\u00a9RALE SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 ANONYME: Thank you, Philippe. Hello, everyone. So as Philippe just mentioned, the client expectations are evolving very quickly. The clients need more and more a trusted bank, available 24/7 and accessible through multiple channels.</p><p>So to answer this client need, Philippe asked me a very simple question in 2015 and the question is, how can we digitalize our information system. Maybe I need to switch, okay. How can we digitalize our information system to answer these new client needs? And he also asked me, could we be agile enough to deliver value regularly and in the long term.</p><p>So to answer this question, there is 2 main options. Option 1, build a new digital system from scratch, like the new age bank, and option 2, build around our strong existing system. Maybe this is a new question for [Klaxoon], but let me try to answer this question. For sure, the option 1 is very attractive, but it seems to us too risky. This is why we have chosen option 2. Not only because this is the more economical but also because our core banking system is very robust and very rich. Definitely, we have chose this option 2 because this is the best to deliver the best-in-class customer experience and to deliver with a minimum of risk.</p><p>I am sure that the question that you have is, okay, but how does it work. To answer this question, let me go more deeper within the core banking system and the information system of the French retail. At the starting point, there is nothing. At the starting point -- there is something for sure. At the starting point, in 2015, the core banking system, in yellow, was mainly connected to the adviser in the branches and sometimes connected to the client mostly to check their account.</p><p>If I go deeper on the core banking system, you can see that we have a lot of offering products, roughly 400. We have also lots of multiple data belonging to our 10 million clients, and you also need to know that this core banking system is capable of processing millions of transactions per day. That was the starting point.</p><p>The digital strategy that we put in place is composed of 4 steps. The first step is about the interaction between the client and the bank. And during this transformation, we have created 2 things. We have enriched the mobile and the web application, delivering new services coming from the core banking and accessible through APIs, and we also put in place a new digital exchange hub. And thanks to this digital exchange hub, the client can upload some documents, the adviser can push some contracts, and the client can sign these contracts. The 2 channels are completely interoperable.</p><p>The second type of transformation is about the data hub. We have started by creating, in blue, a data lake, which [fills] with all the data coming from the core banking system, all the data coming from the client journey, and we also complete the data lake with some external data. After that, we put in place a set of machine learning tools. And thanks to the data and the tools, our data scientists are able to maximize the marketing analysis. They are able to improve the security protection and so on and so on.</p><p>The third type of transformation is about the data process hub. To create this digital process hub, we started by putting in place business process management tools, and we complete these business process management tools by some digital brick. Digital like e-signing or uploading of documents, but we also use some artificial intelligence tools like facial recognition. And thanks to the digital bricks and the VPM, we can redesign all our processes in a front to back manner using, for the client, a very good user experience because we switch with digital brick and the core banking through APIs.</p><p>The last digital transformation is about the business platform hub. We connected new business platform hub to the core banking and, for example, as Philippe mentioned, the first business platform that we connected was Fiduceo to aggregate all the data in a single place coming from other banks or other providers. So it was our digital transformation in 4 steps, and we also tried to be very agile to complete this digital transformation by creating a new open banking platform. We are launching this platform at the end of this year.</p><p>So thanks to this transformation, we are now capable to address the 5 major client expectations, which are client knowledge, client experience, new digital services, new ways to pay and client autonomy.</p><p>Let's start with the client knowledge. The client wants to be known and recognized by the bank and the adviser. To answer this need, we are putting in place a lot of tools, like number recognition, like voice recognition. We also have put in place a tool to share the same screen between the client and the adviser when they need some help. But the most important tool that we put in place is a real-time dashboard called 360 client view, and thanks to this dashboard, we are capable to put in a single place all the interaction between the client and the bank in the real time. But I will let Philippe, in a few minutes, tell a little bit more about these tools.</p><p>Client experience. The clients want, more and more, a seamless experience. This is why we have created a digital road map for all our processes. And as you can see, we are doing this digital road map not only for the private but also for the professional and the corporate, and we are halfway there.</p><p>New digital services. You know that the clients want to access and manage in one single place all their accounts, all their bills, all their wealth assets. To answer this question, we have shared the Fiduceo platform with Boursorama. And thanks to this platform, we are best-in-class for the personal finance management for the client, but we also benefit from all these data to put in place new digital services. And, for example, we have launched recently a total new digital investment platform called Synoe. And thanks to Synoe, you can push advice to your client to improve your asset portfolio regarding the client risk. Here is a short demo of Synoe.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>BRUNO DELAS: I hope that you believe me when I said that we are better in IT than in translation. Next step, the new ways to pay. The clients really want to test new ways to pay, but they want to do that securely. And we know that we invest a lot in security, and we continue to invest to stay at the forefront. And if I give you just some examples, we have launched 2 secured cards, the first one, I'm sorry, it's very small. This is a biometric -- no, this one is not the biometric. This one is a cryptodynamic card, and the code is changing every hour, and you can secure all your Internet payments. The second one is a biometric card. And with this card, you can recognize your fingerprint and you have no code to tap.</p><p>We also are in the starting block to launch the instant payment at the end of November. And we can launch all these new ways of payment because we have put in place an artificial solution that allows the bank to detect all the fraudulent transfers in real time, and this is this one on the left -- on the right.</p><p>The last expectation but not the least is about client autonomy. You know that the clients need a lot of autonomy. So we have a famous app, and we enriched this famous app with a lot of new functions in different topics, but the better way than to explain it is to show you. Let me connect to my app and show you some of these new functions. So I hope that the technique will be okay. Normally, my hub will be on the screen. I've got to back up normally, but something the matter? Okay, maybe it's my fault. I do it again. Okay. So let me launch, excuse me?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible)</p><p>BRUNO DELAS: It's all the accounts, and it's my personal, so I will show the demo very quickly. So when you start, you have an indicator to know the amount on your own account. Of course, you can go down to see more about your account, and we have put in place a touch ID to recognize and to be sure that you are allowed to do that. So I put my fingerprints. Okay, you can see all your accounts within Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. And of course, you can now go to other banks, I click on other bank. Boursorama for sure, but yes, you (inaudible) and you can see all the accounts that you want to consolidate in one single place, and you can also, for sure, add new bank. And you can add every bank that you want, for example...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Only in France or all over Europe?</p><p>BRUNO DELAS: For the moment, only in France. For the moment, only in France. Okay, so let's go back to the homepage. On the homepage, we can go on card. I have one single card, but you can put many. And with this app, you can now do many things on your cards. You can change the amount, the monthly amount. You can change the capacity of withdrawal but you can also explain that you are going in a foreign country and you want to be sure that your card is available during your stay, and you can also cancel your card, and all these functions are in real time. If you want to buy something on the website, you cannot, you go on your app, you move up your account and you can buy immediately after.</p><p>Maybe just a little last one. For sure, in insurance, you can now simulate and create a contract for your car, for example. You go under apps, you go further, and you can do very easily the simulation, you choose your car, you put in place the following. You can also ask -- if you are not able to go further, you can also ask to be called back by an adviser, and you do that, and it's very surprising, but you can do that very quickly.</p><p>Okay so maybe the last one, I don't know because it was about -- and for the last one, for example, you can see all the accounts, and all the operations coming from all the accounts that you have in different banks. And this is the personal finance management, and you could also see all your operations by category. And this is why this application is very famous and very useful.</p><p>So maybe I will stop there. Okay, so to sum up, we are sure that we have the right digital transformation strategy. And to prove it, I propose to let the floor to Philippe to give the results on the ground.</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: Yes. We would like to share with you the hard facts. You see that your [lease] confirmation is really taking care -- taking place and we'll address 3 components of our business: financial update, marketing approach and the consequences, the impacts of all of that on our front office, on back office setup. So regarding client usage, I will do it briefly because Bruno has already told you a lot.</p><p>You see some numbers. The client using our app is growing very quickly, by 30% during the last 2 years. We have 94% of domestic transfers which are already executed by the client directly through the app or the website. We have a similar trend on international transfers. You see that now. It has increased from 30% to 67% of international transfers are performed directly by the client. We have also a significant increase on all the self-care related to credit card. And finally, there is a jump on the electronic signature because, for many other products now, we have up to 35% of eligible contracts which are signed by electronic signature.</p><p>So in a nutshell, the clients are taking advantage of the new digital functionalities presented by Bruno. Of course, we continue to develop toward new services through the -- in the website, in the app that we have also in mind all what is going on, on the Internet of Things world. And, of course, we want to continue to be up to clients' expectations.</p><p>Second impact, and I will detail more on our marketing approach. Because that's true that digitalization allows to optimize and personalize our marketing approach with, of course, a very responsible usage of data because we want to remain a trusted partner of our clients. So we are very careful about that. I want to give you 4 illustrations. The first one, which was mentioned by Bruno, is a 360 vision of our interactions with the clients. So we have this tool, which has been implemented last year, which captures every single transaction, interactions between the client and the bank. It could be a part of his digital journey, it could be a call to the branch, it could be a call to a call center, it could be a visit to a branch. And these informations are shared within the bank, which means that we are aware of the situation of the client, his projects, his problems. And when we -- and we can give him a quick answer without asking him again to explain what his problem is. So this tool implemented last year has radically changed the way we are more proactive with our clients.</p><p>Second example is that, of course, the digital tools allow us to detect client interest during his digital journey and to propose some support. I'm going to give you an example. If a client is on the website doing a simulation on consumer credit, for example, we can reach him. So we have been very cautious with that because, of course, we didn't want to be too intrusive. So we have done it very progressively. But what we have seen is that the clients actually are very comfortable, most of the time, with this call because it helps them to finalize the process, to have additional advice and to have, yes, an interaction with a human being. And this task is, most of the time, done by our call centers.</p><p>Example number three is that big data technologies allows us to promote the right offer at the right time, at the right moment to the client. So it's not new for individual clients. We have done it for some years. But we are also doing that now with professionals. It seems a bit strange, but we have seen that it works also quite well with professionals. And for example, the last campaign of Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit du Nord proposing overdraft facilities to the clients with a scoring tool, of course, has worked very well because you can see that it was 3x more effective than the previous one. So it's not only on the individual segment, but also with professionals. And the last example, it's from a marketing standpoint. I can take the example, again, of Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit du Nord, which has developed a tool called the BlueBox, which is able to aggregate many data, many information about the clients, not only the current value of the client, but also its potential, its behavior, its digital journey in all tools on the Internet. And so, with that, we are able to have a much more precise effective segmentation. And with this new segmentation, we are not only able to have more precise marketing actions but also that's part of the tools helping us to reconfigurate, to refocus, to specialize our front offices. So that's that the transition to the third impact, which is the impact of all these evolutions, so more client autonomy, new marketing tools and automated processes front to back, the impact on the front office and back office set up. I will start with front office. So you have seen that the clients are more digital, and they are doing much more things themselves. Simultaneously, we have continued to develop our ATM, which are no longer only delivering cash. They still do deliver cash, but the client can also do more things with the ATM machine, printing an IBAN, doing a transfer. So all this combination has 2 impacts on our front office. The first one, and we are well aware of that, is that it reduces the workload on our branches. So with this reduction of workload we have done 2 things. The first thing, and you can see the numbers here, is that, yes, we have reduced the number of our branches, and we will continue to do that by approximately 100 per year, first impact. The second impact and probably, on the long term, more important is that we are increasing the added value provided by the relationship managers and the branches. So we have done 2 things. We are specializing our relationship managers because the one size fits all doesn't work anymore. I mean, the clients, they want specific advice, and so a relationship manager is not able to provide the same level of advice for many different clients. So we have specialized our relationship managers. And the second thing is that we have also worked a lot on the format of our branches because the branch, with a unique format covering all segments, is no longer the target. So we are doing a lot for the professionals, for example, in Societe Generale, the goal is to have approximately 150 dedicated spaces, corner or branches for the professionals, and we have also -- we are also creating 30 business centers dedicated to cooperate our clients. And this is also one of the big impacts of the digitalization because, without the tools we have mentioned, we would not have been able to do that at this pace. Impact on our back offices, here, the most important impact, of course, is the automation, front to back automation of the client journeys. So as you know, we have communicated on that on the Investor Day. And our target is to close 6 of our 20 back offices, the target was by 2020. It's done, more or less, so which means that we have done that with 18 months in advance. Simultaneously, we have also specialized these back offices. Again, we have the same idea to provide added value to the client and also to increase our internal efficiencies. So our back offices are specialized, whether on individuals or on corporates. And we have also created specific expertise in some of them on very complex products, specific mortgages or successions. And the last impact, it's the impact on our call centers. Two years ago, most of the task was taking care of the incoming calls. Now they are also more proactive, thanks to the digital tools we have mentioned. And for the most standard products, they are contributing up to 10% of the global sales.</p><p>So to conclude, and before answering your questions, in a few words, so we are totally focused on our execution plan to change the bank. We are on track. We are monitoring this very closely with many KPIs. 2020 is a key step for us, as Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric mentioned. We deliver a bank more flexible, more agile, but we know that is not the end of the journey. And this new platform we are creating is going to be also key for the future at least on 2 topics. The first one is that we will be able to easily integrate upcoming challenges such as Internet of Things world or virtual agents. The second thing we'll also be able to integrate is the new open banking world because, with this platform, much more flexible, we are able to integrate new products and services provided by third-parties and to sell them to our clients, and so to increase our revenues and, notably, our fee-based revenues. And conversely, with this new platform, we're also able to provide some assets to partners, which will integrate them in their own platforms. I have mentioned Franfinance, I have mentioned Transactis, and Claire will also explain what we intend to do with Treezor, which is our last acquisition, which is very specialized on the banking-as-a-service platform and, more especially, on the core banking-as-a-service. So this is one of our next frontier to develop the B2B2C business. So that's why we wanted to share with you this morning with Bruno. And now, we will be very happy to answer your questions. There are already some questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE LAMBERT, SVP AND UNITED KINGDOM ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jean-Pierre Lambert from KBW. I had a question about the trend towards intelligent banking. We're going to have more and more data growing exponentially. The analytics are getting more and more sophisticated, developing very rapidly. You spoke about BlueBox. How do you see the spread of AI in your analytics? And is it centralized? Is it decentralized by business units? And how do you see the development in that frontier?</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: For us, it's very important to have use cases. So we need to start from a business need. So yes, we have centralized capacity, and Christophe will mention that later. But the development of all these new technologies, we want to have them very grounded in the business reality. So it's a kind of mixed approach for the time being. Maybe it's going to change in the future. For example, for now, we have many use cases regarding compliance issues. So it's not directly generating revenues that is very important because that's part of the cost of doing business. And we see that for many topics, including KYC, including anti-money laundering. Artificial intelligence is helping us to act at a different scale and very, very more quicker. So yes, it's a kind of joint approach. But it's very important, yes, to have a global approach because we want to share, as I mentioned, resources, we want to share capacity, but simultaneously, we should continue to start with a business need and a business or support function, like that.</p><p>GUILLAUME TIBERGHIEN, HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN BANKS TEAM &amp; ANALYST OF BANKS, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Guillaume Tiberghien, Exane. The question relates to the presentation you made earlier. Obviously, very interesting, but I don't know yet whether it seems necessary to change like this to survive or whether you're ahead of the curve versus competition? It's not very clear to me. And I guess, my question would be, do you think your transformation will help cut your costs or accelerate your revenue growth?</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: So I strongly believe that it's mandatory. We thought doing that we will be and we would be already in trouble. Just taking the example of front offices, without this new approach of front-to-back processes, without this new approach of client journeys, we would not have been able to do this consolidation and to prepare for the next step which are part of our ID trajectory. Regarding the impact of all of that, yes, there is definitely an impact on the cost, I've just mentioned it, but also an impact on revenues. My last example, when I was saying that we will be able to integrate more products and services from outside partners in our platforms, it's definitely going to increase the intensity of the relationship with the clients and, yes, to provide additional services, maybe, in some cases, for free, but we hope, most of the time, to generate additional fees. We think that, in many topics we have mentioned here, we are, at least in France, ahead of the curve. For example, for the app, it's definitely the best in France, and even better than the app of the new banks.</p><p>JEAN-FRANCOIS NEUEZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Jean-Francois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. I just wanted to ask, so, in the demonstration that we saw, for example, there was the car insurance application. Just wanted to know, since that was introduced, have you seen -- what have you seen in terms of market share? Has it been efficient? Is this something which is bearing fruit, to take the examples that you, yourself, showed? And my second question would be, can you reproduce this growth, for example, say, in [commercial] at marginal cost? Or every country is really a silo when it comes to your IT platform? I understand it's not really France, but I guess, I am sure you must have a view on that. And thirdly, how can we explain that a bank like Boursorama, with close to 2 million clients, at least from the last data that we see, is not very profitable? Whereas, you see things which are quite similar, in a sense, like, say, Fineco in Italy, making some very, very different returns. What's the catalyst for this to change within the structure of the market?</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: So I start with the first question. In the case of insurance, it's too early to have a really quantitative evidence. What we have seen, and that is the numbers I've mentioned, that, yes, clients do like the new functionalities added on the app. So for some of them, they are using them very quickly. For others, it takes more time. But at the end of the day and because we are doing a lot of tests before, I mean, they do like them. So yes, it does some impact. It's step-by-step. Regarding the second question, I mean, yes, there have been different road maps in France, abroad. But we are more and more coordinating them, Didier will tell you what is going on, on the -- in international banking. Again, from an architectural standpoint, we have a centralized unit, which is monitored by Christophe. So we are sharing all these kind of tools, the best experiences. So we do not have yet a global, centralized monitoring of all of that. But definitely, the best example probably is Africa because in Africa, for example, there is definitely one single view. So we are -- basically, we have the same road maps everywhere, which is leveraging core banking systems because they are strong, they are robust, they are efficient and adding bricks. And the last comment, regarding Boursorama, for us, the priority, as of today, is to acquire clients. And the second priority is to making sure that the clients are buying products of Boursorama and generating revenues. This is the case. And you know that, for the time being, the commercial spending in Boursorama is important. If we adjust even slightly this commercial spending, which is taken upfront, Boursorama is profitable. So we have absolutely no doubt of the key component in our business model of Boursorama for the future. It's key for us. We do consider that the fact to be the market leader in France with 30% of market share, 30% of market share in acquisition is absolutely key for the future. And again Boursorama, with a slight adjustment of the marketing expenses, is profitable.</p><p>OLIVIER PANIS, VP &amp; SENIOR CREDIT OFFICER, MOODY'S CORPORATION, RESEARCH DIVISION: Olivier Panis from Moody's. I think one of your added-value as a bank is trust. So hopefully, your customers trust you more with data than they trust Facebook, for example. So here, how do you develop your open banking with the guarantee that the data of the customers are kept safe by the bank? And the second aspect is, do you think, at this stage, there are a lot of regulatory barriers to the development of open banking for the same reasons?</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: Well, I will start by the second part of the question. I think we have enough room of maneuver to continue to develop the business. Regarding data secrecy or managing the data, step one is, of course, we are fully compliant with the regulation. It's a no-brainer. Second step, we have internal security and compliance team which are very careful about all of that. And third, we ask the consent of the clients. And what is very important is, when you ask the consent of a client, you have to explain him or her what is the added-value. And once you explain the added-value, for client it's free, and he says yes to -- yes or no. But we can see that, most of the time, when we explain it clearly that with this usage of data, we will be more precise, we will be more efficient. And that at the end of the day, it's good for him, he is fine. And if he is not fine, we are fine.</p><p>JACQUES-HENRI MICHEL GAULARD, HEAD OF BANKS SECTOR RESEARCH, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jacques-Henri Gaulard, Kepler Cheuvreux. I wanted to come back on the demo because it's great. In the good old days, you could ask your adviser for an overdraft, now you can ask your phone. And on the risk basis...</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: You can ask your relationship manager.</p><p>JACQUES-HENRI MICHEL GAULARD: I was wondering how the risk function was actually working in terms of authorization, at which point you get to a risk committee, and just a little bit for you to get us into the kitchen secret of that.</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: So on the kitchen, of course, risk is involved from the beginning in this kind of project. It's fully embedded. We have governance with risk committees. We have governance with new products committees, because it's not only risk, it's compliance, it's legal, it's IT security. There are many components. In the case of, I have mentioned for Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit du Nord, which is very interesting, is that the credit scoring is embedded in the process, and it's asked through an API process. So in the process, at some point, you have an API requesting the credit score and, according to the credit score, we will activate the proposal to the client or not. So there is full consistency in this example between the credit process, as usual, and this new marketing approach.</p><p>AURELIA SIGRID SARAH FAURE, EQUITY ANALYST, GRUPO SANTANDER, RESEARCH DIVISION: Aurelia Faure, Santander. Could you give a quantification of your IT costs within your total cost? And also, the IT development cost as opposed to the IT maintenance cost because, at present, we don't really have any detailed splits on this topic.</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: If you could be patient, Christophe is going to provide you, within an hour, all this data. And if you want more, we can interact after, but that's within Christophe's presentation. So it's coming soon.</p><p>STEFAN-MICHAEL STALMANN, PARTNER, SWISS AND FRENCH BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous. I would like to come back to the Boursorama economics. It seems to me as if Boursorama, so far, has signed up a lot of clients but, in a way, the wrong clients, in that they're not very productive yet. They don't have a lot of loans on average. They don't have a lot of deposits on average compared to normal average French clients. Maybe they're buying less insurance products, et cetera. How do you think that is going to evolve over time? Do you think you can lift these clients to average productivity metrics? Or is there a point when you start actually attracting fully productive clients from other networks, so the mature clients with big loan books and big portfolios of the securities to manage, et cetera? And then when do you think that will happen? When do you think you will take market share from these fully productive clients, let's say, from the mutual networks based on your technology advantage, if there is one?</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: So first, it's important to mention that Boursorama has been profitable from the beginning, from its creation to 2015. And so we are in an investment phase. This is year #3. And so let's be clear with that. Actually, the clients of Boursorama are profitable. And we are managing very precisely according to the -- coming to the year of acquisition. All the clients behave, if they are subscribing new products, and we see very similar numbers compared to the mature networks. So the numbers of products, it's more limited. Bruno was mentioning that, in Societe Generale, we have 400 products. In Boursorama, we have only 40. But 40 with a very efficient operating platform behind. And again, as I said, the clients of Boursorama are not only doing payments or day-to-day banking, they are buying, as I said, insurance, savings accounts, all these kind of things. And the last thing I wanted to mention and come back, I forget. What was the last part of your question, sorry?</p><p>STEFAN-MICHAEL STALMANN: When you start to see market share gains in this kind...</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: No, I mean, what is key in the acquisition is that, by definition, Boursorama is acquiring clients which are, well, autonomous. So if our clients are not -- if they are not comfortable with the digital experience, I mean, they cannot be clients of Boursorama. So by definition, these clients should be autonomous and comfortable with that. If you need an interaction with a human being, I mean, Boursorama is not the solution. And regarding the market share, as I've told you, acquisition of core clients for Boursorama is one of our core priorities, and we're 1 year ahead of schedule. Again, we communicated on the Investor Day, 2 million clients by 2020, and this number will be achieved by the end of next year.</p><p>LAURIE MAYERS, ASSOCIATE MD, MOODY'S CORPORATION, RESEARCH DIVISION: Laurie Mayers from Moody's. In terms of your strategy, can you just comment on the extent to which you're -- particularly for Societe Generale and Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit du Nord, focused on client retention versus client acquisition? And despite everything you're doing that you've taken us through, in what areas, in particular, are you more concerned about disruption from either big tech or other new entrants in the retail space?</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: Okay, first reminder...</p><p>FR\u00c3\u00a9D\u00c3\u00a9RIC OUD\u00c3\u00a9A: Actually, this will be the last question because we have to go to...</p><p>DELPHINE GARCIN-MEUNIER, HEAD OF IR AND FINANCIAL COMMUNICATION, SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9N\u00c3\u00a9RALE SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 ANONYME: We will have a final Q&amp;A session if you have more questions so.</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: Okay. The first thing, and maybe I have not mentioned it clearly enough, is that keep in mind that, for Societe Generale and Boursorama, and in case of Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit du Nord, it's even more, 50% of the revenues generated by corporates and professionals. So we speak a lot about individuals. But the foundation of the revenues are also very important on the corporates and on professionals. We are not focusing more on retention than acquisition. What we are doing is, for both banks, making sure that we are acquiring target core clients. And for example, we have been, yes, more selective than other competitors for mortgages because, as you know, the interest rates for mortgages are very low. So it's an important amount of money dedicated to these kind of acquisitions. So we want to make sure that we are spending this -- I mean, we are doing this effort for core clients. Level of disruptions, I mean, yes, it's -- I would say, it's already done for the individuals, but it's coming very fast on the 2 of our markets. As long as retail banking is concerned, as Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric said, this is different on the pure investment banking. And we are not considering that nothing will happen on -- I mean, on professional, it's already there, also. So we are very careful, and we want to make sure that we are ahead of the pack. Okay? So now I leave the floor to Didier, which she is going to tell you the road map for International Retail Banking and financial services, and to introduce 4 workshops we are going to have in some minutes. Maybe we can show the movie again?</p><p>DIDIER HAUGUEL, GROUP COUNTRY HEAD OF RUSSIA, SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9N\u00c3\u00a9RALE SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 ANONYME: Thank you, Philippe. Hello, everyone, I'm very happy to be with you this morning. I'm going be here on behalf of all my colleagues from the international banking and financial services businesses to talk about our digital transformation, and I'd rather say our digital transformations. As you know, we are very diverse. And we are very diverse not only in terms of business models and location but also in terms of maturity of digitalization. Nevertheless, we have embraced the digital transition, and we have done it with 3 credos. First is convergence. Whatever the starting point, whatever is the level of initial digitalization, all businesses in banking are [met] to converge to the same model around digital, not necessarily at the same pace, not necessarily along the same way but all towards the same direction. Second credo, growth. Digital, it's a huge opportunity to develop our customer base. Third credo, decentralization. Yes, of course, the investment has to be monitored. Yes, of course, we have to share expertise. Yes, of course, we have to replicate solutions. But in the same time, above all, it has to be decentralized, implemented in a very decentralized fashion to make sure that solutions are relevant to all our core business models. So -- and you said this morning, this approach obviously tackles the customer interface. But what matters is to change the customer interface is what's going on in the kitchen, as you said earlier, and because customer interface is only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, it proceeds from an in-depth revolution of our entire value chain. Let's take them briefly step-by-step.</p><p>Process digitalization. It's about streamlining end-to-end the processes. That's what we're doing, for instance, in Russia to build our SG Russia digital store. And this streamlining combines automatization, better controls and a substantial reduction of the time to yes. So you will have an illustration, a demo, of a Russia housing ecosystem.</p><p>Second step, API-ization of our information system. We've launched across the board in all our locations an extensive reorganization of the systems. And that's a prerequisite to operate in an open architecture. And you will have an example of that with Moonshot. Moonshot is an internal start-up, and Moonshot has been developed by SG Insurance to be able -- relying on the architecture that is 100% APIs, to be able to develop with partners some pocket insurance products.</p><p>Third step, Big Data. It's about combining internal and external data to get a 360 view of the client, and then to process it through artificial intelligence mechanisms. So yes, it's a way to get more business, but more surprisingly, it's something that our most advanced retail debt collection platform in Germany, in Russia use and it changed -- it has a huge impact on the cost of risk because of more efficiency on collection and because of improved recovery rates.</p><p>Fourth, new products. Digital is not only about making some existing products digital, it's about inventing products that would not have existed without digital. And I think that you will have an illustration from that with what's going on within ALD, and they have numerous outputs from corporate car sharing to online second leases for individuals.</p><p>The next step is even new business models. A new business model is when you tackle a new segment of clients and you do that with a brand-new infrastructure. And that's what we're doing in Africa. And in Africa, with YUP, we are providing basic banking services out of partner shops, groceries, gas stations, and you will have a demo about what YUP is about.</p><p>Next element, the new ways of working, and Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric mentioned that earlier about agile. I think that it's about breaking the silos. It's about allocating our staff in the like tribes, i.e. multidisciplinary teams that are going to be focused on one very precise, short-term project, and we're going to get feedback from the clients. And it's a great way to increase customer relevance and to obtain fast delivery of projects. And the best example of that, that we have is in the Czech Republic, where we have engaged agile as a scaled kind of transformation. And already, 25% of the staff of the headquarters of Komercn\u00c3\u00ad Banka are organized and working into tribes. And it's bearing quickly some fruits.</p><p>So I would like to have you go back with 2 takeaways from this introduction. First, the digital transformation is (inaudible) within IBFS in a massive effort. It's not necessarily at the same pace, it's not necessary the same mix of solution because IBFS is diverse, but it's taking place everywhere. And just as a summary of that, the share of us change the bank within our IT cost, in the last 4 years, changed from 35% to 43%. Second, the names of the game are growth and efficiency. And this investment to change the bank focused on client satisfaction and our initiative to transform ourselves, they are paying off. And in the last 4 years, also, it allowed IBFS to steadily increase its customer base, plus 6%, and to sharply decrease its branch network, minus 11%. So now let's go to a concrete example with the demos downstairs. There will be 4 standing demos upstairs. As I said, housing ecosystem in Russia, Moonshot for insurance, ALD and YUP. Thank you very much.</p><p>ALAIN FISCHER, CHIEF DIGITAL OFFICER, SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9N\u00c3\u00a9RALE SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 ANONYME: Good morning, everyone. In our division, we all think about digitalization every single day. We all talk about digitalization every single day. But when faced with reality, how do we deliver. How do we deliver an incredible user experience, reduce our costs, become agile and innovative? How do we translate our promises into reality? Today, I'm going to share a journey that started in 2014 with a unique objective, make our clients', staff, partners' life easier and more efficient at work.</p><p>We are -- in 2014, we delivered a quality service, but it is not scalable. Most of our interactions between clients and bankers are slow and manual. Our juniors or seniors prepare pieces of advice, reports, analytics, answers to [NFPs, NFQs, NFS] through a lot of manual tasks. Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, Bloomberg Chat, phone, are our daily main tools. Information flows from one person to another with the risk of being different and outdated. And when this is done, we have another set of manual tasks through our controls but also the ones from regulators.</p><p>But this is not what we have at home. We've got mobile with a lot of apps, very efficient. We are autonomous, and we love it. So in 2014, we imagined the future of our interactions between clients and bankers into an ecosystem represented by this virtual circle. Everything is interconnected. The same intelligence is used between us and our clients. Ideas are fast to emerge and implement. So we set and communicated a clear ambition. We want to be a single marketplace for all our B2B services within our division for all client segments, large corporate, and all FI, and also for all our services, market services, finances services, security services and also cash management services. In 2014, we already had all our research analytics developed with an API-first strategy. We were well prepared technically, and thought that building a platform would be a rather technical challenge. But we quickly realized that the real complexity was not technology itself but how we apply it. So we established 3 key principles that have been key to our success.</p><p>The first one is stay focused. We are business-driven, not technology-driven. We have a lot of fantastic tools around us, but they will not bring a digital transformation by their own. They have to be connected to the entire setup within the bank. And this setup, we have to fix it, we have to transform it, we have to make it agile. The second principle is the use case. We test and stress any idea before we write a line of code. And the third principle is be patient. We know where we are going, we have the vision, we do it step-by-step. If we do everything at the same time, at the end of the day, we will do nothing.</p><p>How did we do? We want to be in the race against GAFAs and start-ups in financial services. So we have to act like them. But also capitalize on 2 fantastic assets they do not have. The first one is our network of people with their specific expertise. The second one is our data or processes or intelligence. Let's call it our legacy. Unfortunately, this fantastic asset is trapped under thousands of monolithic applications. The legacy or [gold], we have to transform it. Traditional strategy would attempt to create new systems and replace the old one by a new system. It's a multiyear project. The cost is huge. And at the end of the day, you have another legacy system. Another traditional strategy is to converge systems. You take piece 1 of system 1, piece 2 of system 2, et cetera, and you try to merge them. A multiyear project, huge cost, and at the end of the day, you have more a Frankenstein system than a digital system. So how did we do? We chose, in fact, to capitalize on our existing analytics platform and make it grow step-by-step. This was the first part of the strategy. And the second part is to break down our legacy into much more smaller tasks and transform it, deconstruct it step-by-step.</p><p>In a race, the overall winner is not always the fastest one. Often, it's the competitor who is able to take the turns the best and continuously adapt to the condition of the course of the race. And as you know, in return, there is, first, a slowdown and, after, a strong acceleration. So our challenges, our terms are to make the best of our monolithic applications by moving but also improving them into our SG markets platform. For each move into the platform, we take the time needed to align our legacy system with our core principles.</p><p>Now everyone needs to understand what I'm going to say even if it's a little bit technical, all our business people included. We, first, start to de-correlate the user interface. It has to be a next (inaudible) user interface totally independent from all the business logic behind. The user interface is what the users see. It's the tip of the iceberg. As you all know, for all icebergs, there is a strong invisible part. This invisible part is the business services. All business services will be done through APIs. These little pieces of code that interact with one another, Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric compared them to Lego, but that interact with one another and build a business service. And when you build these APIs, you have to see them altogether. The Lego, they all have same properties. The same for our APIs within our SG markets platform. This part is totally decorrelated from the user interface. No intelligence in the user interface.</p><p>And the third part is the data with all our legacy database that we will change progressively when we will have decorrelated everything in all our legacy between our user interface that we change every 3 to 5 years, then our APIs that we change continuously, let's say, in average, every 10 years, and the data that we change every 20 years.</p><p>So all the small pieces interact with one another, thanks to the first element. The core services, the Asia market's core services. This element is very important. It's the [spindle cell] of our strategy. I'm going to zoom on it. The first part is the security part. It's going to be more and more important in our approach, very important for our businesses. I'm not going to describe all the capacities behind this pillar. I'm just going to say that everything is done by design. It means, when you enter the platform, you are fully secured by the platform itself. No turns of extract after, through Excel, et cetera, to see what is not done in the right way on the platform. The second pillar is the user and developer experience. I would like to focus on 3 blocks that we are very proud of, the SG API catalog on SG markets. You can see everything that has been developed, it's open. Anyone in the bank can use it, even clients can use it, you will see it after. Our design system, which has been rewarded by the [unicorn] InVision. And our AI capacity, I will come onto it afterwards. The third pillar is the data, with the data lake. And the fourth pillar is the infrastructure, an important one. We want a lot of scalability into our platform.</p><p>The more red the color is, the more mature the capacity is. We still have some work to do on all these capacities. They are core. The governance behind all these capabilities is very simple. And even if they are all totally decorated from one another, they are seen as a family. There is a strategic core layer.</p><p>So now I'm going to switch to some demos. So I was supposed to do it online, but it's quite difficult so I've done some screen capture yesterday. So we start by you.</p><p>If you go on sgmarkets.com, you will see, in fact, the world offer. What we have today are market activity, financing, global transaction banking, securities. You can see it on your mobile, iPad or PC or Mac. Our design system allow us to have everything available on all platforms, coding, only one time.</p><p>Now I'm going to tell you the story of Florence. Florence, she is a treasurer within a corporate. So she connects, she knows that the system is very secure, thanks to the 2-factor identification, and she arrived on the platform. Florence, what she likes in the platform is that, previously, she had 9 different websites with 9 different account passwords, with 9 different user experiences. Here, she has a board of services where she can go anywhere from the platform. So this morning, she wants to see a position -- cash position, so she knows global cash. On global cash, she has a highlight at the top and she can see all her accounts in one way. So here, she sees that she has some cash on U.S. dollar, so she goes back through the interface on a wall of services and then she goes under foreign exchange project offer and then she executes a transfer from dollars to euros.</p><p>This is the journey of Florence on SG market, and she knows that is going to improve quarter-after-quarter through the services we are going to deliver onto the platform. Again, with the same user experience everywhere and the reuse of components.</p><p>So now you saw what is our strategy previously. You saw the offer on the execution -- Forex execution bot. This, in fact, thanks to the reuse, thanks to the approach we've just turned, we have reduced massively, of course, compared to the monolithic version we had created on Forex between 2009 and 2012. And what is important to have in mind is this the first version we did was for our staff, for the communication between salespeople and traders. We did it for ourselves and then we open it to corporates. But the story is not finished here because we have decorated everything. Because we have a very powerful business architecture, we created a version for John, who is a treasurer within an SME. In this version, you can see here the interface, the same design system and we just build a fountain on top of all the existing components developed through the previous version. The cost was really small and it took 6 months to deliver, and we are putting it in production just now. The story is not finished here because, as you know, we've got a corresponding banking business. And Kim works in a bank. And Kim, use, in fact, PayFix, so it's payfix.sgmarkets.com and, again, it's all the same elements that are used behind the interface. We all see the interface, but what is important is the fact that we decorate everything behind the interface and, again, everything is linked into the platform.</p><p>Now I'm going to take the example of Vladimir. Vladimir is an asset manager. When he connects on the platform, he has 10 different services, same story as Florence. He likes to have everything through the same user experience, the same thing as you have through your iPhone or through Microsoft or through Google, with the same user experience everywhere. So Vladimir, he likes notification path because everything is notified on the top line of the screen, everywhere in the platform, and it was the same for Florence and Forex and global cash. And Vladimir, he goes into analytics. Vladimir is a fund manager on the fixed income side. And Vladimir, he wants to do some relative value things through our analytics. So he goes into the chatting tool, and on the chatting tool, he is going to launch the funds [versus], which is Germany to see the correlation between French and German bonds. You can see here that there are some color codes, salespeople, engineers can prepare workbooks that they are going to share directly in the platform. Remember my first slide, no more e-mail, intelligence is directly done through the platform. And you can send links of workbooks to anyone within the bank or to other kinds. So Vladimir launched funds versus Germany. He has a very nice interface, he likes it. He sees a lot of things between the correlation of bonds. Now at the end of the day, he says, ah, it's a little bit painful to go every day on the same website to see the correlation of the bonds. And Vladimir, one of his colleagues, Morgana, she's an asset manager, also, but she's codes in Python, and she's a very good coder in Python. She's an asset -- she's a fund manager.</p><p>Vladimir is not a very good developer. He knows Excel, he knows VBA, but he doesn't know how to code. So Morgana told Vladimir, you should go into the API path of SG markets because, in fact, it's very simple and you can even use them through Excel. So Vladimir, he goes under the API path and then, again, he's not an expert, so he's trying it, he explores it and then he sees, in fact, try it out this API that to get all the information on the product we use. And then he sees the whole data. The API gives a whole data. No more duplication. So he says, wow, it would be cool if I could have this whole data directly in my Excel, it would avoid me to go every day onto the website. So he goes into the documentation, and he looks in API doc and on the API doc, we've got a VBA example. So under Excel, we've got also the code in our -- in Python, it's some examples to give to our clients.</p><p>So this is done through all our analytics. We have decorated the front-end from all the business logic, and this is available for our clients.</p><p>Now I'm going to show you the user experience for myself or anyone within Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. Remember, our strategy is everything we do for our clients or for our staff is exactly the same. So I connect into the platform. And what I like is that I can continue directly either under SG internal navigation or under client navigation. It's important to have this client navigation to see what is the offer given to clients today, because it improves week-after-week. So you can see this little red triangle, it means it's internal only. It's only for SG staff at the moment.</p><p>So I continue into internal navigation, and I see that on the market offer, I've got the equity derivatives flow with this red triangle. We are, in fact, doing some workflows -- automatic workflows between sales and traders. And for sure, in the future, one day, we'll be able to open this to clients immediately.</p><p>So I continue. I click on the board of services, this is my board of services. I have more than 120 services into this. This is the one I use the most, and I'm going to launch the one called (inaudible). You see that it's a red triangle here. The system gives me the services that I use the most.</p><p>I am going to show you a quick demo on the market chatbot through machine learning techniques. So one of our data scientists is -- has created an API that will be used in all our market activities that is able to pass any chat request that we receive on any asset class. You can see here, this is a client request and, in fact, machine learning technique is going to pass this text and to transform it into structured information that will be passed through an API that will be used on all our execution tools.</p><p>So what I like also is a developer portal, where I can see, in fact, all the developments that are done within SG. We'll open some of it to our clients in the future and our innovation.sgmarkets.com service that allow me to follow all the use case that we push within GBIS.</p><p>So where do we stand? On the analytics path, it's 1 service. It's just an example of 1 service. We have multiplied by 2 our external user, 4,000 users now. Out of these 4,000 users, 377 use the APIs directly. So they do not use the interface directly. They use the APIs. They connect their intelligence to our intelligence, with 30 million codes this year and with 60 gigabytes of data downloaded per week.</p><p>After this is our indicators globally, the one that I follow, the time to market has been divided by 2, when we developed on SG markets, for some developments that's been divided by 3, 4 and even 5. The reuse of our design system has been multiplied by 100. In 2014, we had 2 different service. Now we've got more than 200. The scalability, the number of services available in the platform, it has multiplied by 15 in the past 4 years. And the [synergies], the services that our clients and us are using. Again, everything we do between client and staff is exactly the same.</p><p>So in the next 2 years, we will develop -- we will transform and improve a lot of legacy systems into this platform. I'm going to focus on 3 specific ones we are going to do, a more integrated client journey for large corporates. There are still some services that are missing into the platform and that will be very valuable for our corporate clients. Second one is the opening of our deal processing capabilities. So we will have deal processing that sgmarkets.com offer. And third one, our KYC. Last year, we have started all the remediation on kyc.sgmarkets.com. We test it internally, it's in production internally. All our remediations this year were done through this tool, and we will open it to clients at the end of next year.</p><p>Now I leave the floor to Frank.</p><p>FRANK DROUET, HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKETS, SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9N\u00c3\u00a9RALE SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 ANONYME: Thank you, Alain. Good morning, everyone. So I'm pleased to be with you today, I mean, to give you a few examples of what we are achieving in terms of a digital initiative in global markets activity.</p><p>First, I would say that technology is part of our DNA. If we have been able to build our derivatives franchise over the last 30 years, it's thanks to extensive usage of the computer. And the exponential growth of the CPU has enabled us, in the last 3 decades, to provide to our clients more and more sophisticated products, while at the same time managing more and more complex risks.</p><p>But it's true as well that, for the last decade, we have faced, like any of the banks, the great challenge of incorporating into our information system new functionalities due to the changes of regulation and also because we realized that some parameters were neglected before the crisis, like the parameter link, for example, to the liquidity risk. So all those functionalities, we have been first to include them, incorporate them into our information system very quickly in order to comply with the regulation or to adapt our models. And that's basically transform of information system is very complex.</p><p>And as Alain has mentioned earlier, the first task and the first challenge that we are facing is to simplify this information system. By separating those 3 parts, the first one, the screen or the interface user, the client experience. Second, is where, again, the value of our system is. It's all the pricing functions, all the risk management capabilities that we have, transforming them into APIs and also reducing the number of database in order to have the cleanest data possible for reusage. So all these, we will put on the SG market platform, the single platform for the wealth and banking activities. And this requires the strong cooperation between 3 actors. The first one is the business owner, the front officer, because he knows what the clients want. He has the vision of what kind of service we want to deliver to the client. The second one is the digital designer. He knows what kind of APIs are available. He makes sure that all the developments are rational and that we are reusing all the APIs, which has been developed. And the third participant of this trio is the IT developer, of course, that has to develop the service in due time. I think, it's very important that these 3 people, these 3 actors are working very strongly together. And it requires, as well, a same common understanding of the technologies that are available to them. And I think, at Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, we have, on the front office, a population which is able to understand the new technologies and, therefore, we are also making a strong effort in terms of recruitment of young talent having some technology experience.</p><p>So a few examples of -- a few indicators of our SG Markets platform. So you can see that the number of visitors has increased significantly over the last 4 years, more than double. But maybe more importantly is the number of pricing requests that is occurring on our platform, SG Markets. And you can see on the structured product side, it's more than -- it has increased by 10x over the last 4 years. Now it's 600,000 pricing requests which are done on a yearly basis. And we will see that it's saving a lot of time for us.</p><p>So now, I would like to give you 2 examples. The first one is on structured products. Obviously, it's one of our franchises, and it's on the pricing of one product, which is becoming the most famous product in the distribution of structured products, which is the Autocall. I think, we talked about it in February. And here you have the screen of a standard Autocall that the client can directly input the underlying what kind of maturity he is looking at and all the different parameters that he's requested. And again, he gets the price of [2.95].</p><p>We have also the function or the advisory function to provide him as well as some advice on the -- if we can potentially change the underlying, extend the maturity of the product in order to get a better yield. But that, I would say, is relatively common for all the banks having a franchise in structured products, especially on the distribution side. What is more unique is your capacity to provide, on the system or on the platform, ad hoc pricing matching the request of the client. So there is a first discussion which takes place between the financial engineers and the client describing what kind of payoff he wants to have. And the financial engineer is able to write a script in our internal financial programming language that we have developed 10 years ago. We are reusing the most valuable part of our system. He is able to write a script, is add up just a few lines in Python where the financial engineer will describe what kind of parameters the clients need to input in order to get the pricing. And when this script in LDP, in our language programming plus the one in Python, are ready, the client can right away start to price on the platform. Obviously, this is an innovation that we have developed 12 months ago, which is very appreciated, more than 500 new products, new versions and you see ATHENA FOREX is beautiful. So you see that the people have tried to find new -- to change a little bit the payoff. And they add the new IDs, the client, and more than 500 new payoffs has been created on the platform in order to service our client. And I think, it's more than 150,000 requests, pricing requests, which has been made using this functionality.</p><p>The second example I want to mention to you is on the commodity side, this time on the trading. So here you have a discussion, a chat, that is very common between a client and an investment bank. The difference is that the client, here, is discussing with a robot, a trading robot. This robot, we have been able to build it thanks to the usage of all the APIs that has been developed on our platform. And one of him -- one of them, as Alain has mentioned, was the passing recognition of the language of the request of the client.</p><p>So as the robot is still a junior trader, he will make sure that he has well understood what the client has requested. So did you mean buying one lot of copper? And after you have a regular discussion between the client and the sales or trader and, at one stage, the client is giving an order to the robot, and the robot, when the price matches the request of the client, is executing the transaction. And right away, the client will receive a confirmation from the robot with all the disclosure that MiFID II is requesting. And as well, the robot will send the instruction through an information system for the settlement. I think, what is important is that we are using Symphony for this robot. So Symphony, it's a platform which is commonly used by investment banks and the buy side. We were able to develop it because Symphony is an open architecture. And I think, it's very important that, for innovation, we have either open architecture or open source.</p><p>The advantage for the client is, first, using the same platform to chat with the sales because the sales can be a part of the communication, obviously. You can execute, also, on this platform and receive the confirmation. And it's not only for listed products, but the robot understands as well if it's an OTC request.</p><p>And as Symphony is available on tablet and smartphone, the client, if it's out of its office, can continue to chat and trade with the application and in direct with the robot. So this robot has been recognized as an innovation and we received a few articles in the press recently for this. Obviously, it started with commodities. We want to deploy it across the different asset classes, and we will do that. But again, it's required to have all the necessary APIs. Therefore, we have to continue to simplify and to transform all the functionalities that we have on other applications or asset classes in APIs.</p><p>So I think, with these 2 examples, it's relative short, but you can see that, at the same time, we're able to improve the user experience and also we are refocusing our front officer, who could be the sales, the financial engineer, the trader, toward more value-added functions, which is, first, improving the algos, giving more content to the client, focusing on the content or finding new innovation in term of an end product. And having -- spending less time in the pure, the basic execution or, like for the first example, spending a lot of time to give a lot of pricing tables to the client because the client is able to do it himself.</p><p>So overall, and as a conclusion, I will say that the journey has started. We see more and more requests from our people at the front office having plenty of ideas on the services that we can provide to the client, but we should never underestimate the time that it will take, again, to simplify our system and to make sure that we have the good reusage of the APIs.</p><p>But I'm very confident that we have the people, we have the talent, the experience, the willingness, I mean, to embrace these new technologies. And I'm pretty sure that we'll have more service to show you the next time. Okay. Thank you.</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: So now I think, with Alain, we'll take a few questions and after we'll leave the floor to Christophe.</p><p>JACQUES-HENRI MICHEL GAULARD: Jacques-Henri Gaulard, Kepler Cheuvreux. The structured product demo you showed was really interesting. It seems to lend itself very well, the platform, to that. So how much do you think of the pricing or even the transaction of that could be done this way going forward? And how much is it now? And by when? Because it seems like a natural development for you.</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: I would say, on the very standard Autocall, there is 20%, 25% of our transactions are made through the platform we are using. And I think, it's important to mention that, obviously, we are building our own platform, SG Markets. But client -- and the client is also the retail banks, the private banks, are developing their own platform. So, therefore, I think, in the future, what will be very important is to connect the different platforms between them. And for this, I think, because we have a team, which has been -- which was (inaudible) after Newedge, who have been really involved in the connectivity between the client and exchanges, et cetera, we have this experience. As we have -- but, I think, it's roughly 20%, 25% right now. We have still some clients who are still expecting to have a better price if they take their firm to have just a small improvement that will continue to happen until maybe they realize that it's the same price than what can be given by the robot.</p><p>PIERRE CHEDEVILLE, ANALYST, CM-CIC MARKET SOLUTIONS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Pierre Chedeville, CIC. I have one question regarding, I guess, that you use some shared platforms, for instance, on FX or things like that, like 360, for instance. And what is interesting in this platform, which makes the prices much lower actually in terms of margin, you don't earn a lot of money with cash FX today due to this -- the development of these shared platforms. But on the other hand, you get a lot of information from all the markets. For instance, before this type of platform, you only knew the transaction you made with the clients. Now you know all the transactions made by all the participants of the market, thanks to this shared platform. So my question is very simple. How do you use this enormous amount of data regarding activities of these clients given to you by this platform because I guess that they make you pay a fee to get access with all these amount of data. For instance, you can see that when companies exporting a lot to Mexico recently, so you can say, ah, there may be something to offer, et cetera, et cetera. Have you structured some things regarding the usage of this big data regarding shared platforms?</p><p>FRANK DROUET: Thank you. It's true that, I mean, we have more and more information about the transaction, which would be on the multi-dealer platform or with the regulation with MiFID II. We are obliged, I mean, to post on the -- all the information, all the transactions of the OTC that we have done. There is one caveat on this, is that the biggest transactions, you have more time to declare them. So the one who are moving and I think as well on some markets, which are highly [electronic-ized], that like 70% to 80% of the transaction are going through a multi-dealer platform, but the biggest transactions, the ones who are moving the markets, they are not on the platform, it's still on the voice. Because, I think, for confidentiality, because you think that if a big order is coming, for example, your client giving -- doing, I don't know, a big transaction in Mexico, most likely if you see that the big orders are traded on the screen that will move the market and maybe the bank has not enough time to hedge itself, so again the biggest transactions, and we have, sometime, up till 1 month to declare the transactions, even with MiFID II. So -- but yes, I mean, we are using more and more the data, the transaction and we are analyzing them. And it's, again, we will give more content to the client with this analysis. But for the moment, there is still some parts which are still undiscovered.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes. Just one question about security services and transaction banking, which we haven't really talked about too much. But from point of view of developing APIs, yourself and user interfaces and things, how much of this is about collaborating with other banks as compared to doing things on your own?</p><p>ALAIN FISCHER: Today, if you look at the bank, we've got plenty of services that we can mix up very easily when they are in the platform. So it's our strategy to put everything in the platform. But our platform is also open, which means that, if we want to link it -- you've seen it with Symphony, but if we want to link it with other services to more coming from cash management in some countries or on security services, it would be easy to do it. Today, it's not the top priority. Today the top priority to transform everything we have, all our gold, into something very agile and where we'll be able to mix different things within the bank very quickly.</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: Okay. Christophe. Thank you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC, GROUP HEAD OF CORPORATE RESOURCES &amp; DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9N\u00c3\u00a9RALE SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 ANONYME: Thank you. Hello, everyone. I hope that you enjoy the presentation and the booths this morning. Well, okay, it's time now to wrap up and to step back a little bit because I am going to speak about the overall digital strategy of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale.</p><p>Digital strategy is about technology and innovation. So I will start first to speak about technology, and then Claire Calmejane, our new Chief Innovation Officer, will, obviously, speak about innovation. So but let me introduce myself before. So I am Christophe Leblanc. I am the Head of the Resource and the Digital Transformation Department in Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. I speak on behalf of the IT Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale community here.</p><p>So what is the objective of my presentation today, it's to evidence that the digital strategy that we have is helping Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale to transform to gold, which is our key motto for 2020, as mentioned by Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric Oud\u00c3\u00a9a during the Investor Day last year.</p><p>Yes. Indeed, the digital transformation is first grounded. This morning, you saw all the businesses, all their strategies are completely link dependent on digital, so it's grounded. The second thing is, it is responsive. Last year in front of you, we committed on certain, I will say, targets in terms of technology, and I am going to demonstrate that we are well on track to achieve those targets.</p><p>Starting, if you want to succeed in digital, you need to be obsessed with quality. What I mean there is that safety, IT security are key in our transformation. Also the production stability is key. So we need to be obsessed with quality.</p><p>And lastly, as I consider and we consider technology as an asset, as a key asset of the group, we need also to be watchful, which means that we need to take care of it, be it on technology, like servers, applications but also people. So you will ask me now, where do we stand in terms of digital transformation? Last year, okay, we committed -- yes okay, one thing that I want to say before I go there. Is that when I say grounded, it's not only for the business. Actually, the full firm of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale is following a digital transformation. Risk, compliance, audit, finance, have their own digital strategy. Recently, I attended a demonstration of a tool, which is called [on-stack] KYC. And it enables, thanks to image recognition on IDs, to complete the file of the retail customer. It's an important milestone for our regulators, and we have, with this tool, a capacity by months to remedy 75,000 files per month. It's huge, it's huge productivity as well.</p><p>In audit, the audit techniques have completely changed, thanks to technology. So you see it's grounded in the full company. Now in terms of -- where do we stand in terms of targets on the digital transformation?</p><p>Recently, you saw maybe that we won the eCAC40 award. This is great. I'm very proud of this for the team. But also what is important for me is the consistency of our ranking, which shows that our digital transformation is on the long run as well, is really a long effort. It is based on 3 key enablers: data and artificial intelligence, open platform and cloud. Why do we choose these enablers? Data is key, is a key asset of the group and it enables you to create new services, it enables you, as well, to improve the customer journey.</p><p>Open platform is about APIs, is about also creation of new services and also about efficiency for our developers.</p><p>Lastly, cloud is the foundation. Cloud is about scalability, is about resiliency and also it's developer friendly and it's cheaper as well.</p><p>So where do we stand exactly on data? We have 2 main data lakes, and on these data lakes, we are building, I will say, our use cases. Last year, we were roughly at 50 use cases in production. Today, we are, I will say, more than 80 production use cases -- use cases in production and we have a target, okay. We have roughly on the pipe -- in the pipe, 246 potential use cases to be put in production. So we're well on our target to get -- reach to these 200 numbers by 2020.</p><p>So we are able to multiply our sales use cases. And on the top of that, what is key and important focus for me is to make sure that we have the right data quality in our data lakes. And at the same time, that we extend the perimeter of these data lakes. This is what we are currently doing.</p><p>One hot topic for the banks is obviously artificial intelligence. There, there is 3 type of things that we are doing: predictive analysis, and you heard, this morning, Philippe speaking about Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit du Nord, the BlueBox tool, which enables, okay -- which is based on machine learning on data which is either internal or external data, which helps the commercial effort of Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit du Nord.</p><p>We can do also things around operational efficiency. Recently, I had a demonstration of a tool in compliance, which enables to screen all the articles in the press on one client. Thanks to that. We're able, obviously, to see if there are any negative news and, therefore, okay, achieve one important regulatory constraint that we have on our client bases.</p><p>We are working as well on virtualization. You remember that Philippe mentioned the partnership that we have with Google Home, but we are going to implement soon as well in the French retail the SoBot tool, which is sort of chat box for younger clients in order to interact and do simple transactions. So you see we are well on track on data and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Now if I move to open platform, Alain and Bruno, this morning, mentioned the importance of the APIs. The fact that the APIs are enabling you to modularize your legacy system. This is key. What is my goal here is to make sure that we are sharing all the APIs. This is why we are implementing and we are implementing and we are deploying a catalog of API within Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. The catalog of API is not an Excel spreadsheet with a list of API. It has to -- it is about norms, standardization. The APIs which are exposed in this catalog have to fulfill certain norms in terms of security and monitoring. Today, we are roughly exposing 1,500 APIs in this catalog.</p><p>Lastly, on cloud. Cloud, again, is the foundation. We have an (inaudible) cloud strategy. We want to move 80% of our infrastructure to cloud by 2020. We are well on track, we're at 60%. And we have the partnerships with big cloud providers in order to do also public cloud, and the share of the public cloud by 2020 should be around 20%.</p><p>With all these efforts that we are putting on infrastructure, we are able to save and we will save, by 2020, EUR 100 million per year. So we are well on track.</p><p>And I must say, you will ask me certainly, how do we compare to others? We did a study with Gartner. They say -- they tell us that, on the cloud, so far that you have this strategy, this (inaudible) cloud strategy is certainly a differentiating factor compared to your competitors. I believe as well that the fact that we have this catalog of APIs, which is a common, okay, I would say, asset for all the developers of the group is certainly, as well, a differentiating factor. So digital transformation is well on track in Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale.</p><p>Now, okay, it's no use to do digital transformation if you are not working in a safe environment. Safety is key. And what does it mean exactly, safe? First, for me, it means that, okay, the production is stable, the active production is stable. Second, that we fight, obviously, against cybercrime. And lastly, that we embrace a holistic view of the IT risk.</p><p>On the production side, in Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, in 1 month, we process roughly [60 millions] of connectivity in the French Retail network on our e-banking. One day, in January 2018, we had to cope with [128 millions] of orders. So you can imagine with this size of volumes, that incidents may occur. So we have to follow them. We have to solve them, obviously. But what is key for me is to recover and the time to -- we take to recover from this incident. I can tell you that now we are able to recover 50% of our incidents in less than 2 halves. This is a huge achievement. And there, we can be also innovative. We have implemented recently a predictive maintenance tool, which enables to predict, thanks to the analysis of the logs of the engines and incidents. And in October, we were able to detect 6 potential incidents on the Swiss platform and the French Retail e-banking platforms.</p><p>Now, okay, last year, we said we are going to invest a lot in cybersecurity, EUR 650 million over 3 years. We are well on track on this investment, on these efforts. This is a long-term effort. But there, again, the capacity to recover is key. This is why the teams are training themselves in terms of simulation if part of the system were down, if our PCs were down, if our active directories were down. How do we react? This is -- so this is really what we are pushing in our IT teams to make sure that we have this capacity of reaction, if we were attacked by a hacker.</p><p>Lastly, I must say that IT risk is not only about only cybercrime. IT risk is also -- can be also project risk, if there is a bug in some things that we are implementing, your production can fall. It's also about obsolescence. This is why you have to really have a holistic view of your IT risk. This is what we are pushing with all the CIOs of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, and we have a sort of dashboard of IT risk management that we follow closely.</p><p>So now -- so you see we are all obsessed with quality. Now I must say that my conviction is that technology is an asset. And there we have to be watchful. We invest in the technology each year, roughly EUR 4 billion. It's roughly 23% of our operating expense. Out of this EUR 4 billion, I must say that EUR 1.8 billion is on what we call Change the Bank investment, new investment, new projects.</p><p>What is important is that, with the other CIOs that I -- we follow, obviously, the efficiency of this expense, that this EUR 4 billion are well spent. Let me illustrate this point. Recently, we implemented, okay, some key efficiency indicators, and I can tell you that, in the IT world of the retail banking, we have been able to increase by 40% the number of releases compared to last year.</p><p>In the wholesale side, we -- more than 50% of our applications have really -- are able to release in less than 4 weeks. So speed also matters. Obviously, we are also making sure that the Run-the-bank of the IT is well under control.</p><p>Lastly, I must say that technology is not only about, obviously, investment, it's about people. Today, in the IT affiliate of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, there are roughly 25,000 people. Because we are putting a lot of efforts in terms of contacts with the schools, the universities, organization of events, we are able to attract developers. Each year in France, we are recruiting 500 developers per year. And in India, just to give -- we have a setup, which is huge now. We have roughly 4,000 IT people in India, and this is obviously a key area of sourcings of talent for us.</p><p>Attractivity for the people means as well that we are able to retain the people. This is why, okay, we are pushing for agility. Remember last year, okay, we said to you, we are going to have this target of 50% of our teams in the IT world should work around agile mode. Today, we are 27%. We are experimenting as well agile-scale type of techniques, where the organization of the IT is really in sync with the organization of the business.</p><p>Attractivity for the developers goes also with open source. It was mentioned by Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric. So our motto is open source first, and we are doing open source in database, in middleware as well as in applications. The cloud is also developer-friendly, and we are investing a lot in training as well. So you know and we know that a large part of the jobs in the IT are going to change. We are going to have new type of jobs like scrum master, UX designer, and we need to prepare this population to these new jobs. So we are spending a lot of time, okay, in terms of organizing academies and also automated self-services type of training journeys.</p><p>So you see we are transforming the IT world today. But one key takeaway that I would like to remind of my introduction is my presentation is that the digital transformation is well on track, obviously, in Societe Generale; that it's key, and it's embedded in the business strategy. That we have differentiating factors, and I think the key differentiating factors that we push are around agility, cloud and open platform APIs.</p><p>Lastly, so you understand that the really digital transformation is a key enabler of the Transform To Grow strategy, but the second key enabler is obviously innovation. But for that subject, I will let the floor to Claire.</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE, GROUP CHIEF INNOVATION OFFICER, SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9N\u00c3\u00a9RALE SOCI\u00c3\u00a9T\u00c3\u00a9 ANONYME: Thank you, Christophe. Thanks, everyone. I would like to build a bit on what Christophe just mentioned about legacy, and I'm the newbie in the team here, obviously. And there is a tradition, when you join a rugby team, and you know that Societe Generale is quite big on rugby, you are given a jersey. And basically your job is to build the value on the jersey. It's to make this team stronger, it's to create some synergy, and that's the way I see my job as a business enabler of this transformation.</p><p>So Christophe has just covered how we -- the growth part of the plan. I'm going to cover how Societe Generale is becoming more open and connected by putting customers and colleagues at the center of our transformation. We are 1 year into our Transform To Grow plan, and a lot has happened already, and my job is to structure and accelerate it even further. And innovation and business transformation is something I've specialized on for the last 15 years.</p><p>So I'm going to cover, in the next 15 minutes, how we are bringing outside-in perspective to change the way we work and to create some organizational agility, how we are preparing for the future. Because even if there is a lot happening already, and we have seen that this morning, there is more to come. And we need to understand these new capabilities and build them within Societe Generale to keep the cost of the transformation low.</p><p>I'm going to talk to you about how we are partnering and preparing for our open banking -- open platform strategy and how do we tackle the partnership with the FinTechs and the technology giants. And last, I will cover how do we create new businesses. You've seen some of the kiosks this morning with YUP, with Moonshot, so I'm going to talk you about our plan about that.</p><p>I was mentioning about how we want to create some organizational agility. This morning, Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric talked about our cultural transformation. We're reimagining the way we work, and to do that, we are doing it in twofold. On one hand, we are leveraging the data and we are building on our entrepreneurial culture, which are 2 of our key assets, historic assets, we have in Societe Generale. And in the other one, we are getting inspiration from the startups and the technology giants to change and evolve our new ways of working. It's important for us, in this journey, to be inclusive and to focus on the impact. So let me give you a few examples about what we are doing.</p><p>First, we are working on our culture and skills, and Christophe gave some examples about IT, but we are doing that at the size of our organization, at the size of our 140,000 colleagues across 61 countries. We are running digital training programs, and we have more than 10 curriculums that exist in the group. I'll give you some figures about numbers of our training, which are very specific to 2 of them. And we are running innovation and technology weeks in more than 10 of our countries. And they are not just for our IT staff but they are for all colleagues of the organization. And there was actually one 10 days ago in the U.K. where there was not only colleagues from all areas of our businesses but also clients and startups coming together and sharing how our industry is evolving.</p><p>We're also transforming our workplace to stay efficient. We have a cloud-based environment, and more than 50% of our colleagues are already using it. And this environment is not just your laptop and how you can connect, but it's also you use it, for example, a virtual assistant that enable us to be scheduling meetings much more efficiently. We've got 19,000 people that are bringing their own device at work. And again, this results in cost efficiency for the organization but also a better workplace environment, we all know that. And 15,000 people are enrolled in our home office program, which is not only a sign of agility in our organization but also of innovation.</p><p>I was mentioning, we are getting inspiration about how the startups and technology giants are working. We've launched 1 year ago, at the beginning of the year, one of the largest entrepreneurship programs in the world. We engaged about 15,000 of our colleagues to push some ideas that became 60 startups. These startups, we have put them in our network of accelerators across the world to test and learn from new techniques that are coming from the startup world, such as human-centered design, lean startups, business model canvas. They are currently running through their acceleration. Some of them are coming at [months] plus 6. And we are already getting some learning that we are integrating in our organization.</p><p>But more importantly, that what I will talk about in a minute, which is a creation of internal ventures of new services and new products. What we have learned is to not fear to overcome our fear of failure, to say that it's okay that we are working on these investments and about 30% to 40% will become projects, new projects, new ventures, new products, and maybe about 10% of them will be capitalized and will be the YUP and the Moonshot of tomorrow. But actually what we learned through this program as well is what is the burden of our organization. What are currently the processes, the capabilities we need to change and to evolve in order to gain agility, to reach speed and to be even more efficient and faster than we are today.</p><p>And last, we are looking at the outside. We created a network of ecosystem builders that are leveraging 6 outposts so 6 different lab -- innovation labs across the world in Europe, in Asia, in the U.S. and in Africa. And they are continuously not only building partnership, watching their ecosystem, which is very relevant for our business synergies, but also bringing us some insight about the pace of change and what we can observe so we can be reactive as an organization.</p><p>So we are becoming faster and more efficient. Like rugby teams, as competition progresses, we have to progress under the way we see it. I was mentioning that we are also preparing for the world of tomorrow. I've talked to you about what we are doing in the entrepreneurship program, and we've tested and learning some of the human-centered design techniques. These are frameworks that result in using your processes and analyzing them in bits. Basically, you start from a human perspective about everything you do. And using them enables us to put colleagues and customers at the center of everything we do.</p><p>So what are we talking about? The skills and the capabilities, you may have heard of them: service design, system thinking, customer research labs. Did it ring a bell? But what is it enabling us to do concretely for the organization? It's enabling us to look at how our processes are working and where are the friction and the pain points of our customers, and Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric was talking about that this morning, and to allocate investments where they are, which is one of the key successes of the startups and technology giants as we have seen them.</p><p>It's enabled us to connect better with our customers. And last point, it enabled us to blueprint new value chain. We've talked a little bit about that with Didier this morning, but what do I mean? Yesterday, when you were buying your house, you were probably going to a branch, talking to a person and eventually when you're finish with a mortgage adviser and he will provide you the way to buy your house. Today, you're probably going online, maybe taking a picture or going in [indiscernible] in the U.K. And eventually, at one point, you are enter in contact with somebody in the financial services chain that provides you your mortgage. At the same time we are doing that today, there is a Google technology that can almost predict with AI which house you are going to buy even before you know it. And this understanding is very important. How do we do -- how do we buy tomorrow financial services as human? What are the point of contacts because this will enable us to really understand what are the future value chains and how we remain present in them.</p><p>And let me build on that because It's completely integrated in our open innovation strategy, open banking and open platforms to one. We want to be where our clients spend their digital lives. And we appreciate they don't only use our digital platform, but they also spend their time in Google, in WhatsApp, and maybe in a lot of other digital tools that are provided by different companies. And we want to be present where they are, and it's very important for us. We've talked a little bit this morning about open banking and the API economy. It's still very nascent. And what we observe is that, in the B2C segment, there is probably a journey to go, in the B2B we can see some revenues that are already coming. In the B2B2C, I will talk to that -- about that in a second with Treezor, but we can see that there is some revenues as well on this side. The way to think about it maybe is like the mobile that was introduced in 2007. Not so far ago, but look at the journey we've been on.</p><p>So that's why a priority is very important to develop an ecosystem and strategic partnership across the group. Obviously, it's [declined] locally by each of our businesses because they will better understand what is relevant for them, but we want to leverage the effort of the group to be present in this ecosystem so they can understand the program of our distribution network. And the way that we do that is with a very specific and differentiated strategy in 5 pillars.</p><p>The first one is around incubators and accelerators, where we're going to take that early, where is the talent and the product. And let me give you an example. I don't know if you followed, but we've recently announced a partnership with a company called Duco, which is a London-based data management firm, which is enabling us to do reconciliation much more faster than what we had before with spreadsheets and legacy systems. This company was detected through one of the early connections in one of our accelerators. We also have strong commercial partnerships at large scale. You visited ALD a bit earlier, this time with Jean and the team. They have recently signed a partnership with an American startup called Vinli. Vinli used to provide consumers directly the ability to connect their vehicle in the cloud and to access different mobile apps with it. Vinli is now providing kind of the App Store for ALD to push mobility apps and mobility services for all the different businesses of ALD. So that's one of the strong commercial partnerships about how do we go even further than where we are. How do we accelerate? And as you can see, we have several of them. We're also making some strategic partnerships with the technology giants. So we've been talking this morning about Google Home in our Boursorama brand. We've been talking about our cloud providers, and we obviously use Apple Pay as well.</p><p>And last, the part of how do we create new business? How do accelerate the disruptive scenarios and the high-growth strategy? And for that, we have made some investments. And you've been all in the kiosk of YUP this morning, which was with the TagPay. So we made an investment in this technology at the beginning, at the same time that they were developing YUP. There was a synergy between the business ambition to create something new and the capability of our group to invest in this technology and to better understand how it was evolving. And we're also making some full acquisitions. Philippe has talked about Fiduceo, which provide -- and Bruno as well, which provides aggregation capabilities across our brand in the French retail banks.</p><p>We also made Lumo this year. Lumo is one of the pioneers in France about crowdfunding in renewable energy, and it's directly hosted by the business that [Luc] addressed in Societe Generale. And last but not least, we've been referring to it a couple of times, I'm going to talk to you about Treezor. Treezor is a very interesting acquisition, and it's still under approval by the French regulator. Treezor is the leader in France to provide the core banking system for the FinTechs. So it provides API payment services, KYC and personal scouts, like you can see with the neobanks that send you a card in a couple of days to your home. The reason we made this acquisition was, for us, twofold. First, it's an opportunity to accelerate our open banking strategy in the retail sector, and we've talked about that this morning. Second, it's an opportunity to distribute some Societe Generale products in the ecosystem of these FinTechs. For Treezor, it was an opportunity to have a main partner that is able to help them to -- in a very competitive market, to upscale their technology products but also to develop [internationally], something that we have because we have the presence and the network across several countries where they want to expand. The reason why Treezor was interested to work with Societe Generale is because of our entrepreneurial culture and because of our direct access to senior management.</p><p>Just going to play a short video so you can see what it looks like.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE: So what I want to stress is, when we work our open innovation strategy, it's totally grounded into our open banking one and our open platform one. So for us, it's a real ambition at a group level to go towards that direction. And it's very important to find the right partners to build this future.</p><p>Last, how do we create new businesses? That's something that we have been working over the last 18 months. You have seen YUP in the kiosk, you have seen Moonshot as well. We have 2 other internal ventures that are currently -- that have set themselves up. So one is Peers, which is basically an investment network where you can get some tips about how to make -- best make your investment. And the other one is Peers -- Elyxir, sorry, which is a digital finance adviser, which is basically introducing a new relationship between clients and their savings. So that's something that you could have seen in the market, but the specificities there is that we build it internally as a startup. And so what we are looking is should it be an external venture, should it stay an internal venture under the way we make our decisions. We've been talking about Lumo and Treezor as well, which are our recent acquisitions.</p><p>So based on the work we've done over the last 18 months, we are now ready to accelerate, and that's why we are creating Societe Generale Ventures. Societe Generale Ventures is not only a corporate venture fund. We've been learning from what our peers have been doing, and it's there to support the Transform To Grow plan and the strategies of the different businesses. So it's a combination of the ability to do strategic investments with the business venturing out. And we are very structured, and we remain selective in the way we want to do this investment. So we have identified about 9 areas where we are prioritizing the investments in our core business and what we'll be looking for. And you can see in bold the ones that we were more scouting and more looking, which are payment and e-commerce, bank as a platform and SME. But we've also defined some prospective [axes], which are more looking in the future, more looking into what's next. And let me comment on them.</p><p>So the first one is mobility. We've been talking about ALD and their partnership with Vinli for example, how the mobility business is evolving. And we can see some synergies between the ALD business and insurance, for example, that have the same needs. So it's important to look transversely at the group level to create these synergies.</p><p>So the nexus is about identity and immersive experience. And we can see some technology giants like Facebook that are making massive investments into this space, into camera, into augmented reality but also, for example, the spinoff in Google called Magic Leap that have just launched their product in the market. It's very early days, so the question is how is it going to relate to the customer experience in our -- in the business of financial services? The third one is around data monetization and where these use cases are sometimes less developed in Europe, they are clearly developing in areas like Asia.</p><p>So we're looking at what's going on there. For example, with (inaudible) that had been in several products that are the data monetization base. Future of work, we've been talking about it. Our organization are evolving, and we are interested to always put and learn more about it. And last, [Aztec], with everything that go across our health and private banking and how this sphere and customers could evolve.</p><p>So that was, I hope, a good view about how we are becoming more open in the organization and more connected to our clients and also putting customers and colleagues at the center of everything we do. So we've been talking about open and grow, Christophe and I, explaining our digital strategy. We're part of the rugby team of Societe Generale, and I would like to thank you all for your time today.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>GUILLAUME TIBERGHIEN: Gillaume Tiberghien, Exane. I've got 4 questions. The first -- sorry, 3. The first one is about your EUR 4 billion of IT budget. I'd like to try and understand where you see that number maybe in 5 years. The second question is the EUR 4 billion accounts for 16% of the revenues at Societe Generale, and I'd like to understand if IT can help gain efficiency and maybe fall to 13% or maybe have your thoughts on -- in that respect. And the third question relates to SG Ventures. What sort of envelope or budget have you allocated? And what would be the impact on your capital?</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC: I will answer to the first 2 questions, okay? Yes. Okay. The question is difficult to project ourselves in 5 years for technology. Because if you come back to the slide, where, okay, I was showing, okay, the amount that we invest in Change the Bank, you will see that it has been growing especially, I would say, in the last 5 years, okay, because of the -- mainly because of the Change the Bank and the new investment, and where we invest a lot in the past, last year, is in, obviously, the retail banking transformation as well as the regulatory portfolio because it's -- the regulatory portfolio weights about 27% of our portfolio and type of investment. And if you go back 10 years ago, it was certainly too low, but it was less than 10% at that time. So now if you project yourself and just say, well, okay, what's going on in the future? I must say that there will be a reallocation. I do feel and I think that the regulatory burden will certainly be less. But when you think about the transformation and the fact that it's a long run, it was mentioned by all of us, okay, it's certainly to be reallocated to other types of subjects because technology is evolving very fast. I mentioned artificial intelligence. I think that the size of the investment that we'll have to do in artificial intelligence is going certainly to grow. So for me, my guess will be it's going certainly to be stable for a while before we can, okay, imagine a sort of decrease. Now okay, about the question about efficiency. I mentioned it. Okay, I think that my focus, my, today, focus and the CIO's focus within Societe Generale is really to make sure that we get the most value of this IT expense. And -- but we don't want necessary to say that we have to cap it because the transformation of the business, and it was mentioned a lot of times by the business people themselves, in terms of digital is really key, it's mandatory, okay? So our goal is to make sure that the productivity of the IT staff is really there. This is why, okay, I mentioned these indicators of efficiency. I know the number of (inaudible) permanent of Change the Bank. This is why I mentioned our setup in India, because I think that we are obsessed with this, I will say, efficiency. But in terms of amount, okay, it's really, for me, something in terms of percentage, maybe it's good to have maybe over this 16%. You see, I don't have necessarily an objective on this percentage. So maybe I'll let you comment on the SG Ventures, Claire.</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE: Sure. So we already announced the envelope of EUR 150 million last year, so SG Ventures is built on that. So there is no impact in the capital that was announced in the Transform To Grow plan. What we have observed and learned over the first investment is that, quickly, we see high a level of synergies with our business, and we are capable not to just hold them central yet at -- in the group or somewhere that truly has an impact. And you've seen YUP and Moonshot that are already on track to generate some breakeven. So that's something where we feel we've been learning and we feel we are ready for acceleration.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I just wanted to ask on the -- it's difficult for us to benchmark a bank versus another or -- but for example, in your opinion, when you monitor all the projects that you've been showing, all these metrics, et cetera, et cetera, in France, for example, where do you think you stand versus the, what, 5, 6 banks that are competing, broadly speaking, there? And importantly, also, do you think that the changing of customer access to their banking services, in particular in France, is something which will enable your regional rivals to get more into the city and into your client base or the reverse? Banks, which have a smaller network such as yourself, compared to the big mutuals to enter their network and win share?</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE: (inaudible) a question for you, Philippe. If you want me to rephrase it or?</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: There is a first part of the question (inaudible)</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE: (inaudible)</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: About the competition, about -- it's difficult, no? I agree with you. It's already difficult to compare yourselves. This is why, okay, I mentioned some -- what I think are differentiating factors compared to competitors in the digital strategy. I think that we are pushing more on the cloud. I think that we are recognized to have pushed a lot on agility. I think that our strategy on this APIs is certainly a differentiating factor as well compared to certain French competitors. And our sourcing on the IT talent, you see why I mentioned India, is certainly a differentiating factor for the French bank. So now okay, I must say then, okay, it's about -- at the end of the day, all the -- what you show you -- we show you in terms of illustration of what are the output for the customers where we are making the difference. So this is where, okay, you will see the vast difference. But I give you some areas where I feel there is a differentiation. So on the French retail -- on the -- maybe you want to respond, okay?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Unless you...</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: No, no, no.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I would tend to say, I don't know if it's going to answer perfectly your question, but I think we are becoming less and less dependent of our branches. We are building a platform with digital capacities, with -- including our back offices or call centers interacting with clients. We have relationship managers. We have -- who are themselves more and more mobile. I mean, they visit corporates, they visit professionals, they visit also colleague individuals. So the branches, which were the only assets in the past and which have performed very well, is becoming now a component within a holistic approach of our customers. And I think, on this concept, this view, we are ahead of the pack. I'm not even sure we are already thinking about maybe a part of our sales forces will not be only SG staff at some point. So that just to mention that I think we have -- it's already clear for us. We have already important breaks, obviously, on our approach.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Could you give us some examples of the areas of businesses or services where you have understood that, with the development of technology and the behavior of clients, they will not be profitable? So that they are clearly traps that you need to stop doing or other competitors that are not banks will clearly become the winners?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I mean, we are -- in order to answer your question, I would tend to say that we are really reducing our cost to serve on some businesses. So probably a very important area for that, it's payments. We discussed during the break with some of you. I mean, payments is definitely the way of entry for many competitors and to try to disintermediate relationship between us and the clients. It remains key for us. So we are continuing to invest. I think that. in France, we have already very strong assets, including the credit card, which is still a very good project. We have been able to change the way people are using the credit card. I do believe a lot in the instant payment, which is an interesting output of (inaudible). Instant payment, that's something that we have also invest a lot. We are -- we'll be ready at the end of the first quarter next year.</p><p>PHILIPPE AYMERICH: At the end of November.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sorry, at the end of November. So as of today -- and again, we see really the global relationship with all our clients. And again, don't forget the professional and corporates. And at this stage on the retail banking, I don't see any subcomponents which don't make sense in this global approach. And as it was mentioned by Claire, what we are doing is that we are really discovering new territories. And I think that these new territories will generate -- it's difficult to quantify yet, but significant income and significant income based on fees, so we have no impact on the capital.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, I had a question for Claire actually. The strategy is not dissimilar to what Acquia has been trying to do. Acquia is being distracted right now, but they've been a really strong -- they've built a strong ecosystem in about 7 to 8 years. How do you feel your -- how do you perceive your own ecosystem now? And when do you think you can get to the same level of aura, if you want, whereby you can really have an impact on all the different things you've identified?</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE: So I think Acquia has a strong branding and presence in France and -- but not necessarily worldwide or internationally, which is our presence. I think we've been getting very good feedback in France of Societe Generale interaction and the [open] innovation. And obviously, it was with Christophe before, so he can also complement what I am saying. But for example, we were the first one to open a space in [Le Jeune] in Paris where we were welcoming some of the start-ups early. And we've done that for 4 years before Station F was there, before WeWork was there. So before everything became cool, like, we were in the game, and we are also the only bank that provides the indiscernible] presence in Station F and provides services to the start-ups. So generally, in Paris, and the feedback we have about financial services provided to the ecosystem is quite good. I think where Acquia is probably a bit more leading than us is in their investment presence, and that's why we are setting up Societe Generale Ventures because our approach has been to test and learn and less a traditional corporate venture fund. And we can see, in the industry, some of the limitation of this approach about if you want to make strategic investments and you run a corporate venture fund, at one point, it's limiting because you have to make profit and you have to see how your ventures are building, where what we've done is we are combining strategic investment capability with a business venturing arm, which we have proven because of I've shown you as a venture we've been able to create internally, and we have been running this entrepreneurship program where, clearly, we know now, we build the muscle inside the organization. So that's what I will say for France. I think internationally, clearly, there is lags that exist already, outposts in different locations in Africa, so in Dakar, where YUP is strongly in relation with them. In Europe, we have a different species, in the U.S., in Asia. So I think all the bricks are there. We see me coming will put more weight because my reporting line has changed from Christophe to Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric directly, which want to sponsor these activities. And obviously, my reporting line will probably impact, also, our ability across our businesses to work and create more synergies and bring this knowledge and accelerate some of it.</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC: Yes. And we can mention as well that we have some -- the capacity to have the startup flows, okay, as the (inaudible) of what is going on, on the startup because we have some investment -- even there's no more strategy, but we have some investment in venture capital, and we are sharing the startup economy or what is going on in the startup ecosystem, if I may say. Yes? You have a question for a while?</p><p>OLIVIER PANIS: Olivier Panis, Moody's. Do you see any risk related to dependence on cloud providers? And how do you tackle also the security issues? I mean, we know the cloud providers have not been very white all the time so...</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC: I'd say, obviously, it's a point of attention for us, okay? So we have put together the legal setup with the 2 main provider science: Amazon and Microsoft. And the legal setup is already, in itself, very strong, okay, because we have the capacity, the reversibility. It has been a long negotiation, by the way, with the legal departments of those providers as well. So I would say we are covered there. Now, okay, we have obviously, as well, to monitor the security and control what is going on in the cloud. So the infrastructure people, okay, have put certain norms and conditions in order to go to the cloud. And so I will say just to tell you that it's not a free lunch. Now we can really -- everyone goes to the cloud without respecting certain conditions in terms of securities. And we are very -- it's obviously, I can tell you some debates -- internal debates, but we are very, very, very careful to expect this type of condition in terms of IT security. Lastly, okay, you know that we are expecting, obviously, GDPR, and GDPR itself, okay, is imposing certain conditions in terms of usage of data or personal data. So we are 3 of the top of these programmatic and making sure, with compliance and legal, that we respect everything. That being said, okay, the will to go to external cloud and to benefit from this context, okay, of external cloud is there, okay. And I think that our goal is at least to move a significant part of our infrastructure to external cloud, 20% by 2020, out of the 80% that I show. So really, we know that we cannot avoid or not look at it. This is an important component of our future innovation there. Let's be fair as well. Yes. There were questions from another place.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your budgeting around the EUR 4 billion-ish number that you spend every year on technology and also your controlling around that. And what kind of criteria do you use to determine what goes into the EUR 4 billion and what doesn't? You probably have EUR 6 billion of opportunities to spend every year, but you only spend EUR 4 billion. And what happens if you only have EUR 3 billion of projects in a given year where you think it's attractive to invest? And maybe related to this, how much of the EUR 4 billion is actually, in a way, fixed costs represented by your employees working in technology? And how much is really, let's say, discretionary on a shorter basis outsourced to others or components that you buy? If you could talk a bit about that, that would be great.</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC: Maybe one thing which is important to have in mind is that, out of the EUR 4 billion, so I mention it, EUR 1.8 billion is Change the Bank. It's really a new investment, new projects. It's largely dependent on the businesses because if a business wants to cut its cost to do an investment in technology, it's his choice. And by the way, a large part of them are starting to do that, and they are right to do that. I must say, it's not because I am a little bit conflicted (inaudible) let's be fair, okay? If they want to -- as we mentioned, a digital transformation is mandatory for a lot of them. So EUR 1.8 billion is certainly Change the Bank. So there is a capacity of maneuver. We can say we don't invest anymore, okay, but I don't think it will happen and this is what I said before. And EUR 1 billion is also infrastructure. A part of the EUR 1 billion is a little bit also Change the Bank because you have Change the Bank projects in infrastructure but largely a smaller part compared to the rest. So you see and this is why, okay, out of this EUR 2 billion plus of Run-the-bank, you have EUR 1 billion around infrastructure. And there, okay, we are doing obviously an efficiency stream. I mentioned the cloud. I said we are going to save EUR 100 million in terms of EUR 1 billion, okay, by 2020. And really, when we speak also about agility, it's about, also, efficiency. I'm making sure, with the CIOs of Societe General, that once, okay, we have invested in changing the methodology of the agile mode, we are able to grasp, I will say, to extract 3% per year over 5 years, okay, out of our, I will say, investment in this new methodology that we implement. So you see efficiency is a key focus, but the bulk of the EUR 1.8 billion is dependent, obviously, of the businesses. Now in terms of nature of expense. What is also important to have in mind is that we have obviously -- a large part is staff, out of this EUR 4 billion. Let's say, it's at least, I don't know, I don't have in mind the figures, but it's at least more than 50% that's (inaudible). But we have a piece which is a little bit, obviously, of variable cost, which is that we are using, obviously, external contractors, okay, to do certain -- so there, we have a sort of variability, [had we] to adjust our cost base. When we (inaudible) by the way. Okay? But our strategy is to maintain a percentage of external cost in our overall cost, but to drive -- while, okay, decreasing a little bit of the percentage because we feel that, obviously, it's more efficient to have internal staff. It's less -- it's cheaper and also to source this especially in, for instance, in India or Romania than to have external contractors. And so we have a balance to find there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Maybe just to add on the business standpoint. I mean, there is no big secret. Of course, we have a mandatory project, that's a given. After 4 business lines, that's very important to understand, with this IT department, what are going to be the key components for the future. And I'm speaking about technical components, for example, electronic signature, it was very important to develop it quickly because we knew that -- we knew and we know that we are going to use it everywhere. Once you have identified these key elementary bricks, after you have to choose what we are calling now the client's journey, which we should improve first. And there are 4 criteria. First one, it's client satisfaction. And for this one, we are taking mostly into account what is going on, on the market and not on the banking market, Uber, Facebook, all this kind of thing. Client experience, okay? Second criteria, of course, cost efficiency and how is it going to impact front office and back offices. The third component, and it's very important for the people, it's the benefits for the employees, the working environment. And the fourth one is, of course, the impact on the compliance and risk. And so for example, that's why we are started -- seems obvious that it was very important to start by the acquisition process because it's important for the client. It generates significant efficiency gains both on front office and back offices. (inaudible) staff was expecting for it. And finally, it helps us to address the famous QAC issue. So that's the way. And the good thing is that we have a roadmap which is quite clear. So we are not taking decision quarter-after-quarter. We have a view, this famous Transform To Grow view, which is helping us a lot to define the priorities year-after-year.</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE: There were 2 question, I think, left. I don't know if you still want to ask your question. Maybe we can take them at the same time and address them after.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: It's a similar question to the earlier questions on the EUR 4 billion. When I see that the IT force component will nearly double from 2018 to 2020, does that mean the EUR 4 billion component that's going the IT workforce salaries will also double?</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC: Why do you say that it will double, again, sorry?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: You got on Page 79 that percentage of IT workforce is going to increase from 27% to 50%.</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC: No, no. Sorry, I'm confused, okay. No, no, no. It's...</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE: Which number are you -- sorry, which number are you referring to?</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC: It's agility. Agility is -- no, it's different. Sorry, I was confused.</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE: Agility is different.</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC: Agility is about the percentage of the IT teams, which are working under a specific methodology, which is the agile methodology which was described by Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric in the morning. Suffice that we are able to really work in synch with the product with the business, and we are delivering in a fast cycle mode. This is a specific methodology. You need to train your people to do so. You need to train the business as well. So this is an investment, okay, but it's not at all the size of the workforce. The workforce is not able -- we are not planning to double it or to make it [27%]. Not at all. I say -- this is what I say it, okay, I see the more stability rather than an (inaudible) increase as you mentioned.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, just have a question on international retail and those markets where you've exited branch-based banking through disposals, so Poland, Bulgaria. Would you consider going back into those markets with a mobile-only strategy given that these are markets you're kind of relatively familiar with? So maybe also a question for Didier as well.</p><p>DIDIER HAUGUEL: Based on such things that are in the plan, I think that, basically -- and I think the YUP example shows it. It's a very strong asset to have a brick infrastructure and to have the click on the top of it, to build the click where we would have [executed] the bricks, I think would not put us in a very good position.</p><p>CLAIRE CALMEJANE: Thank you.</p><p>CHRISTOPHE LEBLANC: Thank you.</p><p>FR\u00c3\u00a9D\u00c3\u00a9RIC OUD\u00c3\u00a9A: Thank you very much. So It was very important for us to explain our vision, our vision for today, for tomorrow and after tomorrow, even for after tomorrow, it's coming very quickly. So it was a pleasure for you and we hope it was helpful for you. Okay. And now we can continue the interaction. We have a lunch.

The vast majority of that package, nearly 1.42 billion yen ($13.2 million), was base pay, with the rest noted as \"other\" compensation. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Vision Fund suffered operating losses of 1.9 trillion yen ($17.7 billion) for the period. Grappling with business missteps and the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, SoftBank had to write down the valuations of 47 companies in the fund, including startups like WeWork and Oyo. </p><p>Misra's compensation package is \"high,\" and it's \"hard to see how it could be based on performance,\" said Dan Baker, an analyst with research firm Morningstar. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son said at an earnings presentation earlier this month that he expects around 15 of the Vision Fund's 88 portfolio companies to go bankrupt. </p><p>Son earned 209 million yen ($1.9 million), a 9% pay cut compared to the previous year. Roughly 40% of that was paid out in stock options. </p><p>Even though Son's pay is low in comparison to Misra and some of his other executives, he also owns a 22% stake in the company worth roughly $20 billion. Estimates of his net worth vary: Forbes pegs it at $23.4 billion, while Bloomberg lists a value of $15.1 billion.</p><p>The pay hike for Misra, who serves as chief executive officer of SoftBank Investment Advisers, comes as startups that raised billions of dollars from the Vision Fund are laying off thousands of workers. He was the company's second-highest paid executive last year. </p><p>Marcelo Claure, SoftBank's chief operating officer, took the top spot, earning 2.1 billion yen ($19.6 million). The former telecom carrier executive has been tasked with turning around WeWork. He also helped get the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint across the finish line. </p><p>Executive salaries in Japan are generally lower than in the United States. A study in December from advisory firm Willis Towers Watson found median CEO pay in Japan was 156 million yen ($1.5 million) in 2018, compared to $13.7 million for CEOs in the United States. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

It seems SoftBank's fall from grace plumbs new depths each week. The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating the exposure of the Japanese conglomerate's weaknesses \u2014 and that of its $100bn Vision Fund \u2014 and there may be more to come, as our Big Story highlights today. The virus is also fomenting US-China tensions, with Chinese state-owned China Telecom the latest casualty.

The fund, which also counts Apple, Qualcomm, Foxconn and Sharp among its investors, has not indicated where specific problems lie among its 88 investments.</p><p>But some are glaringly obvious. The WeWork debacle saw the valuation of one of SoftBank\u2019s biggest portfolio companies slashed from $47bn in early 2019 to $7.8bn after it scrapped its IPO in September last year. Oyo, the Indian hotels start-up, is clearly in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/080db927-eea4-4d30-90fb-f3602179bb47\"> deep trouble</url>.

Investor scepticism is reflected in the big, persistent gap between the implicit worth of investments and SoftBank\u2019s lowly enterprise value.

Under the revised terms, SoftBank is shifting about $1.5 billion originally intended for Sprint itself to the company's shareholders; investors can now sell shares at $7.65 each, an increase of nearly 5 percent from the original offer. The revised offer is valued at about $7.48 a share, up nearly 19 percent from the earlier bid, Mr. de la Merced reports. SoftBank would own about 78 percent of Sprint if the deal is approved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sprint said it had ended sale talks with Dish, which in April had offered $25.5 billion, or about $7 a share, for all of Sprint. Dish has failed to put forward an acceptable formal bid, Sprint said in a statement. \"The new proposal by SoftBank, cobbled together largely over the weekend, is aimed at preserving SoftBank's biggest gamble: buying control of Sprint to challenge the existing titans of the American cellphone market, AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless,\" Mr. de la Merced writes.</p><p>The new offer, which has been approved by a special committee of Sprint's board, may sway some skeptical investors. Paulson &amp; Company, the hedge fund that is Sprint's second-largest shareholder, said it would support the new offer. Still, the revised offer would saddle Sprint with more debt, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.breakingviews.com/softbanks-bump-for-sprint-isnt-a-knock-out/21090593.article\">Peter Thal Larsen of Reuters Breakingviews writes</url>. \"That matters to the dynamics of the auction. SoftBank has made lower leverage one of the main virtues of its bid.\"</p><p>TREADING LIGHTLY IN STATEMENTS ON U.S. SPYING \u00a0|\u00a0 After revelations that the National Security Agency is engaged in a surveillance program of Internet users through a system called Prism, the biggest technology companies have responded by denying involvement in the spying apparatus. \"Of course, the news - as well as the responses - raises doubts about who is telling the truth and about how extensive the spying program really may be,\" <url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/tech-companies-tread-lightly-in-statements-on-u-s-spying/\">Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column</url>. \"But perhaps just as important, the episode also raises questions about how publicly traded companies with hundreds of millions of consumers - companies that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission - can, and should, react to news when pressed about involvement in confidential government programs.\"</p><p>\"Senior executives I spoke with at many of the technology companies cited in the Prism documents said they routinely provided the government with requested data, in some cases months' worth of e-mail traffic for a certain address,\" Mr. Sorkin writes. \"So while the nation's biggest technology companies may not be a part of systematic large-scale spying program, it is clear that they are legally required to play a significant role in funneling data to the government. That leaves them on a tightrope balancing what they can say to their customers and investors while complying with their obligations to keep the government's secrets.\"</p><p>WHEN BROKERS REQUEST A CLEAN SLATE \u00a0|\u00a0 As investors increasingly rely on BrokerCheck, the online database of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, to vet financial professionals, brokers and executives \"are pursuing every means possible to remove negative information from their records,\" <url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/a-rise-in-requests-from-brokers-to-wipe-the-slate-clean/\">Susan Antilla reports in DealBook</url>.</p><p>If an investor, for example, \"checked the securities industry's official regulatory database of complaints against brokers for the name of Michele Kief, a Wells Fargo broker in Naples, Fla., it would reveal nine client disputes - enough red flags to give a customer pause.

O valor pode chegar a dezenas de bilh\u00f5es, disse uma das pessoas, que pediu para n\u00e3o ser identificada.    Son, diretor-presidente do SoftBank, anunciou a unidade de investimento em teleconfer\u00eancia sobre o balan\u00e7o na ter\u00e7a-feira. Ele disse que a divis\u00e3o tem cerca de US$ 555 milh\u00f5es em capital. No entanto, o montante \u00e9 visto como um marcador de posi\u00e7\u00e3o, disseram pessoas com conhecimento do projeto; 555 \u00e9 uma g\u00edria na cultura de jogos japonesa que significa \"vai, vai, vai\".   A equipe de gest\u00e3o de ativos \u00e9 liderada por Akshay Naheta, vice-presidente s\u00eanior em Abu Dhabi, disseram as pessoas. O grupo tem acumulado discretamente participa\u00e7\u00f5es de bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares nas chamadas Big Tech dos EUA nos \u00faltimos meses, disseram as fontes.   Na ter\u00e7a-feira, Son disse que o SoftBank adquiriu a\u00e7\u00f5es em algumas empresas do chamado grupo FAANG: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix e Google, controlado pela Alphabet.   A empresa japonesa n\u00e3o divulgou o tamanho dessas posi\u00e7\u00f5es. Os investimentos foram feitos com estruturas de financiamento que podem impedir que a SoftBank apare\u00e7a em documentos regulat\u00f3rios como acionista direto, explicaram pessoas a par da iniciativa.   Um representante do SoftBank n\u00e3o quis comentar. \"Como uma empresa de investimentos, precisamos explorar v\u00e1rios \u00e2ngulos e escopos. Mas nosso foco ainda est\u00e1 em empresas que impulsionam a revolu\u00e7\u00e3o da informa\u00e7\u00e3o\", disse Son durante a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados. \"Este \u00e9 o prop\u00f3sito da nossa empresa.\"   O desenvolvimento de um ve\u00edculo de a\u00e7\u00f5es listadas foi impulsionado em parte por um desejo antigo de v\u00e1rios executivos do SoftBank de atuar na gest\u00e3o de ativos. Ap\u00f3s a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o da gestora de ativos alternativos Fortress Investment por US$ 3,3 bilh\u00f5es, o SoftBank tamb\u00e9m considerou a compra de uma participa\u00e7\u00e3o na Swiss Re, a segunda maior resseguradora do mundo.   O SoftBank est\u00e1 em processo de vender 4,5 trilh\u00f5es de ienes em ativos, incluindo a\u00e7\u00f5es do Alibaba, T-Mobile US e de sua unidade dom\u00e9stica de telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es. Parte do capital levantado ir\u00e1 financiar o bra\u00e7o de gest\u00e3o de ativos, disseram as pessoas. O SoftBank disse que ter\u00e1 participa\u00e7\u00e3o de 67% do grupo de gest\u00e3o de ativos, e Son ficar\u00e1 com o restante.   A nova unidade reflete as novas ambi\u00e7\u00f5es de Son. Em maio, o fundador disse que o SoftBank dificilmente conseguiria atrair investidores externos para um segundo Vision Fund ap\u00f3s problemas com o primeiro.

O valor pode chegar a dezenas de bilh\u00f5es, disse uma das pessoas, que pediu para n\u00e3o ser identificada.   Son, diretor-presidente do SoftBank, anunciou a unidade de investimento em teleconfer\u00eancia sobre o balan\u00e7o na ter\u00e7a-feira. Ele disse que a divis\u00e3o tem cerca de US$ 555 milh\u00f5es em capital. No entanto, o montante \u00e9 visto como um marcador de posi\u00e7\u00e3o, disseram pessoas com conhecimento do projeto; 555 \u00e9 uma g\u00edria na cultura de jogos japonesa que significa \"vai, vai, vai\".   A equipe de gest\u00e3o de ativos \u00e9 liderada por Akshay Naheta, vice-presidente s\u00eanior em Abu Dhabi, disseram as pessoas. O grupo tem acumulado discretamente participa\u00e7\u00f5es de bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares nas chamadas Big Tech dos EUA nos \u00faltimos meses, disseram as fontes.   Na ter\u00e7a-feira, Son disse que o SoftBank adquiriu a\u00e7\u00f5es em algumas empresas do chamado grupo FAANG: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix e Google, controlado pela Alphabet.   A empresa japonesa n\u00e3o divulgou o tamanho dessas posi\u00e7\u00f5es. Os investimentos foram feitos com estruturas de financiamento que podem impedir que a SoftBank apare\u00e7a em documentos regulat\u00f3rios como acionista direto, explicaram pessoas a par da iniciativa.   Um representante do SoftBank n\u00e3o quis comentar. \"Como uma empresa de investimentos, precisamos explorar v\u00e1rios \u00e2ngulos e escopos. Mas nosso foco ainda est\u00e1 em empresas que impulsionam a revolu\u00e7\u00e3o da informa\u00e7\u00e3o\", disse Son durante a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados. \"Este \u00e9 o prop\u00f3sito da nossa empresa.\"   O desenvolvimento de um ve\u00edculo de a\u00e7\u00f5es listadas foi impulsionado em parte por um desejo antigo de v\u00e1rios executivos do SoftBank de atuar na gest\u00e3o de ativos. Ap\u00f3s a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o da gestora de ativos alternativos Fortress Investment por US$ 3,3 bilh\u00f5es, o SoftBank tamb\u00e9m considerou a compra de uma participa\u00e7\u00e3o na Swiss Re, a segunda maior resseguradora do mundo.   O SoftBank est\u00e1 em processo de vender 4,5 trilh\u00f5es de ienes em ativos, incluindo a\u00e7\u00f5es do Alibaba, T-Mobile US e de sua unidade dom\u00e9stica de telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es. Parte do capital levantado ir\u00e1 financiar o bra\u00e7o de gest\u00e3o de ativos, disseram as pessoas. O SoftBank disse que ter\u00e1 participa\u00e7\u00e3o de 67% do grupo de gest\u00e3o de ativos, e Son ficar\u00e1 com o restante.   A nova unidade reflete as novas ambi\u00e7\u00f5es de Son. Em maio, o fundador disse que o SoftBank dificilmente conseguiria atrair investidores externos para um segundo Vision Fund ap\u00f3s problemas com o primeiro. Mas, nos resultados financeiros otimistas divulgados na ter\u00e7a-feira, Son mostrou disposi\u00e7\u00e3o para acelerar uma transi\u00e7\u00e3o do setor de telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es para investimentos. \"Nossa estrat\u00e9gia n\u00e3o mudou\", disse Son. \"Ainda planejamos ca\u00e7ar unic\u00f3rnios com o Vision Fund dois, tr\u00eas e assim por diante.\"   \u00a92020 Bloomberg

The reason for using the word 'intriguing' is that I know some owners of prime San Francisco property who were hoping that prices for homes like theirs would double based on the tsunami of unicorn IPOs slotted for this year, and newly minted millionaires looking to park their money in suitable digs.  Now admittedly, in the cases where the IPO has fallen below its initial offering price (we're looking at you, Uber, along with Lyft and Pinterest), others like Beyond Meat and Crowdstrike traded up nicely. Remember that only a portion of a company's shares are sold in an IPO; insiders cashing out fully is very bad form, as well as bearish-looking, so even employees who got in early and got a nice chuck of change in the IPO might be a wee bit chastened by the aftermarket wobbles. </p><p>Even so, most of the remaining 2019 IPOs are on track, save for AirBnB [1]due to mounting legal challenges not making for the best investor story. Yet despite all this new liquidity flowing largely into West Coast hands, the Wall Street Journal reports that on what looks to be a broad basis, urban West Coast real estate is languishing. If this were one city, you could attribute it to local factors, like a spike in residential construction. But that doesn't seem to be a significant factor. From the Journal[2]: U.S. home sales slumped in June as home prices for major West Coast cities declined for the first time since 2012, ending the spring selling season with a thud. Real-estate agents said lower asking prices could eventually attract more buyers, but home values in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle have roughly doubled over the past seven years. That means prices may have to retreat further before buyers do more than look, economists said. 'Prices have dropped in Silicon Valley and sellers just aren't used to the concept that [prices] can go down,' said Ken DeLeon, founder of DeLeon Realty in Palo Alto, Calif. 'There's just this malaise buyers had of, 'I feel like it's gonna drop further.''. The median price of a home fell in San Jose, Seattle and Los Angeles in June, compared with a year earlier, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin. For San Jose, that was the seventh month of annual price declines. The slowdown in the West Coast marketsnow spans all price points, including starter homes, which had been the tightest segment of the market. In San Jose, inventory for homes in the bottom-third price tier nearly doubled in June compared with a year earlier, while prices dropped 3.8%, according to Redfin. What is striking about this shift is the breadth of the change: it's hitting so many West Coast cities, and across so many types of homes. The article attributes the price reversal to two factors: that prices have outstripped incomes of even high-end professionals, and the Trump tax reforms have limited the deductibility of property taxes and mortgage interest in high-price, high tax states like California. But if tax changes were the main driver, you'd expect the dampening to be most pronounced in the biggest-ticket properties.  One Journal reader volunteered that first time buyers were knowingly speculating on price appreciation and planning to make relatively quick flips. If this practice is as widespread as he intimates, one wonders how many will be caught out: PATRICK MROWCZYNSKI Many people (and I'm talking families with modest means, both working parents needing 1000-1500+ sq ft in Santa Clara) is to often start with an interest only loan (e.g. 7/1 ARM) and then try to flip the home in 3-5 years after a 20-30% run up in prices.  Take the gains and use that as a down payment on a more modest home with a traditional mortgage. The first step in this often rewards those who pick up a larger home than they normally could afford in order to maximize the gain (via leverage).  In the San Jose Metropolitan area, we're looking at sq ft prices of $500-$800 for homes built decades ago.  Admittedly, in light of the boom in the biggest cities, the slackening this year is just a blip. But when real estate professionals, who are constitutionally optimistic, say that things are likely to get worse before they get better, they are probably right since that view is so out of character.  How does the sharp decline in Chinese investment in the US play into this picture? On the one hand, 'Chinese nationals' accounted for only 3% of US housing buys in 2018[3]. But wealthier foreign buyers often use corporations to mask their ownership, so this figure understates the magnitude of Chinese purchases. And Chinese investors like California. Last week, CNBC reported Foreign purchases of American homes plunge 36% as Chinese buyers flee the market[4]: The dollar volume of homes purchased by foreign buyers from April 2018 through March 2019 dropped 36% from the previous year, according to the National Association of Realtors. The decline was due to a drop in the number and average price of purchases. Foreigners bought 183,100 properties with a total value of about $77.9 billion, down from 266,800 valued at $121 billion in the previous period. Notice also that foreign buyers on average pay more than locals, suggesting a combination of typically preferring higher-end properties and overpaying1: Another data point suggesting that the West Coast well-off may be feeling nervous or even pinched comes in another Journal story, this one on Tesla. Its high-end, as in highest-status cars, aren't selling well any more: Sales of Tesla Inc.'s high-end Model S sedan have taken a big hit in the company's most important U.S. market, California, as the electric auto maker is leaning more heavily on selling the lower-priced Model 3 compact car, new data show. Falling sales of the Model S\u2014and its sister sport-utility vehicle Model X\u2014threaten Tesla's growth goals and profit ambitions as it must rely more on its cheaper Model 3 to make up the difference. Registrations of new Model S sedans in the second quarter plummeted 54% to 1,205 in California, according to the Dominion Cross-Sell report, which compiles data from state motor-vehicle records. The Golden State is a strong indicator of demand as Tesla's largest U.S. market, representing 40% of Model S registrations in the country last year, according to auto-sales tracker Edmunds.com Inc. The new data from research firm Dominion Enterprises indicates the stylish sedan that arguably changed car buyers' view of electric cars is losing its luster. So is the West Coast starting to lose its mojo? Are these wobbles an an early warning that the economy is getting soft? Or is this a sign that air is coming out of the Silicon Valley bubble, and that touches enough people on the Pacific coast to have a bigger impact than you'd expect? Tech titans are finally being depicted as 21st century robber barons. They aren't used to having their status as Masters of the Universe questioned, let alone having their economic interests targeted.  For instance, the lead story today in all the business press is that the Department of Justice is launching an investigation into whether 'online platforms' were hurting competition. It's easy to depict this as a gambit for the US to get in front of the European Commission's competition ministry, which is threatening to become more stringent. Recall also that France is threatening to impose a transactions tax that would hit 24 large tech players, many of them American. From the Financial Times[5]: The US Department of Justice announced a broad antitrust investigation into the leading online platforms, raising the stakes in Washington's scrutiny of Big Tech's power over growing parts of the economy. The agency said it would look into how the platforms had achieved their market power, and whether they were 'engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers'. The DoJ move comes after the outgoing European Commission signalled it was also looking to become more aggressive in checking the market power of the largest online platform companies. Areport issued in April recommended lowering the bar for companies deemed 'dominant players', subjecting them to stricter antitrust rules. Donald Trump has been critical of the EU's scrutiny of American tech groups, suggesting it should beUS rather than European authorities investigating wrongdoing by the technology sector.  It's obvious the DoJ intent is to blunt whatever the Europeans might do. But it's hard to see how that can work. The EU can set the rules for its own market, which is so large that it will impose costs on tech giants, both via reducing their revenues and/or profits, and by requiring them to do business differently. That imposes costs via having to make changes to their systems and procedures and forces them to incur ongoing costs via having more balkanized operations. Mr. Market took note, with Facebook and Amazon shares falling more than a percent in after-hours trading, while Google recovered from a similar drop. The pink paper described how there have been jurisdictional issues regarding which agency, the Federal Trade Commission or the DoJ, should be taking the lead not just with respect to the general question of anti-trust but also with respect to particular companies.  It's admittedly a long time before anything happens legally but the presumption of tech virtue is over, and that's a step in the right direction.  ____ 1 Having worked with foreign investors, this is way more common than you'd think. It's easy for a broker to take a buyer who doesn't know the city or market to a few wildly overpriced properties, then show them ones only somewhat overpriced to give them the false impression that the latter are a good deal. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/07/softening-real-estate-markets-in-prime-west-coast-cities-does-china-trump-ipos.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/07/softening-real-estate-markets-in-prime-west-coast-cities-does-china-trump-ipos.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Economic fundamentals[6], Investment outlook[7], Real estate[8], Regulations and regulators[9], Technology and innovation[10] on July 24, 2019[11] by Yves Smith[12].

Much of the growth has come from solar installations. </p><p>North Carolina's 396.6 megawatts of solar installations[2] in 2014 was second only to sunny California, according to the Solar Energy Installations Association.&lt;nl/&gt; Solar's growth in North Carolina is bolstered by two forces: state policies that incentivized renewable energy projects and the rapid price decline of photovoltaic panels, explains a Pew Trusts report[3]. North Carolina remains the only Southeastern state with a renewable energy portfolio standard, a requirement that utilities obtain a certain percentage of their power generation from renewable sources. Solar projects benefit from a 35 percent state tax credit that make new solar installations more attractive investments. Clean energy projects generated more than $2.6 billion in revenue between 2007 to 2013, compared against $135.2 million in state incentives offered for such projects in that period, according to the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association[4].&lt;nl/&gt; But some in the solar industry now wonder how the loss of government incentives will affect solar's growth. North Carolina lawmakers did not extend the state's renewable energy tax credit, set to expire at the end of 2015. Renewable energy projects will also see a reduction in the federal tax credit, which will drop from 30 percent to 10 percent at the end of 2016.&lt;nl/&gt; 'We don't know what that's going to mean,' says Ivan Urlaub, executive director of the NCSEA. 'We do know that residential scale and small commercial scale clean energy systems of all types and sizes were eligible for our tax credit and not necessarily eligible for federal incentives, and we've seen marked and consistent growth across all of those tech areas \u2026 we attribute that to the [state] tax credit.'&lt;nl/&gt; Urlaub says much of the growth in solar installations have come from residential and commercial builders taking the initiative to include more solar in their construction. Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK[5]), a longtime target of environmental groups critical of the utility's coal-fired power generation, has also embraced solar. The Charlotte, NC-based company now operates 21 solar farms[6]\u201410 in North Carolina\u2014producing more than 150 megawatts of power. Duke's new solar construction includes a 65 megawatt project[7] in Warsaw, NC, that will become the largest solar farm east of the Mississippi River.&lt;nl/&gt; Duke sees growing renewable energy demand from some of its largest customers\u2014technology companies now making reducing carbon footprints part of corporate sustainability initiatives. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL[8]) 20 megawatt solar farm[9] alongside its data center in Maiden, NC, offsets its Duke power consumption. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN[10]) is building the Southeast's first commercial-scale wind farm[11] on a tract of undeveloped land on the northeast North Carolina coast through a contract with Iberdrola Renewables, a Spanish company that operates wind farms in 17 U.S. states. That project will connect to Virginia-based Dominion Resources (NYSE: D[12]).&lt;nl/&gt; Urlaub took time to speak with Xconomy during the NCSEA's annual 'Making Energy Work' conference last week. He discussed the expiration of the state tax credit; the prospect for energy storage\u2014such as mega batteries manufactured by energy startup Alevo[13]\u2014to become viable utility-scale technology; and the challenges of developing sustainable energy policies in a state where the law requires rate-regulated utilities to provide the 'least cost' energy sources. Portions of Urlaub's interview follow, condensed and edited for space and clarity.&lt;nl/&gt; Xconomy: What are you hearing from solar developers, installers? Are they giving you any indication of where they think things might be going after the tax credit expires?&lt;nl/&gt;<url normalizedValue=\"https://d1nw8lqlu0ss4w.cloudfront.net/wordpress/wp-content/images/2015/10/IvanUrlaubMug.jpg&lt;nl/&gt;Ivan\">https://d1nw8lqlu0ss4w.cloudfront.net/wordpress/wp-content/images/2015/10/IvanUrlaubMug.jpg&lt;nl/&gt;Ivan</url> Urlaub: We have so much lag on the regulatory front, because we're so accustomed to looking at everything we do in electricity in a regulatory manner like it was 20 years ago. Amidst this fully regulated market environment, with regulatory lag and monopoly utilities that are not terribly transparent, I think companies are looking at business model innovations for themselves that go even more aggressively, now directly to the customer. Often people in industry tell me that having to go through the utilities in the Southeast market can kill your business. Solar has taken off because they can build qualifying facilities \u2026 With the tax credit going away, that raises the question longer term: What will be that impact?&lt;nl/&gt; I think businesses in solar are preparing for transforming their products and service offerings, maybe evolving them, for the 2017 market. Whereas all the other tech are looking to do that for the 2016 market. How do you bundle service, product? Maybe bundling solar and storage, but especially energy efficiency. Bringing more Internet of Things-enabled tech behind the meter to customers. Getting them more data in easy-to-use and easy-to-act-on ways. I think a lot of the smaller companies, smaller system installers, are looking at that. And we have this huge manufacturing ecosystem in the state. Our industry clusters are strong and growing in storage and smart grid. We have the top smart grid clusters in the country. They're not deploying here as much as they're deploying elsewhere.&lt;nl/&gt; X: Is that a regulatory issue?&lt;nl/&gt; IU: It's not just a regulatory issue. There are aspects of value streams that storage should be able to realize that they're just not going to be able to [realize] on the current regulatory approach in the Southeast, and maybe in similarly situated regulated states elsewhere in the country. What do the rules of the road need to be for storage going forward, so that people can say North Carolina allows what I need it to allow, and gives me the clarity I need to do deals to deploy storage in this market? If we can find a way to do that that's consistent with our current regulatory principles, which is almost a singular principle of least cost, then that's something that could be replicated across half the states in the country and immediately unlock the storage market.&lt;nl/&gt; That's exactly what we did with solar. When solar gets deployed in North Carolina because of a mix of policies in place that enable the revenue streams to flow to the project, it has this net effect of keeping rates lower than they would have been. Back in the middle of the last decade, we intentionally designed policy with the idea that deployment would have the effect of dampening the rise of electricity rates. Our evidence shows that that happened. But the tax credit was a key piece of that.&lt;nl/&gt; X: Google has a large data center in Maiden powered by solar. Facebook is pushing for more renewable energy for its data center. Amazon is building a wind farm. To what extent are big tech companies driving demand for renewable energy in the state?&lt;nl/&gt; IU: They've been a critical voice. They were very vocal this year as well-funded opposition activists showed up and motivated a small handful of really vocal legislators to try to gut all of our clean energy policies. That forced legislators to pay attention and really think through this issue. These well-funded campaigns, by spreading so much disinformation, are their own worst enemy. They created a good opening for large companies, like Google, to do what they've been doing, which is to take a really responsible approach to their energy and resource management and engage decision makers in each state where they do business, and say, 'Enable us to be good stewards of the local economy and the resources. You're not enabling us right now if you change your laws, and we'd actually prefer you do some things in the other direction.'&lt;nl/&gt; It's key that [tech companies] don't just go try to accomplish those operational goals and corporate objectives, but also try to engage society. It created a safe space, politically, for a whole bunch of other large [energy] consumers and employers in our state that are the backbone of our economy to also step up and add their voice, because they all want the same thing.&lt;nl/&gt; X: There have been studies done showing the wind energy resource potential in the state. Why has it taken so long to get wind energy projects sited in North Carolina?&lt;nl/&gt; IU: North Carolina is blessed with an amazing landscape. In the mountains, a lot of people have decided, culturally, that they don't want wind turbines. They don't want to look at them. On the coast, there's a lot of tourism, there's a lot of wildlife, there's a lot of military. We have to be very thorough in the siting process. There are so many considerations we have to grapple with than other states. And our wind speeds are a little slower overall on land. With Iberdrola coming with its slightly larger turbine, they can make more economic use [of the available wind]. The site that they picked, when they made it through the [Department of Defense] clearinghouse, that was the last hurdle they needed to clear that prevented people who were ideologically opposed to wind from being able to stop it.&lt;nl/&gt; X: With Iberdrola moving forward with the Amazon project, does that pave the way for more wind energy projects in North Carolina?&lt;nl/&gt; IU: It could. Something that's really critical is that project would not originally have been proposed if it were not for the renewable and efficiency portfolio standard, but the project's contract does not rely on the REPS. I don't know if it's going to use the tax credit or not, but most likely not, since the legislature decided to not extend it. What we're seeing is because we had the policies in place, it sent enough market signal for Iberdrola, and many other developers, to come to this state and prospect and engage landowners and local government. They were able to continue in both their technology and business model, and find ways to take advantage of what is there in terms of regulatory construct and access to PJM (the regional transmission organization that manages the grid in the region), to get a project done. It's a massive benefit, not just to the local economy\u2014$400 million investment\u2014but also ratepayers. Now all that wind energy is going to be pumping into the grid in the next year at a really affordable price.&lt;nl/&gt; X: What about offshore wind, where the wind energy potential is greater?&lt;nl/&gt; IU: We know we have this phenomenal, and the largest, resource potential\u2014even after excluding for all sorts of military, economic, and environmental considerations. We don't have strong east-west transmission capacity. We have a transmission group of utilities and others that have been looking at that in North Carolina the last couple of years. BOEM [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] has been taking positive steps forward allowing us to being able to have leased sales out in the ocean. But it seems like we're still quite a ways away.&lt;nl/&gt; X: So the economics still need to be worked out?&lt;nl/&gt; IU: Being almost solely a least-cost state in terms of electricity regulation, either they're going to need to contract with entities outside of the state and be able to somehow move that power to others, like PJM, or come up with some contractual arrangement. Or we're going to have to find a way to make it work with our utilities in the state. It raises real questions. Duke Energy may be the largest market cap IOU [investor-owned utility] in the country, but they're one fifth the size of Electricte de France. EDF can build out a whole bunch of nuclear power plants to just to keep their nuclear workforce fresh. When someone shows up and builds several thousand megawatts of independent power, it can fundamentally, deeply disrupt [Duke's] financial stability and viability as an IOU\u2014even the largest in the U.S.\u2014if they don't have a role.&lt;nl/&gt; We almost had a pilot project for utilities signed off on between South Carolina and North Carolina a couple of years ago. But it came down to the last day and Duke just wouldn't sign on to it. So North Carolina could arguably be in the initial stages of construction right now on a 40 MW offshore wind farm if Duke had signed on to it, but they didn't.&lt;nl/&gt; X: What's your sense of the environment for cleantech startups? The Council for Entrepreneurial Development releases an annual report on funding[14]. Cleantech is always at the bottom in terms of number of deals and dollars raised. How do you see the cleantech environment for startups?&lt;nl/&gt; IU: That's not my area of expertise, but I'm learning a lot more\u2014our whole organization is\u2014because we're partnering more and more with organizations like CLT Joules [a cleantech accelerator based at Packard Place in Charlotte][15]. What I have spent a lot of time thinking about and talking to our government about for the last few years is raising the question: Why do we see so many of our startups not be able to demonstrate and scale in North Carolina? Quite often our most successful startups in the clean energy space end up deploying product or service outside of the state. You can't really be an innovation-based economy if you're just really good at housing startups \u2026 if they don't have a pathway or market opportunity for growth here, or arguably in the Southeast, what's to keep them here when they start to succeed? Our industry clusters are prominent and strong but they mostly export. At some point, we need to understand what can change, and how.&lt;nl/&gt; Reprints[16] | Share:       \u00a0    <url

There was just one catch: None of it was true. The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor -- and sometimes President Trump -- to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more. </p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly -- and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads -- they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner. Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state government officials who noticed the ads. The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections -- and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation -- loom. \"This is definitely concerning -- definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin, Madison, professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\" In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all the ads and several pages affiliated with them. \"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\" Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies. After researching solar panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, N.J., 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy (D) planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be. \"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said. The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address -- a mailbox in Carlsbad, Calif. -- that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company -- then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough -- for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records. Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings. Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business. Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers. -- Amanda Seitz and Mae Anderson, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W19-SH31-JDGB-0007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 4, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
