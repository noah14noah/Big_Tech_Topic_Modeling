What I would say to her in relation to this white paper is that those harms of the top and the seriousness of the spectrum, including the promotion of terrorism, will receive the greatest possible attention from the regulator, and our expectations will be higher from government. Hence, the Home Secretary interest in the way it developed so that online companies are doing their utmost to ensure that these kind of behaviours are challenged. Can I think the secretary of state for a statement, cat fishing is the death of the persons identity to exploit social domain people. </p><p>We must become aware. We must change the behaviour of those who exploit others. As the Secretary as they have any discussions with the Home Secretary of making cat fishing a criminal offence? Mr Speaker, I have had no specific conversation exactly on that point was that belt she will recognise when she has a chance to look on it is that cat fishing is referred to in the course of the white paper and if these offences are fried representation, they may be on the statute book. It might be good to look at what it might be, and make sure that we discussed it with our colleagues in the Home Office. Mr Speaker, can I think the secretary of state but this report. It is in line with the select committee. I am from neighbouring last November when 100 women MPs from 100 different countries met in this chamber in time and time again we were hearing how the abuse that women politicians get as temporary them from doing their jobs, and a direct attack against democracy, and they were looking to the UK to take global leadership. Thank you Secretary of State for taking that leadership and can you confirm that duty of care is not censorship, it is not curtailing freedom of the price, but it is going to help protect democracy as well as individuals? I can't confirm that. It is important to repeat that this is a process that we believe is necessary to level the playing field. These are abuses that if they were happening in any other environment could be -- would be controlled. The point that she makes about the abuse that female politicians has to endure, very much echoes the honourable lady who speaks by the Scottish Nationalist party, and she is right. It is not just politicians. Female journalists and others in public life have to endure the same. It is unacceptable and must stop. I am pleased to see that the Home Secretary have the concerns of our committees about extremist terrorist companies and I look forward to the action on this. Can I press further on the issue of the integrity of our elections, referendums, and our democracy on a day-to-day basis? About the millions being spent on advertising, dark money, going on at this moment, does he not agree that we need action today, not waiting months for that to come? I hope the honourable judgement will not have to wait months. He raises fair concerns, and I had indicated that the government is not going to those concerns, but this particular paper does not deal with that subject, but the government will be producing very shortly a document that will. Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is not just the big tech giants that are active in the digital space, it is our local papers. The reddish advertiser, who do the fantastic job of holding us accountable to politicians. Can the secretary of state confirm that the papers will not affect the ability of our small local papers who do not have a massive resource base to do their job? Yes, Mr Speaker, I can confirm that. We are not concerned with the activity of journalist or their editors. I will go for the day. It seems to me that in fact both local and national recognised journalists who do a good job of the bike they do is part of that solution and not the problem, particularly to the disinformation that has been identified across the house is one of the fundamental hundreds we are concerned about.

Many packaged bank accounts now, the travel insurance but many people only discover what the are not covered for when they need to claim. This causes huge distress and expense for a family from my constituency this summer so can we have a debate on what more banks should do to be upfront with people at Clifton the outset that what they are covered for? That is a good point, we all have experiences are being sold extras that then somehow don't happen when you try and claim on them so I think the honourable lady with a good point and again I would encourage her to raise that with Treasury ministers next week. </p><p>Thank you Mr Speaker, my constituent's mother Nadia is Ukrainian and on her last visit from the UK it coincided with the Russian annexation of Ukraine. Sorry, the the Russian invasion and disruption of Ukraine. The Home Office advice was not the travel at that time and that the actually stayed longer than her visa and applied for leave to remain, which is at hand home as soon as she possibly could. She has now applied for a family visa to visit her family but it has been turned down because she did not properly highlight the withdrawn application. I have asked for a review of this and immigration officials are sticking to their guns is up and later make a statement outlining what our options are for me as a parliamentarian to help Nadia get a Visa to visit her young grandchildren watermark I congratulate the honourable gentleman for raising this particular constituency case. As he often does in this place. And if you'd like me to take it up with ministers on his behalf perhaps he would write to me the details? Thank you Mr Speaker. I note how many members across the house are currently face down on a smartphone and tablet and I realise they are multitasking but there is now growing evidence about the link between the use of technology such as what funds and promotional health particularly among young people. Can we have a debate on government time about what more can be done to get the big tech companies to take this issue seriously? I agree with the honourable gentleman that we spent far too much time on technology and particularly for young people are thinking about skills are saying to the students that they can't have their devices during the course of the day, it is a contentious subject but I certainly support it personally. The honourable death is right, it is a key issue the sense we are undertaking a massive experiment because there is no regulation around us. In her attempt to seek a backbench debates that all honourable members can share views and we can debate that with ministers. The resolution foundation report calling for Universal Credit roll out to be stopped is the seventh in the last six months. I have had constituents who have had applications that have been never received, documents that have been lost, delaying several weeks on top of the five weeks design that the had to wait before they received their first payment. It is clearly not fit for purpose or can we have a debate on government time on new Social Security policy and the need British people? I have to say, for a new social contract with the Universal Credit is designed to help, it is a better, simpler and more flexible system that helps more people into work. She may not like it, but that is the truth of it. Under the old system if you worked one-minute over 16 hours they knew what you're all job-seekers allowance. Universal Credit or requires you to make one application and it makes sure that work always pays. Research published this month shows that Universal Credit means 8 million EU extra for the economy, an extra 200,000 people in work. And an extra 130 million more working hours every year for those already in a job. Now she raises an important point which is about the wallet of Universal Credit, and she will be aware that the government is listening very carefully to the evidence in this place and from users. We have raised advances to 100% of the first month's payment so she is not right to say that people are having to wait five weeks, that is something not the case. We have made it quicker and easier for people to get their -- get their first payments so everyone can get their money on the very same day. We have introduced an overlap for those already receiving housing benefit to make sure they have a new transition, a smooth transition onto the new system. We continue to look very carefully at the roll-out to improve it but said they say we should halt it is to deny the many people the opportunity and Mr Speaker, you would not limited time but I could give her countless examples of people who have really benefited Universal Credit, getting into work for the first time.

I angry -- I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed, but can I bring him back to the issue of the border. I agree with him about the ends he tries to achieve but the fundamental problem is the means. We know his own party and the DUP will not accept the current backstop and the only way the government plans to avoid the backstop is to deliver a so called invisible border, but last week we saw a leaked Home Office presentation stating that, and I quote, no government worldwide currently has a system in place and 2030 is the time for the UK and there is currently no budget for either a pilot or for the programme itself. </p><p>So can the Minister tell us are the Home Office wrong? Well, I'm not going to comment on alleged leaks from government departments, but what I can say to the house is that the government has allocated #20 million to invest in work on alternative measures that would bring benefits in terms of seamless trade, both to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but which, if successful, more generally, could be applied to give us smart borders on all of the UK's external borders and perhaps offer us export opportunities for that technology as well. It's interesting what the minister says, but the Home Office also says that there are six problems with deploying the technological solutions. It is expensive, there is no budget. It has to operate with 28 different government agencies. It has to operate on both sides of the border. It won't be deliverable until 2030. With covenant has a poor track record on big tech projects. And nobody in the world has done anything similar. So that, Mr Speaker, is hardly a recipe for success. The real answer to the Northern Ireland border question is staring the government in the face. 28 months ago and two Brexit secretaries ago I told the minister from this dispatch box that the only way to avoid a hard border was staying in a customs union and, of course, the alignment of all rules and regulations and he himself said three years ago that for anybody to pretend otherwise he said flies in the face of reality. That was the truth then and it remains the truth today, so why will the government just not wake up to it? I did say to the Right Honourable lady in our previous exchange that there is a #20 million budget that has already been earmarked for this work. It is also the case, whatever the Right Honourable lady might be reading in the newspapers about timetables, that not just the UK but the European Union has committed itself to try to get these alternative measures agreed by 2020. That is not an undertaking or commitment that the European Commission has entered into lightly and without some thought and analysis about the chances of achieving that. But could I say to the Right Honourable lady, the solution she identifies of needing to have a frictionless border on the island of Ireland is what is delivered by the government's withdrawal agreement. Therefore, what she should be doing is urging her Right Honourable and honourable friends to vote for what the government is proposing instead of rejecting it and therefore blocking the Brexit which her party's manifesto commits her to. Mr Speaker, we've heard it all before, let's face it. The only point the Minister didn't make this time was that Britain must be able to establish her own international trade agreements. Perhaps he has been listening to Nancy Pelosi who made it clear that if the UK Government disrupted the open border in Northern Ireland, we could forget about a free trade deal with the US. So the government will spend millions giving Donald Trump the red carpet and golden carriage treatment in June and maybe the state banquet might be worth it so long as he is forced to sit next to Greta Thunberg. He could have greater on one side and David Attenborough on the other and that would be three hours well spent. But the truth is that it will all be a giant waste of taxpayer money because the US Congress will never agree to a trade deal unless we have a solution for the Irish border that will actually work. And this government simply doesn't have one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCPAR-60d9c401e79f4f80b8afdcdabd63e277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCPAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYJ-C6K1-DY08-308V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402041</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The hearing comes after key partners like Paypal, Visa, and Mastercard backed out of the project earlier this month following heavy scrutiny of the project from lawmakers. In his opening testimony, Zuckerberg reiterated that the company will not support launching the Libra system at all until all regulatory concerns have been met. He also said that he believes pressing forward with Libra is important for the United States to keep up with China, which he said is moving forward with similar ideas. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is testifying[3] before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, where lawmakers will grill him about Libra, the global currency and payments network the company announced in June as well as issues relating to allegations of advertising discrimination on its platform. The hearing comes at a pivotal time for the Libra project; earlier this month, several early partners dropped out of the effort[4], including payments and finance firms Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal. Shortly thereafter, the remaining members of the Libra Association \u2014 the consortium of 21 firms that will govern the network and currency \u2014 met to formalize the organization's council, elect a board of directors, and appoint members of its executive team. The move indicated that the plan was moving full steam ahead despite heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and the exit of several key founding members. In her opening remarks, Chairwoman of the committee and Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) once again called for a moratorium on the project until Congress can examine the issues that come with a large tech firm like Facebook being involved in the development of a digital currency. Waters urged Facebook to fix the company's problems before expanding into a new industry \u2014 highlighting issues ranging from a lack of diversity in Facebook's leadership to its failure to protect consumer data. She also criticized the company's decision not to fact-check political ads, saying that it could lead to voter suppression. \"Your claim to promote freedom of speech does not ring true,\" Waters said, adding that it seems like Zuckerberg believes he's above the law and that such concerns raise a \"serious discussion\"about whether Facebook should be broken up.Youtube Embed: //<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/isTB1Bpl9SA\">www.youtube.com/embed/isTB1Bpl9SA</url> Width: 560px Height: 315pxZuckerberg's opening testimonyIn his opening testimony, which was made public on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said his company would not participate in rolling out Libra until all regulation concerns have been met. Waters pressed Facebook executive David Marcus on this point during a previous hearing back in July, and did not interpret his answer as a commitment back then. \"Facebook will not be a part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world unless all US regulators approve it,\" Zuckerberg says in his opening remarks. \"And we support Libra delaying its launch until it has fully addressed US regulatory concerns.\" Lawmakers and critics have expressed concern about Facebook's involvement in the financial system for a number of reasons: the blunders it has made when handling the personal data of its social network's members in the past, its sheer size and scale \u2014 which lawmakers worry could enable Libra to grow too quickly to properly manage \u2014 and the potential risk for the system being used by criminals or to finance terrorism. \"I believe this is something that needs to get built, and I understand we're not the ideal messenger right now,\" he said. \"We've faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I'm sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward.\" The Facebook CEO reiterated that his company will not be leading the project moving forward \u2014 that task now rests with the recently formalized Libra Association \u2014 adding that the organization is currently talking with elected officials in Congress. He also said that any payments processed through Facebook or its subsidiaries \u2014 including any eventual Libra-based transactions or those that occur through Instagram Shopping and Facebook Messenger today \u2014 are subject to \"comprehensive anti-money laundering, counterterrorist financing, and sanctions monitoring.\" There have also been concerns about whether companies like Facebook should be involved in the financial system at all, especially considering the bubbling antitrust related tensions that have surrounded firms like Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Amazon in recent months. A draft bill called the \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act\" was also discussed at the July hearing, which would prevent a platform company like Facebook from becoming a registered financial institution in the United States. In his testimony, Zuckerberg addressed this point as well. \"Monetary policy is in the province of central banks, not Libra,\" Zuckerberg's testimony says. \"The Libra Association has no intention of competing with any sovereign currencies or entering the monetary policy arena. . .We expect the regulatory framework for the Libra Association will ensure that the Association cannot interfere with monetary policy.\" Zuckerberg also provided more insight about why Facebook is becoming involved in a project like Libra at all. During his prepared testimony, he said that a project like Libra could be critical for ensuring that the United States maintains its positional as a leader in finance and doesn't get left behind as other global powers like China push ahead. \"While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn't waiting,\" Zuckerberg says in his testimony. \"China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months. Libra will be backed mostly by dollars and I believe it will extend America's financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world. If America doesn't innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.\" But Libra isn't the only subject the committee is seeking answers on. The hearing is being held to discuss Facebook's impact on the housing sector as well, coming after the Department of Housing and Urban Development filed a claim in March[5] alleging that Facebook was \"encouraging, enabling, and causing housing discrimination\" by allowing would-be landlords to restrict who could see housing ads on the basis of race, color, sex, familial status, and other factors. Zuckerberg recapped the changes Facebook has made to its ad platform to prevent such abuse, including requiring that advertisers go through an ads-purchasing process that prohibits targeting by age, gender or zip code. \"This has been a challenging few years for Facebook,\" Zuckerberg said at the end of his opening remarks. \"I know we have a lot to do, but I also know that the problem of financial under-inclusion is solvable, and I believe that we can play a role in helping to find the solution.\" This story is developing, please refresh for the latest.NOW WATCH: How to use the

I'm friday/Shutterstock.com[1]  Courtesy ofJennifer Grygiel[2], Syracuse University[3] When word broke that the massacre in New Zealand was livestreamed on Facebook, I immediately thought of Robert Godwin Sr.[4] In 2017, Godwin was murdered in Cleveland, Ohio, and initial reports indicated that the attacker streamed it on Facebook Live, at the time a relatively new feature[5] of the social network. Facebook later clarified that the graphic video was uploaded after the event[6], but the incident called public attention to the risks of livestreaming violence. In the wake of Godwin's murder, I recommended that Facebook Live broadcasts be time-delayed[7], at least for Facebook users who had told the company they were under 18. That way, adult users would have an opportunity to flag inappropriate content before children were exposed to it. </p><p>Facebook Live has broadcast killings[8], as well as other serious crimes such as sexual assault, torture and child abuse[9]. Though the company has hired more than 3,000 additional human content moderators[10], Facebook is not any better at keeping horrifying violence from streaming live online without any filter or warning for users. In the 24 hours after the New Zealand massacre, 1.5 million videos and images of the killings[11] were uploaded to Facebook's servers, the company announced. Facebook highlighted the fact that 1.2 million of them 'were blocked at upload[12].' However, as a social media researcher and educator[13], I heard that as an admission that 300,000 videos and images of a mass murder passed through its automated systems and were visible on the platform. The company recently issued some analytic details and noted that fewer than 200 people viewed[14] the livestream of the massacre, and that surprisingly, no users reported it to Facebook until after it ended. These details make painfully clear how dependent Facebook is on users to flag harmful content. They also suggest that people don't know how to report inappropriate content - or don't have confidence the company will act on the complaint. The video that remained after the livestream ended was viewed nearly 4,000 times - which doesn't include copies of the video[15] uploaded to other sites and to Facebook by other users. It's unclear how many of the people who saw it were minors; youth as young as 13 are allowed to set up Facebook accounts and could have encountered unfiltered footage of murderous hatred. It's past time for the company to step up and fulfill the promise its founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, made two years ago, after Godwin's murder: 'We will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening[16].' Play Video[17]  Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses the murder of Robert Godwin Sr.  A simple time-delay In the television industry, short time-delays of a few seconds are typical[18] during broadcasts of live events. That time allows a moderator to review the content and confirm that it's appropriate for a broad audience. Facebook relies on users as moderators, and some livestreams may not have a large audience like TV, so its delay would need to be longer, perhaps a few minutes. Only then would enough adult users have screened it and had the chance to report its content. Major users, including publishers and corporations, could be permitted to livestream directly after completing a training course. Facebook could even let people request a company moderator[19] for upcoming livestreams. Facebook has not yet taken this relatively simple step - and the reason is clear. Time-delays took hold in TV only because broadcasting regulators penalized broadcasters[20] for airing inappropriate content during live shows. There is effectively no regulation[21] for social media companies; they change only in pursuit of profits[22] or to minimize public outcry[23]. Whether and how to regulate social media is a political question, but many U.S. politicians have developed deep ties with platforms like Facebook[24]. Some have relied on social media to collect donations, target supporters with advertising and help them get elected[25]. Once in office, they continue to use social media to communicate with supporters[26] in hopes of getting reelected. Federal agencies also use social media to communicate with the public and influence people's opinions[27] - even in violation of U.S. law[28]. In my view, Facebook's role as a tool to gain, keep and spread political power makes politicians far less likely to rein it in. US regulation isn't coming soon Congress has not yet taken any meaningful action to regulate social media companies. Despite strong statements from politicians and even calls for hearings about social media in response to the New Zealand attack[29], U.S. regulators aren't likely to lead the way. European Union officials[30] are handling much of the work, especially around privacy[31]. New Zealand's government has stepped up, too, banning the livestream video[32] of the mosque massacre, meaning anyone who shares it could face up to NZ$10,000 in fines and 14 years in prison[33]. At least two people have already been arrested[34] for sharing it online[35]. Facebook could - and should - act now Much of the discussion about regulating social media has considered using anti-trust and monopoly laws[36] to force the enormous technology giants like Facebook to break up into smaller separate companies. But if it happens at all, that will be very difficult - breaking up AT...asted a decade[37], from the 1974 lawsuit to the 1984 launch of the 'Baby Bell' companies. In the interim, there will be many more dangerous and violent incidents people will try to livestream. Facebook should evaluate its products' potential for misuse[38] and discontinue them if the effects are harmful to society. No child should ever see the sort of 'raw and visceral content[39]' that has been produced on Facebook Live - including mass murder. I don't think adult users should be exposed to witnessing such heinous acts either, as studies have shown that viewing graphic violence has health risks[40], such as post-traumatic stress. That's why I'm no longer recommending just a livestream delay for adolescent users - it was an appeal to protect children, when more major platform changes are unlikely. But all people deserve better and safe social media. I'm now calling on Mark Zuckerberg to shut down Facebook Live in the interest of public health and safety. In my view, that feature should be restored only if the company can prove to the public - and to regulators - that its design is safer. Handling livestreaming safely includes having more than enough professional content moderators to handle the workload. Those workers also must have appropriate access to mental health support[41] and safe working environments, so that even Facebook employees and contractors are not unduly scarred by brutal violence posted online.

I'm friday/Shutterstock.com[1] Jennifer Grygiel[2], Syracuse University[3] When word broke that the massacre in New Zealand was livestreamed on Facebook, I immediately thought of Robert Godwin Sr.[4] In 2017, Godwin was murdered in Cleveland, Ohio, and initial reports indicated that the attacker streamed it on Facebook Live, at the time a relatively new feature[5] of the social network. Facebook later clarified that the graphic video was uploaded after the event[6], but the incident called public attention to the risks of livestreaming violence. In the wake of Godwin's murder, I recommended that Facebook Live broadcasts be time-delayed[7], at least for Facebook users who had told the company they were under 18. That way, adult users would have an opportunity to flag inappropriate content before children were exposed to it. </p><p>Facebook Live has broadcast killings[8], as well as other serious crimes such as sexual assault, torture and child abuse[9]. Though the company has hired more than 3,000 additional human content moderators[10], Facebook is not any better at keeping horrifying violence from streaming live online without any filter or warning for users. In the 24 hours after the New Zealand massacre, 1.5 million videos and images of the killings[11] were uploaded to Facebook's servers, the company announced. Facebook highlighted the fact that 1.2 million of them 'were blocked at upload[12].' However, as a social media researcher and educator[13], I heard that as an admission that 300,000 videos and images of a mass murder passed through its automated systems and were visible on the platform. The company recently issued some analytic details and noted that fewer than 200 people viewed[14] the livestream of the massacre, and that surprisingly, no users reported it to Facebook until after it ended. These details make painfully clear how dependent Facebook is on users to flag harmful content. They also suggest that people don't know how to report inappropriate content - or don't have confidence the company will act on the complaint. The video that remained after the livestream ended was viewed nearly 4,000 times - which doesn't include copies of the video[15] uploaded to other sites and to Facebook by other users. It's unclear how many of the people who saw it were minors; youth as young as 13 are allowed to set up Facebook accounts and could have encountered unfiltered footage of murderous hatred. It's past time for the company to step up and fulfill the promise its founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, made two years ago, after Godwin's murder: 'We will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening[16].'[embedded content]Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses the murder of Robert Godwin Sr. A simple time-delayIn the television industry, short time-delays of a few seconds are typical[17] during broadcasts of live events. That time allows a moderator to review the content and confirm that it's appropriate for a broad audience. Facebook relies on users as moderators, and some livestreams may not have a large audience like TV, so its delay would need to be longer, perhaps a few minutes. Only then would enough adult users have screened it and had the chance to report its content. Major users, including publishers and corporations, could be permitted to livestream directly after completing a training course. Facebook could even let people request a company moderator[18] for upcoming livestreams. Facebook has not yet taken this relatively simple step - and the reason is clear. Time-delays took hold in TV only because broadcasting regulators penalized broadcasters[19] for airing inappropriate content during live shows. There is effectively no regulation[20] for social media companies; they change only in pursuit of profits[21] or to minimize public outcry[22]. Whether and how to regulate social media is a political question, but many U.S. politicians have developed deep ties with platforms like Facebook[23]. Some have relied on social media to collect donations, target supporters with advertising and help them get elected[24]. Once in office, they continue to use social media to communicate with supporters[25] in hopes of getting reelected. Federal agencies also use social media to communicate with the public and influence people's opinions[26] - even in violation of U.S. law[27]. In my view, Facebook's role as a tool to gain, keep and spread political power makes politicians far less likely to rein it in.US regulation isn't coming soonCongress has not yet taken any meaningful action to regulate social media companies. Despite strong statements from politicians and even calls for hearings about social media in response to the New Zealand attack[28], U.S. regulators aren't likely to lead the way. European Union officials[29] are handling much of the work, especially around privacy[30]. New Zealand's government has stepped up, too, banning the livestream video[31] of the mosque massacre, meaning anyone who shares it could face up to NZ$10,000 in fines and 14 years in prison[32]. At least two people have already been arrested[33] for sharing it online[34].Facebook could - and should - act nowMuch of the discussion about regulating social media has considered using anti-trust and monopoly laws[35] to force the enormous technology giants like Facebook to break up into smaller separate companies. But if it happens at all, that will be very difficult - breaking up AT...asted a decade[36], from the 1974 lawsuit to the 1984 launch of the 'Baby Bell' companies. In the interim, there will be many more dangerous and violent incidents people will try to livestream. Facebook should evaluate its products' potential for misuse[37] and discontinue them if the effects are harmful to society. No child should ever see the sort of 'raw and visceral content[38]' that has been produced on Facebook Live - including mass murder. I don't think adult users should be exposed to witnessing such heinous acts either, as studies have shown that viewing graphic violence has health risks[39], such as post-traumatic stress. That's why I'm no longer recommending just a livestream delay for adolescent users - it was an appeal to protect children, when more major platform changes are unlikely. But all people deserve better and safe social media. I'm now calling on Mark Zuckerberg to shut down Facebook Live in the interest of public health and safety. In my view, that feature should be restored only if the company can prove to the public - and to regulators - that its design is safer. Handling livestreaming safely includes having more than enough professional content moderators to handle the workload. Those workers also must have appropriate access to mental health support[40] and safe working environments, so that even Facebook employees and contractors are not unduly scarred by brutal violence posted online.

The extension of his H1B visa was due to expire about two weeks later, on Nov. 3, 2000. But his attention was not focused where most of high-tech's was--on whether the caps on H1B visas would be raised--but on other lesser known provisions included in the bill. These details would determine whether he could legally remain in this country with his wife, another H1B holder.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The clock was running out on me,\" says Devarakonda. \"If the law hadn't passed, I would've had to leave the country.\"</p><p>Luckily for him and other Indian immigrants, he'll be able to stay for at least another year. The high-tech industry and H1B visa holders were thrilled with legislation passed last fall that increases the cap on the number of H1B visas from 115,000 to 195,000 annually for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. But little mention was made of some other provisions of the law designed to help existing H1B immigrants maintain legal status while awaiting green cards.</p><p>Among the provisions included in the new law are extending the time H1B holders can stay if they meet certain qualifications, expanding the number of green cards available to H1B holders and allowing H1B holders to change jobs without losing their place in the queue for receiving a green card. Without these changes, more than 300,000 H1B holders would be forced to leave the country by 2003, according to Shailesh Gala, president of the Immigrants Support Network, Budd Lake, NJ.</p><p>\"Not everything has been solved, but this is a major, major step,\" says Devarakonda, a senior consultant at ShaktiSoft Inc., a software company in Fremont, CA, and a board member of the Immigrants Support Network.</p><p>Never-ending backlog</p><p>But what the new law doesn't fully address is a growing backlog of H1B immigrants who are awaiting green cards. That number far exceeds the 140,000 green cards available to H1B immigrants each year. And, until the latest legislation, no one country was allowed more than 7% of that total. Since the H1B program was created, there has been a steady stream of immigrants moving to the United States to fill high-tech positions. The initial H1B visa allows the worker to stay for three years, but it is typically extended to six years. There are now roughly 420,000 H1B immigrants in the United States, according to Rick Swartz, president of Swartz &amp; Associates Inc., a political consulting company in Washington, DC. Other estimates put the number as high as 460,000. Now that the country will allow 195,000 new H1B holders in each year, by 2003 there will probably be at least 1 million H1B holders here. But that's assuming the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) doesn't force some of them to return to their native countries. Does this make sense for the high-tech industry?</p><p>\"It's fool-hearty to take the best and brightest,\" and then send them home after six years, says Swartz, a lawyer who has championed immigration, civil and human rights for more than 25 years. His consultancy does not lobby, per se, but rather helps groups to organize effectively so that they can do their own lobbying.</p><p>Swartz helped the Immigrants Support Network get started in November 1998. The group had a membership of 6,000 to 7,000, \"but they had no presence in Washington,\" he says. The group was founded at least partly in reaction to the H1B legislation passed that year that raised the caps to 115,000 but did nothing to help current H1B holders attain green cards faster. The group was frustrated that the INS' processing of green cards, which used to take one to two years, was no taking, in many cases, as long as five years, says Gala. As the cap on the level of H1B cards has been raised, the agency has been overwhelmed by the number of people applying for green cards. There are some 900,000 immigrants currently awaiting green cards, although the INS doesn't break out the number for H1B holders, specifically, according to Eyleen Schmidt, an INS spokeswoman. The problem was that immigrants' H1B visas were expiring before they were granted green cards, and thus they were being forced to leave the country.</p><p>Swartz helped the group organize, plan their political strategy and build their membership. He helped them get their proposals included in la t year's H1B legislation.</p><p>Lives on hold</p><p>\"Your life is basically on hold in a filing cabinet somewhere at the INS,\" says Gala, who works for Comprehensive Designers Inc., a consulting company in Budd Lake, NJ. He came to the States on an H1B visa in May 1995. In October 1996, he applied for a green card. Because of the long bureaucratic delays and the backlog at various agencies, including the Labor Department and the INS, he still does not have it and doesn't know when he will. \"It's been a long four and a half years,\" he says.</p><p>The problem is the worst for H1B visa holders from India. They make up more than 43% of all H1B holders. The INS is allowed to grant up to 140,000 green cards to all employment-based visa holders each year. However, until last fall's legislation passed, only 7%, or 9,800 green cards, of the total could go to immigrants from any one country, whether it be India or Luxembourg.</p><p>But even with the new legislation, a bigger and more difficult problem looms: implementation. The Department of Labor and the INS re infamously slow in implementing regulations. For example, the DOL just recently issued regulations implementing the H1B legislation passed back in 1998, which raised the cap from 65,000 to 115,000, says Sheela Murthy, managing attorney at the law firm of Sheela Murthy P.C., Owings Mills, MD, which specializes in immigration law. (Murthy, herself a native of India, went through the H1B and green card process, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1998.) And the regulations that the DOL issued to implement the 1998 legislation seem in some instances a direct contradiction to the October 2000 legislation, she notes. For example, the 1998 legislation said nothing about companies that were involved with mergers and acquisitions, but the DOL regs say that the new entity must assume all responsibility for meeting the H1B requirements. In contrast, the 2000 legislation states that the new entity does not bear this responsibility. So, which guidance are immigration lawyers and their clients supposed to follow? \"We're really not sure anymore,\" says Murthy.</p><p>The INS is even pernicious in its approach, say some. For example, the legislation increased the filing fee for an H1B visa from $610 to $1,110, and that was implemented in December. Yet, as of mid-January, it still had not come out with clear plans to implement the other parts of the law, says Gala. \"It is partial in the way it is implementing these regulations,\" he says. What's more, immigration proponents don't like the early signs of how the INS is interpreting the new legislation. For example, the INS could interpret the law to mean that its provisions apply only to those immigrants who've filed for a green card on or after the date legislation was passed--Oct. 17, 2000. If that's true, then \"that doesn't help the 300,000 that have been waiting all this time, says Gala.</p><p>INS Spokeswoman Eyleen Schmidt says that's not true. The agency's understanding is that the provisions of the law apply to all H1B holders, regardless of when they applied.</p><p>More work, not much more funding</p><p>Although management at DOL and INS has been criticized for many of the delays, it's not entirely the bureaucracies' fault. Already short of funds and unable to keep up with current applications, the agencies were not granted much in additional funding to handle the huge increase in the visa caps. The 1998 legislation added an additional $500 to the $110 H1B application filing fee, most of which was to go to the DOL to fund training programs in high tech for U.S. workers. Only 1% of that fee was set aside to help the INS handle the increase in applications and processing. In last year's legislation, that fee was raised to $1,110, and 4% was directed to help the INS handle the increase. Is that adequate? \"We're hoping,\" says Schmidt. She says the money will be used to improve the agency's computer system, hire more people to process applications, and perhaps develop a system whereby applications could be handled electronically.</p><p>However, given the change in administration, it's doubtful that any of these changes will be enacted swiftly. For example, one of the first things the Bush Administration did was put a 60-day freeze on implementing any new regulations, says Schmidt. Add that to the historically slow pace of these agencies, and the possibility that the new administration might want to make changes, and it's anyone's guess when and in what form these regulations will come out.</p><p>What's more, there are no politically powerful folks pushing for a reform of the system. There is no consensus among high-tech companies to push for it, says Swartz. Some companies \"get it,\" he says, while he believes that other companies may want to keep the program as is in order to keep their foreign employees \"under their thumb.\" Although the Immigrants Support Network's leadership has talked to some high-tech companies and found that some support its goals in theory, no company has come forth with financial support for the group, says Swartz.</p><p>They should, he says. After all, these reforms are in the best interests of U.S. companies, too, which should want to keep these workers after they've invested the time, energy and money in training them. Although Intel Corp. has not lost any of its H1Bs due to the delays, it has had to send several of them back overseas to await processing, according to Jennifer Verdery, a government relations representative for Intel in Washington, DC. That's an expense most companies would want to avoid.</p><p>Cautious lobbying</p><p>But lobbyists know that the best way to attain success is to focus on just one issue, notes Swartz--in this case it was raising the cap on the number of visas. Companies also tend to focus on their short-term needs rather than long-term, complicated problems, he adds. In addition, immigration is such a controversial issue that pressing for this kind of reform would raise the ire of anti-immigration forces in Congress, such as Lamar Smith, R-TX, chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee, who could have torpedoed the entire law.</p><p>High-tech lobbyists admit as much. \"Some of these guys are under the impression we can wave a magic wand and make this problem go away,\" says one lobbyist. \"The DOL and INS are simply hopelessly overwhelmed.\"</p><p>Thom Stohler, director of workforce policy at the American Electronics Association, Washington, DC, thinks the new law goes a long way to alleviate the problems of H1B holders. And the tech industry would like to push for broader immigration reform--\"the country is not going to suffer if we are overrun by smart people... high-tech companies hire H1Bs because they want them and they want to keep them,\" he says. However, the broader reform \"will be a huge process that will involve many people and will be quite messy, politically,\" Stohler adds. \"This is going to be a highly controversial issue,\" especially if the economy turns south, he notes.</p><p>What's more, some high-tech lobbyists aren't sure they need to press on this issue. The Information Technology Association of America holds that there is only a small percentage of H1B workers--perhaps only 25%--that go on to get green cards, says Harris Miller, president of the Arlington, VA-based trade group. He's not heard much on the issue from his members, and so the ITAA isn't making immigration reform a big issue on its agenda. In addition, \"to assume that the policy agendas of the H1B holders and their employers are congruent is not a safe assumption,\" he points out.</p><p>Without the big, tech-company lobby, there's little pressure to do anything. \"[The Immigrant Support Network] has virtually no capacity to continue lobbying the INS to implement the regulations fairly,\" says Swartz. According to Gala, the immigration group's budget last year was $80,000, derived primarily from contributions of members.</p><p>In addition, it's hard to lobby support for a group whose members are not even U.S. citizens. \"But we are taxpayers,\" notes Gala. He estimates that H1B holders pay about $400 million in taxes a year.</p><p>Impossible wish list?</p><p>What additional reforms does th Immigrants Support Network, which now has almost 20,000 members, want?</p><p>* Immigration law should be simplified and clarified. The U.S. government should decide whether it wants H1B immigrants to stay only for a limited time, or if it wants them to become permanent then it should give the green cards promptly, says Gala. \"Tell us one way or the other, but don't leave us in this hanging state,\" he says. He believes that an immigrant who has worked in this country for four years should automatically receive a green card.</p><p>* H1B holders still are not allowed to leave the country without permission from the INS, called \"advanced parole,\" says Devarakonda. is permission can take months to get. \"What if somebody dies back in India?\" he asks. The group would like to eliminate this restriction.</p><p>* The group also wants to work with the DOL and INS so that the regulations are implemented fairly and thus help solve the problems they were intended by Congress to solve.</p><p>The group could file a class-action lawsuit. \"This is available to us, but we don't want to do that,\" says Gala. In general, says Devarakonda, the group's aim is to get rid of all the bureaucratic hurdles and delays that deny immigrants any control over their future, or even any certainty of their future options in life. Today, that control is in the hands of employers and th INS.</p><p>\"The umbilical cord has to be broken,\" he says. \"We've done nothing wrong. We come here as highly qualified professionals, but our legal status is not in our hands.\"</p><p>Tam Harbert is ELECTRONIC BUSINESS' national editor in Washington, DC.</p><p><table><title>H1B PETITIONS APPROVED BY COUNTRY OF BIRTH</title><tgroup cols=\"3\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"336\"/><colspec align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry/><entry>October 1999 to February 2000</entry></row><row><entry>Country</entry><entry>Total</entry><entry>% of total</entry></row><row><entry>India</entry><entry>34,381</entry><entry>43</entry></row><row><entry>China</entry><entry>7,987</entry><entry>10</entry></row><row><entry>Canada</entry><entry>3,143</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry>United Kingdom</entry><entry>2,598</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col1\">SOURCE:U.S.IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Should they stay or should they go?</p><p>THE H1B VISA PROGRAM remains a political lightening rod that sparks debate. On the one side are high-tech companies, arguing that the program is critical if they are to find qualified workers to keep their companies running. On the other side are groups like American Engineering Association, Fort Worth, TX, who charge that companies simply use the H1B program as a way to import cheap labor rather than hiring older, more expensive American programmers.</p><p>There has been fraud in the H1B program, most admit, but it's generally been among the \"job shops\" -- consulting companies that farm out H1B workers to tech companies, says Rick Swartz, president of Swartz &amp; Associates Inc. \"As a category, I look at them as the bad apples\" of the H1B program, he says.</p><p>As for holding wages down, a recent National Research Council report found that the H1B program is \"large enough to exert a non-negligible moderating force that keeps wages from rising as fast as might be expected in a tight labor marker.\" Although there have been episodes in which H1B visa holders have been exploited, those cases are not the norm, says MuraliKrishna Devarakonda, a Java programmer here on an H1B visa. Some employers may pay H1Bs less than the prevailing wage, he says, but he doesn't blame them. \"It's a capitalistic system,\" he says. \"When was the last time you got a raise from your employer without asking for it?\"</p><p>The problem is part cultural, Devarakonda explains. Indians are taught to be humble. \"We don't know how to beat our [own] drum,\" he says. \"Employers exploit anyone who is shy or can't negotiate well for themselves.\" Until the recent legislation, employers could use an H1B holder's tentative green card status to hold him hostage, but, now, under certain conditions, that's no longer true.</p><p>If there is exploitation, Devarakonda believes it can be eliminated by further reform of the H1B program. \"The system is exploitative. It's not the employer or the government that's exploitative,\" he says. \"Let's end the debate over whether employers are exploiting H1Bs. Let's get rid of any incentive to exploit.\" By that he means simply allowing highly qualified professionals from outside the United States to come in, based on their merits, and apply for jobs. If the immigrant gets the job, fine. If not, he will go back home.</p><p>Swartz believes immigration is good for the U.S. economy. \"The lifeblood of America is new immigrants,\" he says. \"In a global economy ... the story of America is becoming more and more the story of immigration,\" he believes. \"The H1B story is part of a bigger story about the future of America,\" he adds.</p><p>The rocky road to a green card</p><p>HERE ARE THE TYPICAL STEPS immigrants and their employers take to get H1B visas,\u00a0\u00a0according to Sheela Murthy, managing attorney at Sheela Murthy P.C., a law firm in Owings Mills, MD, that specializes in immigration law, and an INS spokeswoman Eyleen Schmidt.</p><p>1 The employer files with the Department of Labor (DOL) for Labor Certification on behalf of the employee. The application must provide documentation showing that the employer cannot fill the job with a permanent resident and that it will pay the \"prevailing wage\" for the job to be filled by the immigrant. Under U.S. law, this process should take no more than seven business days, but it sometimes takes as long as two months, according to Murthy.</p><p>2 Once the application is approved by DOL, the employer files an H1B application and fees (now $1,110) with its regional INS office. The application typically sits at the INS office from three to six months, notes Murthy. The employer or employee can pay an additional $1,000 \"expedition fee,\" but no time frame for expedition has been set by the INS. \"There is zero accountability for this,\" says Murthy.</p><p>3 If the three-year H1B application is approved, the employee has typically already used at least six months of the three years getting the paperwork filed to come into the country.</p><p>The cost of this process including application fees, legal fees and, if the H1B applicant is not a graduate of a U.S. university, something called a \"credentials evaluation fee,\" can run up to $5,000, notes Murthy. Although the DOL says that the employer should pay all fees, in reality the employer often requires the applicant to pay, she says.</p><p><table><title>TOP USERS OF H1B VISAS</title><subtitle>October 1999 to February 2000</subtitle><tgroup cols=\"2\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"400\"/><colspec align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry>Company</entry><entry>Number</entry></row><row><entry>Motorola Inc.</entry><entry>618</entry></row><row><entry>Oracle Corp.</entry><entry>455</entry></row><row><entry>Cisco Systems Inc.</entry><entry>398</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"col2\" namest=\"col1\">IGate Capital Corp.</entry></row><row><entry>(formerly Mastech Corp.)</entry><entry>389</entry></row><row><entry>Intel Corp.</entry><entry>367</entry></row><row><entry>Microsoft Corp.</entry><entry>362</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"col2\" namest=\"col1\">SOURCE: U.S IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>PROVISIONS OF THE 2000 H1B LAW:</p><p>*\u00a0\u00a0Raises the cap on H1B visas from 115,000 to 195,000 per year for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003.

Getting a bit whiffy? Apparently sticking them in the freezer will kill off those stinky bacteria.</p><p>To wash or not is not the only question at the two Levi's stores in San Francisco. If you're wearing a pair of the most famous jeans in the world, take a look at one of your buttons. It's likely to say 'Levi Strauss &amp; CoSF. Cal': it was here, in 1873, that a German immigrant struck gold with denim while others were prospecting for the shiny stuff in them thar hills that surround the city.</p><p>As a result, the Levi's worldwide HQ and museum are here and there's a bewildering array of special editions on offer, as well as the chance to try out innovations before they go on sale in the rest of the world. Choose from vintage unwashed 501s painstakingly copied from the styles of eight different eras, from the late 1800s to the 1960s; buy special-edition handstitched 511s; or pick up a pair of Curve ID jeans, for which women are measured in four different places to find the perfect booty fit.</p><p>Want something altered? In-house tailors will hem, taper, add or remove belt loops and even stencil your name in the jeans. And along the way, someone like Voy will be on hand to dish out pop culture titbits such as: 'See these 1966 501s? They were Bob Dylan's favourites.' Levi's sits well beside San Francisco's other icons - the Golden Gate Bridge; the tourist trolley buses that groan up and down the city's huge hills; the spooky cells of Alcatraz; and burgeoning Chinatown - but it also illustrates the rich seam of innovation that courses through the city.</p><p>Take the Academy of Sciences - the equivalent of London's Aquarium, National History Museum and Planetarium rolled into one. Its new home in Golden Gate Park is constructed from material from its old one, the 'living roof' is covered in 1.7million plants that help to cool it in the heat and the walls are packed with thousands of pairs of jeans to provide insulation. When one of its penguins lost its feathers and could no longer regulate its own temperature, the Academy constructed an outfit from an old wetsuit that saved its life.</p><p>This innovation is dotted everywhere too, from the big tech boys that make nearby Silicon Valley their working home to the delicate flavours of Jamie Oliver's favourite Chinese restaurant, Feng, and the 21st Amendment Microbrewery, where a wheat beer flavoured with watermelon has become an award-winning smash. The bizarre thing about all this innovation is that hardly anyone actually comes from San Francisco - but so many adopt the city as their own.</p><p>'You hardly ever meet people from San Francisco,' says Sonia Bercel, who recently moved from London, 'but people are passionate about living here, they love it. Everyone is an advocate of their own neighbourhood and every neighbourhood is amazing.' The attitude of these surrogate San Franciscans is also deliciously laid-back. While in New York people seem to be in such a rush to get somewhere, San Franciscans seem to know where they are going and are comfortable getting there at their own pace. There can be few places in the world where the owner of the city's leading menswear outlet, also on Union Square, takes his pet to work every day. But sartorial Wilkes 'menswear for the bold conservative' Bashford and his daschund, Duchess, open their downtown store together every morning.</p><p>IT may be that the relaxed air is a carry-over from the hippy era of the late 1960s.</p><p>'You can literally smell San Francisco on the air,' says Ady, my guide on an excellent Segway tour of the Golden Gate Park, while pointing out one of its official '50 places to make love', detailed in a book written by a jogger who fell in love with the park in the early 1980s. 'April 20 is a huge stoners' holiday here,' continues Ady. 'It comes from the fact the police call sign for someone smoking weed is \"a 420\".' The park was one of the focal points of the summer of love in the 1960s - though in typical San Francisco style, it all actually kicked off in January rather than June. (Perhaps they took Mark Twain's quip about the famously cold weather - 'the coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco' - too literally.) The epicentre of hippy era was a few blocks from here in the neighbourhood known as the Haight. Among the high-end boutiques that now line the streets, you can find a throwback to those tie-dyed, acid-dropping days in a range of trippy murals and the odd smoke shop such as Pipe Dream or The Love of Ganesha - marijuana is legal with a doctor's prescription and I'm told by one local that it's not hard to find a willing quack to help out.</p><p>A little up from the corner of Haight and Ashbury streets - the ground zero of hippydom - lies either the cleverest or worst buy in San Fran real estate.</p><p>The unremarkable three-storey clapboard house at 710 Ashbury is where the Grateful Dead, the US rock band led by Jerry Garcia, set up home for two years from 1966.</p><p>As I join the steady flow of tourists queuing to get my photo taken by the gate, I think about those heady days but I can't help but wonder\u2026 just how often did the band's legendary leader wash his jeans?

You decide on the route, which can include running over the Golden Gate Bridge or down Lombard Street - the crookedest street in the world, famous for appearing in the comic car chase in the film What's Up, Doc? Isgar's commentary on the way is excellent but make sure you train before taking him on: there are 43 hills in the city and some of the streets are super steep.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.a4interactive.com/sfruntours\">www.a4interactive.com/sfruntours</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Golden age: San Francisco's iconic bridge (left); the corner of Haight and Ashbury streets, focus of 1967's Summer of Love (top); a worker at Levi's (above); and Alcatraz Island, home to the infamous prison, which closed in 1963 (right)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>James Ellis tours San Francisco by Segway</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METLON-57357323</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METLON2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5536-0NC1-JCC9-V26B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335727</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1144\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Getting a bit whiffy? Apparently sticking them in the freezer will kill off those stinky bacteria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To wash or not is not the only question at the two Levi's stores in San Francisco. If you're wearing a pair of the most famous jeans in the world, take a look at one of your buttons. It's likely to say 'Levi Strauss &amp; CoSF. Cal': it was here, in 1873, that a German immigrant struck gold with denim while others were prospecting for the shiny stuff in them thar hills that surround the city.</p><p>As a result, the Levi's worldwide HQ and museum are here and there's a bewildering array of special editions on offer, as well as the chance to try out innovations before they go on sale in the rest of the world. Choose from vintage unwashed 501s painstakingly copied from the styles of eight different eras, from the late 1800s to the 1960s; buy special-edition handstitched 511s; or pick up a pair of Curve ID jeans, for which women are measured in four different places to find the perfect booty fit.</p><p>Want something altered? In-house tailors will hem, taper, add or remove belt loops and even stencil your name in the jeans. And along the way, someone like Voy will be on hand to dish out pop culture titbits such as: 'See these 1966 501s? They were Bob Dylan's favourites.'</p><p>Levi's sits well beside San Francisco's other icons - the Golden Gate Bridge; the tourist trolley buses that groan up and down the city's huge hills; the spooky cells of Alcatraz; and burgeoning Chinatown - but it also illustrates the rich seam of innovation that courses through the city.</p><p>Take the Academy of Sciences - the equivalent of London's Aquarium, National History Museum and Planetarium rolled into one. Its new home in Golden Gate Park is constructed from material from its old one, the 'living roof' is covered in 1.7million plants that help to cool it in the heat and the walls are packed with thousands of pairs of jeans to provide insulation.</p><p>When one of its penguins lost its feathers and could no longer regulate its own temperature, the Academy constructed an outfit from an old wetsuit that saved its life.</p><p>This innovation is dotted everywhere too, from the big tech boys that make nearby Silicon Valley their working home to the delicate flavours of Jamie Oliver's favourite Chinese restaurant, Feng, and the 21st Amendment Microbrewery, where a wheat beer flavoured with watermelon has become an award-winning smash. The bizarre thing about all this innovation is that hardly anyone actually comes from San Francisco - but so many adopt the city as their own.</p><p>'You hardly ever meet people from San Francisco,' says Sonia Bercel, who recently moved from London, 'but people are passionate about living here, they love it.</p><p>Everyone is an advocate of their own neighbourhood and every neighbourhood is amazing.'</p><p>The attitude of these surrogate San Franciscans is also deliciously laid-back. While in New York people seem to be in such a rush to get somewhere, San Franciscans seem to know where they are going and are comfortable getting there at their own pace. There can be few places in the world where the owner of the city's leading menswear outlet, also on Union Square, takes his pet to work every day. But sartorial Wilkes 'menswear for the bold conservative' Bashford and his daschund, Duchess, open their downtown store together every morning.</p><p>IT may be that the relaxed air is a carry-over from the hippy era of the late 1960s.</p><p>'You can literally smell San Francisco on the air,' says Ady, my guide on an excellent Segway tour of the Golden Gate Park, while pointing out one of its official '50 places to make love', detailed in a book written by a jogger who fell in love with the park in the early 1980s. 'April 20 is a huge stoners' holiday here,' continues Ady. 'It comes from the fact the police call sign for someone smoking weed is \"a 420\".'</p><p>The park was one of the focal points of the summer of love in the 1960s - though in typical San Francisco style, it all actually kicked off in January rather than June. (Perhaps they took Mark Twain's quip about the famously cold weather - 'the coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco' - too literally.)</p><p>The epicentre of hippy era was a few blocks from here in the neighbourhood known as the Haight. Among the high-end boutiques that now line the streets, you can find a throwback to those tie-dyed, acid-dropping days in a range of trippy murals and the odd smoke shop such as Pipe Dream or The Love of Ganesha - marijuana is legal with a doctor's prescription and I'm told by one local that it's not hard to find a willing quack to help out.</p><p>A little up from the corner of Haight and Ashbury streets - the ground zero of hippydom - lies either the cleverest or worst buy in San Fran real estate.</p><p>The unremarkable three-storey clapboard house at 710 Ashbury is where the Grateful Dead, the US rock band led by Jerry Garcia, set up home for two years from 1966.</p><p>As I join the steady flow of tourists queuing to get my photo taken by the gate, I think about those heady days but I can't help but wonder\u2026 just how often did the band's legendary leader wash his jeans?</p><p>Virgin Holidays (Tel: 0844 557 3865.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.virginholidays.co.uk\">www.virginholidays.co.uk</url>) has five nights in San Francisco at the Hotel Kabuki from \u00a3775pp. Price includes return Virgin Atlantic flights from Heathrow to San Francisco and transfers.

COAST TECH BANKING, MORGAN STANLEY: Good morning, everyone. I'm Paul Kwan from Morgan Stanley. Welcome to the Teladoc HealthLivongo fireside chat. Before we get started, I do have to read a quick disclaimer. Please note that this webcast is for Morgan Stanley's clients and appropriate Morgan Stanley employees only. Webcast is not for members of the press. If you are a member of the press, please disconnect and reach out separately. For important disclosures, please see the Morgan Stanley research disclosure website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures\">www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures</url>. If you have any questions, please reach out to a Morgan Stanley sales representative.</p><p>And with that, we'll get started. We're very excited to have with us the teams from Teladoc Health and Livongo: Jason Gorevic, CEO; Mala Murthy, CFO; Glen Tullman, Livongo, Chairman -- Executive Chairman and Founder; and Dr. Jenny Schneider, President from Livongo.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Maybe just to start off, Jason, this is a really transformative combination. You're going to basically be redefining virtual care and digital health on a global basis. At the same time, both companies have tremendous momentum, right? Two of the fastest-growing companies we're tracking in the public technology and health care markets. Why now? What do you see in the market, and then we'll go to Glen, that kind of made you think this was the right time to pull this off, Jason?</p><p>JASON NATHANIAL GOREVIC, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, TELADOC HEALTH, INC.: Yes. Thanks, Paul, and thanks for having us today. We had set out a strategic road map even before we went public on our IPO road show that included chronic care remote patient monitoring because the vision was always to become the destination for the consumer regardless of their clinical needs. But as we went through the time period from March through June, July, we saw the market accelerate by probably 3 or 4 years over the span of just 3 or 4 months, and consumer adoption rapidly accelerated, provider adoption rapidly accelerated and the role of virtual care in the marketplace accelerated. And you're exactly right. Both companies had tremendous momentum at that time even before the pandemic hit, and then it just accelerated through that time.</p><p>So this was about looking to where the market is now and where it's going and how rapidly it's going to get there. And Glen and I talked about it, and we both had a similar vision for where that was going and how fast it was going to get there. And then it was a question of the complementary nature of the 2 companies coming together at this moment was an opportunity that neither of us could pass up. And then Glen, I don't know if you want to add to that.</p><p>GLEN E. TULLMAN, FOUNDER &amp; EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, LIVONGO HEALTH, INC.: I'd only say that I think both companies do a great job of listening to our clients and to our members. And in both cases, there is a very strong push to say each of you are missing something that's important to complete this whole person experience. So for us, they were saying, we were seeing people call us and who had chronic conditions and saying, \"I need more complex care. I need to talk to a physician.\" In some cases, \"I love your behavior, your digital health entry to behavioral health, but I'd like more.\" And I think Jason was hearing some of those requests on the other side. And when you put them together, it just made sense as we sat together, we said, \"This is a natural fit.\"</p><p>And the ability to put together 2 industry leaders to really create a transformational effect was something that we saw. We could have each become competitors, tried to build it. There are secondary assets out there, but we said this is a once in a -- really once-in-an-industry opportunity. So we took it.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: We're getting some questions around the cross-selling synergies. We'll get to that in a few minutes. But it's been a month since the announcement. Curious for the feedback, again, picking up on that thread, Glen, around what you've heard from your stakeholders today. So whether that's members, partners, physicians, employees, what have you been hearing back from the market in terms of the feedback? Maybe we'll start with you, Jason and go to Dr. Schneider.</p><p>JASON NATHANIAL GOREVIC: Yes, it's interesting. I had a discussion that was regularly scheduled just a couple of days after the announcement with a senior executive at one of the largest health plans. He said, \"Jason, you're building something that's so big and broad, and it's going to be so important that everybody is going to have to work with you.\" Because our clients are going to demand it and our competitors are going to have it and in order to be able to compete in the market, we're going to have to have it as well.</p><p>And it's exactly what Glen said, we listen to our clients. So employers are saying, they are looking for a single destination, a single partner to provide the full breadth of care because there's vendor fatigue out there for all those little point solutions. It's hard. It's not an employer's job or expertise to try to assemble all of those into one seamless experience.</p><p>And so together, we are going to put that together into a single consumer experience with a single front door that has access to all of the clinical capabilities of the 2 organizations. And that's exactly what our clients and members are looking for.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Jenny, do you want to add on anything you're hearing in the marketplace again over the last month?</p><p>JENNIFER SCHNEIDER, PRESIDENT, LIVONGO HEALTH, INC.: Yes. The only -- the other part that I would add to what Jason was sharing. He's right, it's really about experience, really building that holistic experience. So from a member standpoint, Jason shared on his last public earnings call that 60% of their calls were for chronic condition management. We see regularly that our members with chronic conditions have acute needs, maybe ear infection, sore throat. And so it's really delivering on that end-to-end spectrum because you're just a person at the end of the day, and you want the best service, and you want that connected.</p><p>All of this being built on the data layer is incredible. So that not only drives the end member experience, but it drives it from a physician standpoint, too. So now imagine physicians can get to see people outside of the arena where they're not typically following them, have more information and be able to, whether it's acute episodic or chronic, really detail and deliver the exact recommendations that are most useful to that end member or end patient.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Got it. I think we want to take one step back and just go pre COVID. Maybe we'll start with Glen and go to Jason. For those who may not know both companies as well, talk about what was driving the momentum going into pre-COVID times over the past year or 2? And then again, what's been accelerating throughout but more kind of what was driving before? That would be helpful to understand both sides. Maybe Glen, we can go back to you and then to Jason.</p><p>GLEN E. TULLMAN: Sure. I'm happy to. Well, both companies, as we kind of referred to, were growing in excess of 100%. So you had 2 really great growth companies that were already -- people were already adopting digital health. And as we talk to clients, as we talk to members, everyone knew where this was going. They just didn't know how fast it would get there and how impactful it would be.</p><p>And as Jason already mentioned, the pandemic served to accelerate this by -- whether it's 3 to 5 years, whether it's a factor of 10x, whatever metric you want to use, there was a dramatic acceleration. But it was going to happen anyway, and both companies were built to scale. That's really important.</p><p>Now when the pandemic came along, and I'll reference telehealth, there was only one company of all of them out there that was able to manage -- seamlessly manage the increase in scale, and that was Teladoc. And we took notice of that, that there was one clear leader, both in terms of volume, 10 million visits, but also in terms of the ability to seamlessly scale up.</p><p>Our clients noticed that as well, and some of them literally were changing over to Teladoc at that very moment. So that ability to scale, paired with knowing where the market was going, it was already going there. This just accelerated it dramatically as it did in many other industries.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Anything you want to add to that, Jason?</p><p>JASON NATHANIAL GOREVIC: Yes. I mean the momentum from both companies was tremendous. I mean we both had great first quarters before when we only had a couple of weeks of impact from the pandemic. Both companies are seeing similar trends with respect to our clients buying multiple clinical services from us. So that's a really strong indicator of the appetite for a broader array of services and sort of the full credit answer. By putting the 2 companies together, it completes that picture for them.</p><p>And then you saw in the second quarter, from our announcement, 2/3 of our clients buying multi-product solutions from us, again, just sort of speaks to that one partner, one vendor, one consumer experience. And all of that was certainly accelerated.</p><p>One of the things that I think is probably underappreciated is that Livongo got a little bit of a tailwind from -- in the second quarter from the pandemic, but it was already off the charts as the fastest grower in the market. And it may have gotten a little bit more usage, but the impact on Livongo was actually smaller than the impact on Teladoc. As -- with people unable to go into their doctors' offices, they turn to telehealth for the first time. What the 2 companies share is tremendously high Net Promoter Scores with Net Promoter Scores in the mid-60s. Our clients love us. Our members love us. And together, they're going to get even more from that.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Awesome. Maybe we'll go to Mala and then we'll go to the competitive landscape question after that. But Mala, talk about kind of the outlook you've given. You've kind of got the pre-synergy revenue growth of 40% to 45% for 2021 and a CAGR of 30% to 40% growth over the next 3 years. Can you talk about the confidence there in that outlook and kind of what's driving that, Mala?</p><p>MALA MURTHY, CFO, TELADOC HEALTH, INC.: Thanks, Paul. What's driving that is a few things. First of all, as Jason and Glen have talked about quite eloquently, there is tremendous and broad momentum across both businesses. If you again look at the second quarter results that we both posted, our revenue growth was in the range of 85%, Livongo's was well over 100%. So you're talking about 2 very high momentum companies from a revenue growth perspective.</p><p>The second thing I'd say is what's underpinning that revenue growth is high degree of visibility on both sides, right? For those of you who know our business, most of our revenue -- a preponderance of our revenue is subscription revenue, is access revenue, and we have very high visibility around that. As we have talked about in our recent earnings calls, we are seeing tremendous bookings momentum. The amount of bookings we are seeing that are multiple products and services, which fuels revenue growth from an expansion of our PMPM is over 2/3 of our bookings with multiple products.</p><p>So there are a lot of tailwinds that we are seeing in our -- in both our businesses, very strong visit revenue momentum and most importantly, broad-based momentum. As I always say, we are both businesses that are firing on multiple cylinders. It isn't a concentrated revenue growth story. It is a broad-based momentum story. So the broad-based nature fit plus the visibility that people have is what is underpinning our confidence in the momentum ahead.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: We've got a couple of questions in the queue here. Just on the competitive landscape, can you talk about how, again, the combination here is obviously changing the landscape? We had a question around big medical brands, Mayo, Cedars, Cleveland. What competition are they? Maybe, Jason, you can hit that and Glen and Dr. Jenny, you can chime in as well.</p><p>JASON NATHANIAL GOREVIC: Yes. Actually, we provide technology to some of the largest hospital systems, health systems in the country. In fact, I think the last time I looked, we were in 60 of the top 100 hospitals, providing them with technology that enables them to deliver virtual care to their patient populations. We see virtual care as a rising tide. And as the leader in that space, we're going to get an outsized benefit from that.</p><p>With respect to the overall competitive landscape, I think this redefines it completely. I think we've defined a new category in which we exist almost alone because there's nobody else who has anywhere near the breadth of capabilities who can bring that full credit answer to clients and who also operates in all the compliant channels as the leader, whether it's health plans, employers, direct-to-consumer, domestic, international, hospitals and health systems. We're fortunate we've been deliberate about our strategy at approaching all of those entry points for the consumer to become the leader, and this just accelerates it.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Glen, anything to add there?</p><p>GLEN E. TULLMAN: Jenny, I'll let you comment first. You're more expert on this than me.</p><p>JENNIFER SCHNEIDER: Yes. I think what Jason said is exactly right, like we're in this position really to accelerate. And if you think about the combination of virtual care and remote monitoring, that's where the world, as Jason described, gets really exciting because it's not just delivering care services vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis a virtual platform. It's actually being able to do it with the data. And that's something that we've seen rapid growth in our own client base around health systems as well for the exact reason that they're understanding that being able to monitor their patients in the outside world does a couple of things.</p><p>One, it improves overall care, without a doubt, and it also allows everybody to function at the top of their licensure. So you can really focus on it and get the level-5 patients in when they need it. And so it's a win across the ecosystem. And so I do think it's this remote monitoring plus virtual care that is redefining the space altogether.</p><p>GLEN E. TULLMAN: I'll just add one other point and that is people often throw out different names. You listed a few, other people use big tech names. What about Amazon? What about this or that? And as Jason was saying, in most cases, all those names you're listing are customers of at least one of us already. So Amazon is a customer. They love us in terms of using it for their own employees to provide them better clinical and chronic care. They also -- we're partners in development. So you can go to your Alexa and ask about, give me my Livongo blood pressure, give me my Livongo blood sugar number. And if you walk down the path and we're using them, they're using us, so there's a lot of collaboration.</p><p>I think the biggest and best tech companies, the biggest and best health systems all understand that you partner with the best providers. You don't have to try to reinvent everything. Health care is a very big space. So you're going to see partnerships. You're going to see sometimes where the underlying -- I mean, I've been amazed a number of our clients who I didn't know but are using Teladoc already for one or more services. And it makes it easier for us to contract with them because they already have an existing relationship with Teladoc. We just do an addendum. Our contracting just got easier. So lots of opportunity to work together with all those names you talked about.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: That's a great segue to the cross-sell revenue synergies. We've got a bunch of questions there we'll take through in a second. And maybe just to step back for Mala, on the most recently published investor deck, you kind of walked through the targeted revenue synergies. Could you kind of walk through the different buckets there, how that is going to play out over the next 2 to 5 years? And then we'll kind of dig through some of the specific questions the audience has.</p><p>MALA MURTHY: Great. Yes. So as we have talked about, we -- from a revenue synergy standpoint, we expect to achieve a run rate of $500 million of revenue synergies by 2025 and $100 million run rate of revenue synergies by 2022. I would also remind you, we have cost synergies contemplated as well of a run rate of $60 million by 2022.</p><p>When we think about the revenue synergies, the quantified revenue synergies, they really fall into 3 key buckets. Slightly over half of it is coming from cross-sell. The cross-sell synergies essentially are underpinned by the fact that we have fairly limited client overlap, less than 25%. And so that's just an incredible runway for growth from cross-sell to us.</p><p>The second bucket that we have identified is cross referral. So think of a member, an individual who has both access to both Livongo and Teladoc Health and they are coming for a certain condition. And the provider is clearly able to understand the root cause and help them with the other products. So that is cross referral.</p><p>And then the third bucket that we have identified, which is approximately 20% of our total synergies, is international. International is something where both teams are tremendously excited about the possibilities. We have a playbook for international. Our sales teams in international are salivating the prospect of getting Livongo that they are able to sell to our clients. And we have large global clients, financial institutions, et cetera. The one other aspect that we are really excited about with the addition of Livongo is the possibility for us approaching national health care systems. So there's a ton of runway for international.</p><p>The thing that I will also add is, in addition to these quantified opportunities, there are several others that have a lot of promise that we have not really quantified, but we are already together starting to ideate around the possibilities of those. And those include things such as what this could do to our virtual primary care offering, right?</p><p>We have talked a lot about reimagining virtual care, primary care. So that is -- that -- there are possibilities there and really, all about hospital at home. So again, the -- how can we use our hospital and health system as a great distribution opportunity for Livongo as well? So that sort of encapsulates the thinking that we have around revenue synergies.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: (technical difficulty) We have a couple of specific questions just to drill down on that and so -- we have feedback there. One question is on behavioral health and kind of that opportunity there. Can we talk about that? Anyone could jump in, in terms of the combined behavioral health solution, which can be again quite transformative for the ecosystem.</p><p>GLEN E. TULLMAN: Jenny, do you want to take that one?</p><p>JENNIFER SCHNEIDER: Yes, for sure. So thanks for the question. So as we've seen, behavioral health needs in the setting of the pandemic have hugely escalated, and we're really truly only at the tip of the iceberg, I think we all know and believe. And the 2 assets together are -- again, Jason talked about the complementary nature of the 2 companies. And I think this is an area where it's just hugely illustrated in that Livongo has today a digital front end for behavioral health, and it's built a number of modules to allow people to come in and self-select and help direct them to the digital aspects through the combination and ability to escalate that when a provider, a therapist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist is needed is incredibly powerful.</p><p>And what that allows us to do is really scale in a one-to-many and more importantly, in behavioral health, is allow people to access the care that they need and that they want in the place that they want to get that. And so it's the convenience throughout that, that really will drive that experience.</p><p>JASON NATHANIAL GOREVIC: And I -- so I totally agree. And I guess I would just add, that's an area that we're seeing explode in terms of demand and volume as virtual care is the perfect solution for behavioral health. And we all know that every estimate of the market potential there is understated because of pent-up demand due to stigma and access issues that are really addressed by virtual care because we can bring the right therapists, the right digital assets to bear for the consumer on their terms without them having to overcome those stigma and access issues that prevent people from getting the care that they need.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: We had a specific question just to drill down on the cross-sell. Where do we think that's going to land first, get the most adoption early on? Anybody, maybe Jason, you want to hit that one first?</p><p>JASON NATHANIAL GOREVIC: Yes. I think it's in the employer and health plan market. As we look at the populations that we serve, over 70 million people in the U.S. have access to the Teladoc platform and as Mala said, less than 25% client overlap. A lot of those very large clients come from employers directly or through their health plans. And as we've been out talking to the market and talking to our clients, that's where the immediate impact is going to be.</p><p>I think secondarily, you're going to see the impact in the international markets and in the hospital and health system markets. We also are excited about bringing Livongo down into the smaller end of the employer market, which we access through broker channels, and they really haven't historically served. So we see that as another area of opportunity.</p><p>MALA MURTHY: Well, one thing I would add -- sorry, one thing I'd add to that end, we are already together, from an integration standpoint, contemplating those kinds of opportunities. We are already starting to work together on plan. As you probably know, we have a commercial agreement in place, and we are having a fast start when it comes to integration planning to bring the commercial teams together such that we can go after those opportunities quickly.</p><p>GLEN E. TULLMAN: Yes. It's not -- this is not theoretical. It's happening today. The sales teams are working together today under that cross-selling agreement. And as Jason said, they are just tremendously -- they're probably the most excited or maybe our members or clients are, but -- and we're bringing the investment community along.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Got it. A question came in just around regulatory change if we -- once we come out of COVID. So do we think Congress makes changes thereafter we come through this pandemic? Maybe Glen, you're still off mute, so you can jump on that one.</p><p>GLEN E. TULLMAN: I'll just -- well, I want to turn it over quickly, but I'll just say that there's tremendous energy. This is a -- not a political issue. Both -- in fact, it's political in the sense that both parties are trying to grab it and run with it. Everybody wants to take credit for providing telehealth as a general sense to the entire population. Everybody understands it work. We would like to push that along. And I think we are to explain that it's really -- consumer-centric virtual care is what they want. But telehealth is a great entry level in, and then we'll see them add more. And both sides have tremendous enthusiasm.</p><p>Again, the Teladoc team has a great team already in Washington, educating, talking to people. We have a great team as well of Livongo. Those are being combined. We'll have twice the firepower, but there's tremendous enthusiasm.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: If you add that...</p><p>JASON NATHANIAL GOREVIC: Paul, I might just add, the -- you've heard Seema talk about the genie not going back in the bottle. Just yesterday, the NCQA task force on telehealth came out with their recommendation that the regulatory changes that were put in place for the pandemic persist after the pandemic. You've seen CMS say that they'll reimburse through the end of '21, but they're not going backwards. This will become an issue of what's the level of reimbursement, how are they going through the mechanics of it, not -- I don't think it's an if question anymore. It's what exactly do the rigs look like as we come out the other end of '21.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Great. I think we've got just a few more minutes here before we wrap up. Maybe stick with you, Jason. What do you think -- investors maybe aren't as appreciating as much in terms of, again, this transformative combination and outlook for this company. And then -- yes, why don't we still go there with that one?</p><p>JASON NATHANIAL GOREVIC: Yes. I think we took people by surprise a little bit. Where you started, Paul, I think, is really important. Both companies had tremendous momentum. We were both tremendously successful. And so you don't usually see the merger of 2 rapidly growing sort of industry-defining companies at this kind of a time. So I think there was a little bit of surprise.</p><p>Our clients weren't surprised. Our clients were thankful. They were saying this makes 100% sense. This is fantastic. And I think it's hard for the market to react fast enough to an industry redefining combination and the competitive advantage that, that yields and therefore, the opportunity that, that opens up, right?</p><p>I mean Mala talked about virtual primary care. Our ability to now manage whole person cost of care and get the benefits of the impact that we have will open up new economic opportunities that neither company could have really grabbed by themselves. And I think it takes a little bit of sort of forward thinking, leaning into what those opportunities look like and appreciation for how different we are from everyone else in the market. And we've always had a hard time because there have never been any comparables. We probably have to go through that again in order to educate the market about what the opportunity really looks like and the success that we're going to have.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Glen, anything to add there? I think, for sure, this -- yes, the complementary fit here in terms of bringing together best-in-class products, technologies against a global distribution footprint at scale that's got proven scalability really is pretty unique. And we go forward to see how that plays out. Anything else you want to add, Glen, in terms of your thoughts or...</p><p>GLEN E. TULLMAN: I'd just -- I'd say that when the -- Jason talked about surprising the market, and I think that everybody we've talked to has said this was a really bold move. They understand that people needed it. But if we go back to when we came out and went public, a lot of people didn't quite understand what is Livongo. Is it strips and meters? Is it coaching? Is it really understanding how to use data science? Is it -- are you a data science company? And this idea of applied health signals was brand new. And so you saw -- painfully, we all saw -- initially, they didn't know. Tech investors didn't know, the health care investors, they didn't know what this new thing was. And then as people started to understand, wow, this is long-term recurring revenue, this is stable, the clients really love it. Then they came along and we see what happened.</p><p>I think the same is going to happen here. There's already a positive reception. But as people start to look at the metrics that are coming out, just the existing guidance, and as we learn together and open up these new markets, I mean, the idea of 10 million visits that Teladoc did and access to 70 million people, we know that something like 1/2 of those folks have a chronic condition. And they're looking for better solutions, and they want them delivered seamlessly.</p><p>So I think the upside here of you -- to quote you, Paul, the first global reach, scale, consumer-centric virtual care company, we haven't seen something like that. And that was the transformational vision that both management teams said, \"If we do this, we're going to create something that will be here and will fundamentally redefine the market.\" And anytime that happens, initially, there's people getting on board. And then they say, \"Oh, okay, you're not just a bookseller. You're a lot more,\" to use just a little analogy. I think that, that's what they're going to see here.</p><p>PAUL S. KWAN: Awesome, Glen. We're just on time perfectly. I want to thank you all for taking time to be with us, and we look forward to the future. And congratulations again.</p><p>MALA MURTHY: Thank you.</p><p>JASON NATHANIAL GOREVIC: Thanks, Paul.</p><p>JENNIFER SCHNEIDER: Thank you, Paul.</p><p>GLEN E.

Elizabeth Warren says she's running for president. But her attitude toward business suggests she's after a different title: CEO of the United States. The Massachusetts Democrat's short-sightedness, as well as her myopic view of the public's outlook on big tech companies, inspired her to announce plans to break up those tech companies, if she wins the presidential election. In a blog post on Medium, Warren described how it would work:\"Companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as \u2018platform utilities.\u2019 These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform.\"Simply put, it would allow the federal government to dictate how Google, Amazon, Apple, and other companies do business. Warren said Apple should not be allowed to sell apps in their app store. Amazon's line of in-house items called AmazonBasics wouldn't sell in the Amazon Marketplace. Facebook would have to break off Instagram and WhatsApp into separate entities. Additionally, since there's no statute of limitations on corporate mergers, Warren said she'd put the kibosh on Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods. The question is, why?Warren says, \"Today\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\"Balderdash. Whatever concerns people have with privacy as it relates to tech companies, to suggest they have \"power\" over our society and democracy is ludicrous. People use Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook because they want to and because they like to do so. Consumers like AmazonBasics. People like having their Apple devices synced together. For most who use Facebook, they enjoy the ease with which it allows them to stay connected to friends and family. Ordering from Whole Foods online and getting it delivered is a service Americans want. In short, Warren is advocating a solution to a problem that does not exist. Like so many other politicians, she suffers from the affliction of believing she knows better than the societal plebs posting photos on Instagram and ordering socks on Amazon. The market has influenced privacy concerns. Sometimes the government gives the companies a push by suggesting possible regulation, but there's nothing to suggest Warren's plan is necessary. It's just another in a long line of \"government knows best\" proposals that would do more harm than good.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2201222820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSV-X481-JBHT-D3KT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"422\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

In a country that lacks reliable ways to tell who might be a good borrower, these lenders use artificial intelligence and oddly personal data \u201d like tracking how fast prospective borrowers type on their phones \u201d to determine who will pay them back.  </p><p><br/>With Bai, they have failed. First he borrowed to start a business. When that went bust, he borrowed to bet on coal, rapeseed oil and sugar on China's futures markets.  <br/>Soon Bai began borrowing from one lender to pay another. Today, Bai is more than $5,000 in debt, on a paycheck of less than $600 a month.\"It's like gambling,\" said Bai, a university dropout who has cycled through a series of menial jobs like security guard and waiter.  <br/>\"You start to gamble. Soon you get addicted to it.\" With more than $100 billion worth of loans and rising worries among Chinese consumers about privacy, Beijing is moving to rein in a freewheeling, well-funded boom in online personal loans.  <br/>In November, the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, stopped companies and people from starting new online cash lending platforms. In early December, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said it would crack down on unlicensed cash loan companies and put a lid on high-interest loans. China's small loans are piling up.  <br/>More than 8,600 companies offer some form of small loan, and about $145 billion of those debts remain unpaid, according to the People's Bank of China. Other estimates run as high as $392 billion, according to the Boston Consulting Group.  <br/>The government does not track default rates among online lenders, which disclose little on their own.\"We are worried that in an environment where there is no effective credit system, people tend to overborrow, especially when capital comes in,\" said Bai Chengyu, an executive at the China Association of Microfinance, who is no relation to Bai Shichao.  <br/>These lenders originally emerged as a solution to that problem: how to lend to people with no credit history. By most estimates, that could total about 1 billion people. China turned to the fast-moving technology sector. Today, thousands of Chinese apps offer cash or financing, often within seconds, based on a wide array of sometimes deeply personal information.<br/><br/>China's biggest internet companies and financial names are funding the effort. Two years ago the central bank asked China's most successful internet companies \u201d including affiliates of sophisticated online giants Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group \u201d to create their own credit ratings systems.  <br/>Since then, it has declined to issue licenses that would formalize those systems, and officials have indicated in local news reports that the plan has fallen short of expectations.  <br/>Last month, an internet financial association affiliated with the People's Bank of China announced plans to start a system that would crunch data from China's big tech firms.  <br/>Few details were provided. The new online lending platforms also raise issues of privacy, a new but growing area of public concern in China.  <br/>Many platforms that track smartphone use have access to data like location services, phone contact lists and call logs that can be used to track and harass delinquent borrowers.\"The government has struggled a lot because they realize that consumers' personal information is everywhere,\" said Liu Yue, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group in Beijing.\"But they don't really know how to change that because the data is already being used.\"  <br/>Bai Chengyu of the China Association of Microfinance added that\"some cash loan companies use all kinds of soft violence to press customers to pay their loans back.\" Last month, Guangdong province in southern China warned that more than a dozen apps had security loopholes that allowed companies to steal user information. Some of this information was then used to harass borrowers and their friends and families.  <br/>One of those was an app called Paipaidai. Its parent company, PPDAI Group, recently listed its shares in New York. The Guangdong authorities said the app sends out users' contacts without permission. The practice\"seriously exposed users' privacy,\" the authorities said. One Paipaidai borrower, a man named Lin in a small town in Fujian province called Quanzhou, said he had racked up about $75,000 in loans from 30 different platforms for living expenses and an investment in a shoe store. Lin, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of reprisal from debt collectors, said he received multiple calls a day from them.  <br/>Lin showed images of text messages from one called Yongsheng Outsourcing that threatened to\"use whatever method to deal\" with debt that he owed to Paipaidai.  <br/>When contacted by The New York Times, a person at that number declined to say whether he worked for Yongsheng or Paipaidai. Paipaidai did not respond to requests for comment.  <br/>Bai Shichao, the food deliveryman with the growing debt problem, tapped some of China's most closely watched and best-funded online lending services during his borrowing spree. One of those was a company named Smart Finance.  <br/>Its app \u201d Yongqianbao, or\"use wallet\" in Chinese \u201d helps it build a credit rating system based on 1,200 data points related to user behavior. Yongqianbao then connects potential borrowers with lenders. Backed by the venture capital vehicle of Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and a prominent startup investor in China, it has approved 1.5 million loans a month.  <br/>Its algorithms look for correlations between behavior and repayment history \u201d and some of those are unusual. Yongqianbao considers how quickly people type on their phones, how often they eat takeout or how much power is left on their smartphone batteries when they apply for the loan.  <br/>It also evaluates whether the borrower took the time to read the Yongqianbao user agreement. Approval can come in eight seconds or less.  <br/>\"It is hard to determine how the machine knows,\" said Jiao Ke, a former Baidu product manager who created Smart Finance,\"but it is much more accurate\" than a traditional loan officer. Even borrowers like Bai who don't pay back \u201d what Jiao calls a\"controlled delinquency\" \u201d help the company by providing data, the company says. Smart Finance uses repayment behavior data to help strengthen its credit rating system,\"but there is still a long way to go,\" said Carrie Fang, a spokeswoman for Smart Finance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QATART-106483799</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QATART2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8H-GKB1-JDJN-601M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">357157</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1102\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Qatar Tribune.

The chief-executive-in-chief has filled his cabinet with fellow plutocrats, executives and, horrors, lobbyists. One who used to represent the coal industry runs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The acting interior secretary, David Bernhardt, risks so many potential conflicts of interest from his previous life lobbying for energy and natural-resources firms that he carries around a card listing all 22 of them. Last year businesses spent more than $3.4bn advancing their interests in the halls of government, 8.5% more than before the self-styled \"CEO president\" took office (see chart 1). The health-care, finance and industrial sectors each splurged over $500m. </p><p>Yet these sums may reflect not how easy life is for corporate America in Mr Trump's Washington, but how difficult. The Chamber of Commerce, which has had the ear of every president, has successfully championed massive corporate-tax cuts but failed to dissuade the president from imposing tariffs and curbing immigration. Big Pharma, which had managed to raise drug prices regardless of which party controlled the White House, is being pressed by Mr Trump to lower them. Big Tech has three firms among the ten biggest spenders on lobbying\u2014Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon\u2014but few friends in Washington, not least because Silicon Valley has been critical of the president, often vocally so. </p><p>An interrogation of data and, mostly on the condition of anonymity, of lobbyists from across the political spectrum confirms that advancing corporate interests in Mr Trump's Washington is no easier than under previous presidents. In some ways, it has got harder. And its results, gauged by firms' stockmarket performance, are ambiguous. Tax cuts have helped fuel a bull market in equities. But health care, which spends more than any other industry, has lagged behind (see chart 2 on next page).</p><p>One reason is that there is more to lobbying than buttering up the administration. As one veteran lobbyist notes, \"80% of what business cares about is in the ambit of Congress.\" Lawmakers, meanwhile, have grown charier of business folk. And not just left-leaning Democratic representatives swept onto Capitol Hill in November's mid-term elections; high drug prices have so angered ordinary Americans that even previously reliable Republican allies in Congress can no longer protect pharmaceutical firms. Tech firms are out of favour on both sides of the aisle. Gone are the days when a well-connected fixer could have a discreet word with a committee chairman and make a client's problem go away. Social media mean no more \"quiet issues\", says Tony Fratto, a former senior official in George W. Bush's administration and now an adviser at Hamilton Place Strategies. </p><p>More counterintuitively, currying favour with Mr Trump's supposedly business-friendly administration is no picnic, either. Lobbyists cite four main reasons. </p><p>First, the president is an outsider. \"Trump owes nothing to us,\" explains one of Big Pharma's top lobbyists. Nor do many of his appointees. Mr Trump rejected experienced Republicans who had not supported his candidacy, confides a senior financial lobbyist whose paymaster is an ardent Trump supporter. As a result, his administration is full of unknown entities. </p><p>Many, it is true, are business-friendly, especially compared with Barack Obama's big-government-loving lieutenants. But, and this is lobbyists' second headache, this must be weighed against the Trump bureaucracy's inefficiency. People are promoted for fealty to Mr Trump, not competence, which puts off many Republican technocrats; two years into the president's term, a record number of jobs across the executive branch remain unfilled. \"You don't take every issue to the White House,\" notes Thomas Donahue, the long-serving head of the Chamber of Commerce. On most, lobbyists must try to win over other officials. The top lobbyist for a big technology firm struggles to find out who is working on given issues and how to reach them to build connections. Sometimes, he says, it is difficult to tell if anyone is working on them at all. James Connaughton, a senior environmental official in George W. Bush's administration, calls Mr Trump's unceremonious rollback of environmental rules \"not deregulation but non-regulation\". Anarchy is bad for business.</p><p>Third, respectable businesses promoting their legitimate interests worry about being sullied by association with Mr Trump's entourage, or his views. His campaign manager and personal lawyer have been sentenced to prison terms. The president himself is under investigation for alleged campaign-finance violations. A veteran lobbyist turned unregistered influencer is convinced that \"everything will be investigated at some point\". She makes sure all her contacts with government are above board. </p><p>Mr Trump's opinions, meanwhile, do not necessarily reflect the interests of corporations. His anti-environmentalism has helped some polluters, particularly in his beloved coal industry, but provoked unease among big firms. Carmakers and large utilities both oppose laxer rules, which could backfire. A conservative lobbyist takes pains to distinguish his blue-chip clients from small-time coal firms seeking cronyistic carve-outs from the EPA. Several corporate-advisory councils to Mr Trump's administration disbanded in the wake of his refusal to condemn white supremacists. Get close to the president, sums up Mr Fratto, and \"you take on all of the baggage of Trump\".</p><p>Finally, the intrigue of the Trump White House would baffle a Kremlinologist. A lobbyist for a leading private-equity firm warns that power there \"shifts around very quickly\". Boutique lobbying shops have mushroomed, as under every new president. These claim to offer access, observes a former Republican heavyweight turned lobbyist, \"but lack substance\". In any case, only a handful of Mr Trump's closest advisers carry any clout with their boss. Chief among them is Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, whom one lobbyist describes as \"the last guy to put the president to bed\". Even so, Mr Trump can catch out top aides with tweets born of gut feelings. \"How do you lobby Trump's gut?\" grumbles an environmental lobbyist with experience in the Clinton administration. </p><p>Lobbyists are not short of ideas. Some use hyper-targeted advertising to reach the president as he watches Fox News or retreats to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, according to a recent expos\u00e9 by the Washingtonian, a magazine. T-Mobile, a telecoms firm, recently admitted to spending $195,000 at Mr Trump's hotel near the White House, with executives reportedly sporting bright pink shirts emblazoned with the firm's logo. Others advise clients to find a way to create jobs and to let the president take credit. A lobbyist for the lobbying industry warns that firms can no longer be too critical of the president, lest he unleash a withering tweet. But, he says, you can appeal to Mr Trump via Snapchat or Twitter. To reach the president, \"you've got to make him the hero of your story,\" counsels a seasoned Democratic lobbyist. </p><p>Some bosses, for their part, are getting more personally involved with the president, risk to reputation notwithstanding. \"Trump wants to hear directly from business leaders,\" says a former adviser to the president, whose administration he calls \"the most CEO-friendly\" ever. A Democratic operative agrees, noting the difference between Mr Trump and Mr Obama's posture of \"we know what's best for the American people\". A Republican member of one of Mr Trump's disbanded CEO councils recalls how past administrations' meetings with bosses \"felt perfunctory\", whereas now \"they seem to pay attention and seek company input\". When in late March Mr Trump addressed the Business Roundtable of America's biggest firms, Jeff Bezos, boss of Amazon, joined for the first time, even though Mr Trump had mocked him on Twitter as Jeff Bozo.</p><p>The \"swamp\" of Washington has not been drained, as Mr Trump implausibly pledged to do in his campaign. In some ways, concedes Anthony Scaramucci, a Trump loyalist who briefly served in his White House, it \"has gotten extra swampier\"\u2014a state of affairs he blames on both Democrats and Republicans. Unregistered \"strategic advisers\" began replacing registered lobbyists, whose number has fallen from 14,000 to 11,500 in a decade, before Mr Trump came along. Sheila Krumholz, head of the Centre for Responsive Politics, an independent watchdog that monitors lobbying trends, worries about influence-peddlers \"trading on only whom they know and not what they know\". Disclosure requirements remain weak and poorly enforced. Hyper-partisanship in Congress makes the House Democrats' sweeping anti-corruption bill, which was passed in March and, among other things, would tighten rules on lobbying, unlikely to clear the Republican-controlled Senate.</p><p>Swampier does not necessarily mean better for corporate America. It does, though, benefit the lobbying ecosystem's endemic species, which thrive on chaos. Haley Barbour, a former governor of Mississippi, ex-chairman of the Republican National Committee and one of Washington's most influential lobbyists, praises Mr Trump's tax cuts and deregulation efforts. Even so, he warns, \"the next reform might not be good for your firm, so you need somebody advocating your position to the White House.\" A friendly swamp creature will be there to help.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-7U7T6L1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVV-4VS1-DY2R-22M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1593\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

It also notes that various political failures such as<br/>some big tech companies' close government ties are hampering<br/>market growth.</p><p>But Adam Thierer, director of telecommunications studies at the<br/>Cato Institute, disagreed, saying he does not believe a national<br/>strategy should be put in place because a formal e-commerce<br/>policy would too closely resemble a Soviet-type approach and<br/>that it would further politicize an already political issue.<br/>Panelists agreed that an appropriate government role was to<br/>encourage international trade, boost research and development<br/>and ensure that the government does not protect the incumbent<br/>business not welcoming market changes.<br/>Mark Cooper, research director with Consumer Federation of<br/>America, said he thought the government's role was to protect<br/>consumers and ensure everyone has open access to the Internet.<br/>He added that the government also should ensure that major<br/>industry behemoths like America Online do not squash competition<br/>or consumer choice with business moves.<br/>Atkinson's paper focused on several key areas the administration<br/>should act on to propel the country into the information age.<br/>\"The question isn't how fast the digital economy is happening,<br/>the question is why don't I see more of the digital economy in<br/>front of me,\" Atkinson said.<br/>Congress should increase IT research funding by at least $275<br/>million this year, the policy paper suggests. Citing figures<br/>from the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee,<br/>which said IT R&amp;D funding needs to increase by $274 million each<br/>year for five years to meet the committee's goals, PPI says<br/>President Bush's fiscal 2002 budget falls short of that goal,<br/>with only increases IT research by about $40 million.<br/>The paper also recommends the administration require that all<br/>federal government Web sites become P3P and ICRA compliant. P3P,<br/>or the Platform for Privacy Preferences and the Internet Content<br/>Rating Association standards let sits rate themselves on their<br/>privacy policies and content, and lets consumers set their<br/>preferences for those things on their browsers.<br/>Bush should also issue an executive order to government<br/>agencies, calling on them to examine how their procurement,<br/>regulatory and other actions can speed the digitization of<br/>sectors they influence, Atkinson suggests. PPI also is pushing<br/>for the creation of a federal chief information officer who<br/>would oversee digital government initiatives. Atkinson also<br/>suggest Congress and the administration create a digital brigade<br/>of AmeriCorp and a program that funds nonprofit efforts to give<br/>poor and rural areas Internet access.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TCHDLY2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:43B9-CT60-00S7-03RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">232618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>National Journal's Technology Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 National Journal Group, Inc.</copyright><edition>PM Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>June 11, 2001</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>AOL INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>AOL (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>CATO INSTITUTE \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0CATO INSTITUTE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>AOL INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CATO INSTITUTE \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0CATO INSTITUTE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

No - all big companies do. Are we surprised Taoiseach Enda Kenny responded favourably to such lobbying efforts? Again, no. The German chancellor protects her country's car industry. The UK prime minister bats for London's financial services sector. So the Taoiseach may well give tech firms a hearing, especially when they're adding jobs in a recovering economy.</p><p>Nevertheless, correspondence between Mr Kenny and a senior Facebook executive, most likely chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, is revealing. What's clear is that the two big policy issues for Facebook are tax and data protection.</p><p>On tax, Facebook wanted the Government to keep its position \"in mind\" when engaging in international discussions on proposed tax-avoidance rules. The company also hinted that the outcomes of the tax law revisions could impact its investment strategy here.</p><p>\"We hope to be helpful to you identifying the implications with different options for future investment and growth in Europe,\" a Facebook executive, likely Ms Sandberg, wrote to Mr Kenny in February 2014.</p><p>It's almost certain that other big multinationals based in Ireland regularly engage in such lobbying.</p><p>Nevertheless, we now know Facebook explicitly put it on the agenda in a follow-up (June 2014) meeting between Ms Sandberg and Mr Kenny.</p><p>The second issue, data protection law, is more revealing. The correspondence shows Facebook congratulating the Taoiseach for \"internalising\" Facebook policy on formation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) during Ireland's presidency of the EU. That particular law is probably the single most important piece of data privacy law ever introduced in Europe.</p><p>\"You made enormous progress,\" the correspondence with the Taoiseach says. \"When it came to the European Data Protection Regulation, you and your staff really internalised our concerns and were able to present them in a reasonable way, which has had a positive impact on both the process and work product.\"</p><p>It's not clear how the Government advanced Facebook's specific requests.</p><p>However, it's apparent Facebook really wanted the principle of a single data regulator rather than a patchwork of them around the EU. It may not be a surprise that Facebook regarded the succession of Ireland's data protection commissioner as being one of interest to them.</p><p>The then commissioner, Billy Hawkes, had presided over an audit of the firm. By and large, his team gave Facebook a clean bill of health. This created some controversy at the time. Subsequently, a legal case on privacy against Facebook by Austrian student Max Schrems brought down a major transatlantic trade agreement (Safe Harbour).</p><p>Ultimately, the Irish Government may argue a close working relationship with big employers pays dividends. In the case of Facebook, it will point to 800 new jobs set for Dublin's north quays. Whether Ireland is any more pliable with big tech firms than Germany is with car companies or the UK is with banks remains to be seen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-125989314</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NN9-NT91-DY9P-N2GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>May 29, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

In the US, whatever genre of music they play, the stations crowded on to the FM waveband mix crass adverts with waves of songs uncluttered by any talking, suggesting that the only really important things are calmly getting through another very long drive while thinking about what to buy next. In Italy, what you hear is often hyperactive to the point of absurdity, as if there is simply too much to say and too much music to play, and the clock must endlessly be raced against.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Britain? Beyond the BBC's Radios 1, 2, 3, 6 Music and its city and county stations, there are set-ups traditionally grouped under the heading of \"independent local radio\": stations whose output suggests that a lot of us crave something that can distract us from whatever crisis the country has fallen into, while demanding little in return apart from keeping the dial where it is.</p><p>For all that their rather anodyne output could easily be maligned as the work of real-life <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">Alan Partridges</url>, any journey around the country could once upon a time be marked out by what crackled in and out of range as you drove: Red Dragon, Leicester Sound, Marcher Sound, Trent FM, Lakeland Radio. But over time, many of these stations have been subsumed under the nationwide brands of Capital, Heart and Smooth, all of which are now owned by a giant conglomerate called Global. Two weeks ago, following a watershed loosening of the rules by the broadcasting regulator       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">Ofcom</url>, there came confirmation of where all this has been heading.</p><p>Despite the fact that UK commercial radio is booming (in 2018, it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">attracted more than \u00a3700m in advertising revenue</url> ), Global announced that it was axing around       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">60 local breakfast and drive-time programmes</url>, remodelling local news bulletins in line with \"refreshed structures\", and closing studios in places such as Brighton, Chelmsford, Exeter, Gloucester, Kendal, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon. Among the consequences are the prospect of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">Scotland losing dedicated breakfast shows</url> to distant voices from London, and a single news team now covering an area that stretches from Cornwall to Gloucester.</p><p>Since 2005 the UK has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">seen a net loss of 245 local newspapers</url>. In the absence of broadcast or print media to document many places' affairs and thereby make sense of them, people have inevitably taken refuge in the same social media platforms that have so       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">driven the demise of local news</url>. This has obvious drawbacks, many of which are bound up with our ever-more polarised public discourse. (If you've ever watched England's often poisonous debate about immigration take the form of local Facebook tear-ups that often have little basis in fact, you'll know what a news vacuum looks like, and why Mark Zuckerberg's creation is often the last thing that ought to be filling the gap.)</p><p>As outlets have closed, the idea of the media as a distant, arrogant thing, seemingly little interested in anything beyond the M25, has been confirmed. Given, moreover, that austerity has blitzed such shared local institutions as libraries, arts venues and youth centres, and that councils themselves are clinging on by their fingernails, you start to wonder how the places they once served are meant to maintain any coherent notion of themselves, let alone have a meaningful collective voice. In such disrupted times as ours, the world surely starts to look even more senseless and arbitrary than it actually is. As the police disappear from your streets, and your services are cut, there are fewer and fewer people who can shine a light on what is happening. If you have a local story that goes to the heart of corporate or governmental failure, where do you go with it?</p><p>I sometimes wonder whether this might be the age of the Unplace, deprived of the basic means via which it can collectively talk about either the present or future. Unplaces are there, but somehow not there; praised, particularly in the wake of the 2016 referendum, as the very embodiment of stolid decency, but either ignored or condescended. The latest instalment of this story is the government's so-called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">Stronger Towns Fund</url>, so paltry that it looks less like meaningful investment than some kind of desperate crisis payment: no solution to 10 years of cuts, let alone the turbulent realities of Brexit.</p><p>So what to do? As far as the existing media are concerned, some of the specifics are obvious. Ofcom should never have waved through the gobbling-up of so many radio stations, or so senselessly rolled back regulations that kept their local element just about intact. It is a good thing that Facebook is donating \u00a34.5m to fund <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">80 UK local newspaper jobs</url> for the next two years; good, too, that Google has also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">made contributions</url> to grassroots journalism.</p><p>But these are ad hoc initiatives, which only underline the need for a new set of arrangements. Put another way, the most pressing conversation to be had about the media is probably not about the nastiness of the Daily Mail or whether John Humphrys should have long since retired, but how to build - pretty much from scratch, and with a sizeable tax contribution from big tech - a new means of locally holding power to account, and sustaining a sense of community.</p><p>There are some pointers to the future. It is heartening to hear that the BBC is set on \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">reinventing</url> \" its 39 place-specific radio stations in England and re-emphasising their \"localness\" - and that the corporation now funds 150 new local democracy reporters, who doggedly track just about every aspect of local government, and contribute to what remains of local newspapers, often in their online versions. There are around       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">250 community radio stations</url> in the UK, which claim 3.5 million listeners, and an apparently growing network of so-called \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/alan-partridge-bbc-brexit-steve-coogan\">hyperlocal</url> \" news and information websites - though it's all too telling that they are too often devoid of hard news content, and largely run by volunteers.</p><p>With the right financial help, there surely ought to be some means of developing all these things, so long as two key principles are understood: first, that although radio, TV and orthodox print journalism are important, the future will also be about online video and podcasting; and second, that it is high time we got over our rigid division of the media into \"national\" and \"local\", and blurred the two. If that happened, the current sense of large swaths of the London media little realising what is going on in the country might recede, political ruptures might not take quite so many people by surprise, and we might be that little bit more at ease with ourselves.</p><p>The alternative, needless to say, is an ever-expanding silence, broken only by a dull sound: the same Ed Sheeran song the country over, played by the same presenter who addresses everywhere from Kendal to Clacton, whose superficial bonhomie suddenly sounds like it is masking a sneaking contempt. To cap it all, the local radio station on which they do their stuff may now be called Capital: the kind of absurd symbolism that is 21st-century Britain all over.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52507090</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-TKY1-F021-62X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1182\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Josh Hawley introduced legislation Tuesday that would give internet users the ability to opt out of allowing their personal data to be tracked and collected, the latest effort in the Missouri Republican's broader campaign against big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley's Do Not Track Act is modeled after the national Do Not Call list, which allows people to opt out of telemarketing calls.</p><p>Hawley's office says it would allow internet users to opt out of tracking by clicking a setting in their browsers or by downloading an app. Hawley said the measure is in response to big tech companies collecting \"incredible amounts of deeply personal, private data from people without giving them the option to meaningfully consent.\"</p><p>\"They have gotten incredibly rich by employing creepy surveillance tactics on their users, but too often the extent of this data extraction is only known after a tech company irresponsibly handles the data and leaks it all over the internet,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"The American people didn't sign up for this, so I'm introducing this legislation to finally give them control over their personal information online.\"</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would have the authority to enforce the legislation, and the bill would give the FTC the power to create related regulations.</p><p>Companies would face a minimum $100,000 fine or up to $1,000 per day per affected person for knowingly violating the rules. Negligent violations could be punished by as much as $50 per day per affected person.</p><p>The bill includes an exception for data collected to help law enforcement.</p><p>ST. LOUIS COUNTY - I-44 shutdown scheduled: All lanes of Interstate 44 between Interstate 270 and South Geyer Road will be closed in Sunset Hills later this month to remove an overpass, the Missouri Department of Transportation announced.</p><p>The interstate will close at 7 p.m. on Friday, May 31, so workers can remove the westbound Watson Road overpass bridge over I-44. The interstate is set to reopen by 5 a.m. on Monday, June 3.</p><p>Crews will work rebuilding the bridge for five months, according to the department.</p><p>During the closure, drivers will still be able to access both north and south I-270 and eastbound Watson Road from both directions of I-44. But drivers who wish to continue on I-44 will be detoured.</p><p>Eastbound drivers will be redirected to take Watson Road and turn onto Lindbergh Boulevard to get back to Interstate 44.</p><p>Westbound Interstate 44 drivers will be redirected to take the Interstate 270 exit and use the westbound Watson ramp after the bridge to continue on west on Interstate 44.</p><p>When the lanes reopen, eastbound I-44 will be restriped with two regular lanes, one ramp lane for northbound I-270 and one ramp lane for southbound I-270.</p><p>The new lanes will give crews working on the Watson Road overpass room to reconstruct the bridge as well as drainage and pavement work.</p><p>While the bridge is closed, Watson Road drivers can use Lindbergh to access westbound I-44 and northbound and southbound I-270.</p><p>ST. LOUIS - Lottery customer wins $1 million: If you recently bought a lottery ticket in Defiance, Monday could have been your lucky day.</p><p>The Missouri Lottery announced that someone purchased a winning Mega Millions ticket worth $1 million at the Double D Market, 1300 Highway DD.</p><p>The ticket matched all five white-ball numbers drawn Friday: 5, 17 28, 32 and 63.</p><p>The lottery advised the winner to sign the back of the ticket immediately. Winners have 180 days after the drawing to claim their prize at a lottery office in St. Louis, Jefferson City, Kansas City or Springfield.</p><p>LADUE - John Burroughs plan advances: The City Council approved an amendment Monday to a special use permit that would allow John Burroughs School, at 755 South Price Road, to construct a new natatorium.</p><p>The amendment changes the campus site plan, including construction of an additional parking area with 64 new spaces, renovation of a 35-year-old, six-lane natatorium to become a multi-purpose athletic space (including squash courts), construction of a new eight-lane natatorium just south of the existing facility, and modifications to an existing field hockey field, to enlarge the field slightly and install new synthetic turf to allow its use for multiple sports (including lacrosse and soccer) and install new permanent bleachers. The proposal does not request lighting or a sound system for the field.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Kevin Speis of VFW Post 5077 of O'Fallon, Mo., waves to motorcyclists from Big Bend Road over Interstate 270 in Kirkwood during Tuesday's \"Run for the Wall\" event.

Without the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, no one would have ever known that Atlanta educators altered students' standardized test results in 44 public schools to make the district look more successful.</p><p>But despite top-notch investigative work from the AJC and other news outlets, the news industry as a whole continues to hemorrhage money and talent.</p><p>News media blamed Big Tech for journalism's decline, especially in rural and local markets, at a House hearing on Tuesday, fueling the antitrust fire to break up companies like Facebook and Google.</p><p>\"Our audience has never been larger than it is now,\" Riley told members of the House Judiciary Committee. \"We have more people reading the Atlanta Journal-Constitution than at any point in our history. In what kind of world do you grow your audience and somehow face even greater financial challenges than before? Something is out of whack in that equation and counterintuitive to how business works. When you invest, and you succeed, you reap the benefits. That's not happening for newspapers.\"</p><p>And it's Big Tech's fault.</p><p>Representatives David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) described a causal relationship between Google's acquisitions data and advertising companies and the decline of newspapers across the U.S.</p><p>Since 2007, Google has acquired most of its competitors, concentrating the ad market. Since 2007, almost 2,000 news publishers ceased operation. Nadler said many cities and counties don't have local news at all.</p><p>\"This journalism crisis is also a democracy crisis,\" Nadler said. \"American civic life suffers. A lot of [publications] don't even assign a reporter to cover state and local government.\" Nadler linked the lack of local government coverage to lower voter turnout.</p><p>It's not just local news -- the national outlets are struggling, too.</p><p>In a call with reporters before the hearing, Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) and two recently laid off reporters, Laura Bassett formerly of HuffPost and John Stanton formerly of BuzzFeed, discussed how Big Tech's impact extends to seemingly successful news sites like BuzzFeed.</p><p>\"We've had something like 2,500 journalists lose their jobs this year,\" Stanton said. \"I think it's a problem journalists need to start addressing. It's tough for us because we don't like to be advocates, it's a separation of church and state kind of thing. But we have to start talking about this and taking an interest in this and standing up for ourselves against these Big Tech companies that are eating up all the ad revenue and impacting good and successful journalists.\"</p><p>News media and members of Congress fear market concentration in the tech market disables journalists from providing an essential service to democracy: speaking truth to power.</p><p>\"Diminished transparency may encourage governments to engage in riskier or more corrupt financial engagements,\" Nadler said. \"As the judge breaking up AT&amp;T wrote, the values of the First Amendment coincide with antitrust enforcement.\"</p><p>From an economics point of view, the Open Markets Institute's Director of Enforcement Strategy Sally Hubbard said Big Tech companies essentially engage in rent-seeking when dealing with news media.</p><p>\"Because they don't have any competition, they're free to pursue [destructive] practices without constraint,\" she told members of the committee. \"There is extraction that's happening and there's not fair bargaining power between the press and the tech platforms because that's not a fair price, it's a monopoly rent.\"</p><p>Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) warned against regulating a rapidly evolving industry and encouraged Congress not to rush to judgment in its antitrust fervor.</p><p>\"Big is not necessarily bad,\" he said. \"We need to make sure both sides are involved, and that's my concern in this. Everyone has the right to an opinion.\"</p><p>During the press call before the hearing, DeSaulnier, Bassett and Chase and Neil Chase, CEO of CalMatters and former executive editor of The Mercury News and East Bay Times, discussed how individual philanthropists and nonprofits might save the news media if regulators and lawmakers don't take action against Big Tech.</p><p>Already, nonprofits and philanthropists own and fund news outlets -- some startups, some legacies, some print, some online -- to sustain journalism. Paul Huntsman, for example, bought the failing Salt Lake Tribune in 2016 and wants to turn it into a nonprofit.</p><p>But journalists and members of Congress worry they may not have enough time for wealthy benefactors to save struggling news outlets. Cicilline introduced the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act in March, which would provide a \"safe harbor\" for news outlets to collectively negotiate with Facebook and Google on how the tech giants handle quality, accuracy and attribution of news articles.</p><p>More than 200,000 news outlets and 44 state press associations support the bill.</p><p>\"We produce journalism that is distinguished by its depth, accuracy and originality,\" Riley said. \"That costs money and is expensive, but if the system works correctly, it also makes money that the paper uses to investigate and develop the next story or cover the next local event. If others repackage our journalism and make money off it, yet none of that money makes its way back to the local paper, then it makes breaking that next story or exposing the next scandal more challenging. If that cycle continues indefinitely, quality local journalism will slowly wither and eventually cease to exist.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Tech usage, on almost every measure, has gone through the roof. \u201cDigital transformation\u201d has been the buzzword in business circles for years, as companies tried to rethink everything about how they operate. It turns out that for disciples of digitisation, there\u2019s nothing like a global pandemic to force change.</p><p>That the digital future is suddenly rushing closer has been underlined by tech industry leaders during their latest earnings announcements this week. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b645d2f8-89f9-11ea-a109-483c62d17528\"> Satya Nadella</url>, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive officer, probably summed it up best: Social distancing rules, he said, have brought \u201ca remote everything\u201d.</p><p>Sundar Pichai, his counterpart at Google, pointed to an across-the-board leap in digital activity, and predicted a \u201csignificant and lasting\u201d impact from the forced move to online work, education, shopping, medicine and entertainment.</p><p>According to Mr Nadella, the crisis has brought forward the adoption of a wide range of technologies by two years. The precise pace can be debated. But the direction is clear from the heightened levels of digital activity taking place \u2014 even if it isn't necessarily showing through yet in the earnings of the tech companies, which are not immune from the economic pain.\u00a0</p><p>The pandemic is working on all the main levers that affect the pace of digital adoption: consumer behaviour, business processes and government regulation.</p><p>On the consumer side, changes in behaviour that usually take years are happening overnight. It is a truism of all new consumer tech that the hardest part is not convincing people that a new product or service would satisfy a need: it\u2019s getting them to change their ingrained habits long enough to let the new technology into their lives.</p><p>There is likely to be plenty of time for some of the behaviours learnt during the coronavirus crisis to become second-nature, as social distancing rules stay in place for a protracted period. Old ways of living and working will gradually return. But the forced behavioural change across an entire population is something that Big Tech\u2019s marketing departments couldn\u2019t have dreamt of.</p><p>On the corporate side, meanwhile, adapting entrenched business processes to accommodate new technologies is every bit as difficult as changing consumer behaviour. That is one reason that tech revolutions aren\u2019t immediately evident in broader productivity figures: actually putting a revolutionary technology to use across the economy takes years of painful adjustment.</p><p>Companies are being forced to move more quickly just to keep their businesses running. They also need to cut costs and redesign how work is done to ensure their survival in what could be a long slump. Automation technologies, to pick one field that should benefit, are particularly well suited to a world in which human beings can\u2019t get close to each other.</p><p>The next phase of the pandemic will bring an object lesson in how to integrate the digital and real worlds of work over an extended period of time. Companies will have to learn how to meld their sparsely populated offices with a distributed workforce scattered to the four winds. The processes developed to deal with this period will become the new rails on which business runs. No one will be inclined to rip them up when the crisis passes.</p><p>On the government side, meanwhile, regulatory requirements and mandates have had to adapt. One of the most dramatic changes, as Mr Nadella noted, has been the relaxation of regulations around telemedicine. The technology to enable remote medicine has been available for years, but it has taken forced distancing to bring it into use. Many patients who have experienced it won\u2019t want to go back.</p><p>Distance learning is another case in point. The effects can be seen across the activities of a digital conglomerate such as Google. The number of students and teachers using Google Classroom has doubled in two months, to 100m; the company reports a \u201cmassive increase\u201d in sales of Google-designed Chromebooks, the laptop of choice for many schools; and time spent on the internet company\u2019s Meet video app, used by students as well as workers, is up 30-fold.</p><p>Many loose and incorrect analogies have been drawn between the pandemic and a war, but the comparison holds in at least one sense: Both can precipitate broad societal change. A return to anything approaching pre-Covid normality will bring a drop-off in digital activity. Human beings will rediscover the joys of personal contact. But the world left behind will be very different from the one that preceded the crisis.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-f1bf5ba5102942529150b4440478a2e7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT2-KDY1-JB77-K0SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 1, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Ron Wyden of Oregon has a new idea to make sure companies protect users' personal information: Threaten prison for executives who mishandle that data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wyden said Thursday that his Consumer Data Protection Act is a \"sweeping\" bill to give consumers more control over their data, force companies to be transparent about how they use people's data and impose steep fines and even prison on executives who violate the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big tech is the target: Companies with more than $50 million in yearly revenue -- and who store more than 1 million users' data -- would be subject to the law, according to the draft text. Companies with more than $1 billion in yearly revenue that have data on 1 million people (as well as companies that handle data of more than 50 million people) would need to submit routine reports to the Federal Trade Commission on privacy breaches.</p><p>Purposefully misleading regulators on those data protection reports would result in a fine of as much as $5 million, or up to 20 years in prison for senior executives, according to the draft bill text.</p><p>\"Today's economy is a giant vacuum for your personal information,\" Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a statement. \"Everything you read, everywhere you go, everything you buy and everyone you talk to is sucked up in a corporation's database.\"</p><p> 'I know about the secret:' Bitcoin blackmail scam targets men through mail, cops say </p><p>Wyden's bill comes as tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google face increased scrutiny over what they're doing to safeguard users' data and privacy. </p><p>Last month, 50 million Facebook users' personal information was exposed, the company said. And just a year ago Equifax, the credit reporting company, fell victim to a gigantic hack that put more than 100 million Americans' data at risk.</p><p>The FTC would enforce Wyden's proposed bill if it became law, and 175 more people would be hired to police companies' use of people's personal data. Wyden characterized the proposal as a set of \"tough rules with real teeth to punish companies that abuse Americans' most private information.\"</p><p>The bill would also establish a \"Do Not Track\" database so people could choose not to let websites store -- and then sell -- their personal information.</p><p>Another proposal in the bill would allow people to see what personal data companies have on them, and see who that data has been sold to, according to a summary of the bill posted by Wyden's office.</p><p>One tech leader praised the bill in a statement released by Wyden's office.</p><p>\"By forcing companies that sell and monetize user data to be more transparent about their data practices, the bill will also empower consumers to make better-informed privacy decisions online, enabling companies like ours to compete on a more level playing field,\" said Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of search engine DuckDuckGo, according to the news release.</p><p>But the bill is an \"extreme departure\" from regulations most tech industry groups and privacy advocates have proposed, Bloomberg reports -- and its fate would depend heavily on which party controls Congress after next week's elections.</p><p>Facebook privacy: Three lessons on data, apps and taking precautionsLately, users are asking themselves about what data they share publicly on Facebook and who can access it. Here are some steps users can take to protect their data in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica breach. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSTRB-4385a69fbf9542338dc82f53fd7c5d24</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSTRB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TMK-F7P1-DYJM-M2RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">262920</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"565\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 1, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

C'est l'une des rares certitudes du moment : alors que tant d'entreprises sont \u00e0 la peine, que des pans entiers de l'\u00e9conomie mondiale sont \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat, les grands noms de la Tech, et plus particuli\u00e8rement les g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains, sortiront renforc\u00e9s de la crise. Plus puissants, plus riches, plus conqu\u00e9rants. Depuis six mois, les fameux Gafa, qui regroupent Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, encha\u00eenent les records \u00e0 Wall Street, comme s'ils \u00e9voluaient dans un monde parall\u00e8le. Un exemple parmi d'autres ? Depuis le printemps, le fabricant de l'iPhone a vu sa capitalisation boursi\u00e8re s'envoler de plus de 1 000 milliards de dollars. A elle seule, la firme \u00e0 la pomme croqu\u00e9e vaut plus que l'ensemble des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises composant le CAC 40, l'indice phare de la Bourse de Paris.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">n\u00b0 3610 semaine du 10 au 16 septembre 2020</emphasis></p><p>Parce que la p\u00e9riode du confinement et l'essor du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail ont d\u00e9multipli\u00e9 les usages num\u00e9riques, parce que les infrastructures Internet ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 leur robustesse et parce que, enfin, le tra\u00e7age de l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie a rendu leurs outils indispensables, les stars de la Silicon Valley se sont immisc\u00e9es un peu plus profond\u00e9ment dans nos vies. Formidable acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur de la transformation num\u00e9rique, le Covid-19 a tout bonnement rendu les Gafa intouchables, ou presque. Un nouveau statut qui trouve sa traduction dans leur impressionnant parcours boursier, mais qui transpara\u00eet aussi \u00e0 travers les montagnes de cash accumul\u00e9es par les uns et les autres. </p><p>De quoi nourrir le d\u00e9bat sur les pro-fits ind\u00e9cents engrang\u00e9s par ces acteurs et relancer les initiatives visant \u00e0 mieux les r\u00e9guler. Abus de position dominante, pratiques anticoncurrentielles, optimisation fiscale... Les angles d'attaque ne manquent pas, et l'audition tr\u00e8s m\u00e9diatis\u00e9e, cet \u00e9t\u00e9, des quatre grands patrons de la Tech am\u00e9ricaine devant une commission du Congr\u00e8s pourrait laisser penser que cette parenth\u00e8se enchant\u00e9e est sur le point de se terminer pour ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. </p><p>Rien n'est moins s\u00fbr en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, car le contexte n'est plus le m\u00eame qu'avant la pand\u00e9mie. Mobilis\u00e9s sur les fronts sanitaire et \u00e9conomique, les Etats les plus offensifs sur ces questions ont d'autres priorit\u00e9s \u00e0 traiter que le dossier des Gafa. Surtout, politiquement, la donne a chang\u00e9 aux Etats-Unis : si Donald Trump continue de s'en prendre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement aux \u00ab Big Tech \u00bb, il le fait principalement \u00e0 des fins \u00e9lectoralistes, parce qu'il per\u00e7oit ces groupes comme des alli\u00e9s objectifs du camp d\u00e9mocrate. Mais, en pleine crise \u00e9conomique et sur fond de tensions croissantes avec le rival chinois, jamais le pr\u00e9sident am\u00e9ricain ne prendra le risque d'affaiblir ces nouveaux fleurons nationaux. Comme les compagnies p\u00e9troli\u00e8res ou le complexe militaro-industriel hier, les Gafa sont devenus des pi\u00e8ces ma\u00eetresses au service de la puissance am\u00e9ricaine, ce qui explique l'opposition de Washington \u00e0 tout projet multilat\u00e9ral de taxation des g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique, et la frilosit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures engag\u00e9es outre-Atlantique : en dehors d'enqu\u00eates cibl\u00e9es sur le champ concurrentiel, les menaces de d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement semblent aujourd'hui bel et bien \u00e9cart\u00e9es pour les titans californiens. Le nouveau visage r\u00e9galien de Macron Chevaux mutil\u00e9s : les \u00e9leveurs \u00e0 cran Guerre des prix dans la distribution Boris Johnson, la fin de l'\u00e9tat de gr\u00e2ce </p><p>Dans ce contexte, l'Europe n'a pas dit son dernier mot et continuera de faire ce qu'elle peut sur le terrain fiscal ou sur celui de la concurrence. Mais on sent bien que ses moyens d'action ont touch\u00e9 leurs limites. Pour r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrer le rapport de force avec les superpuissances de la Tech, de nouveaux leviers doivent \u00eatre actionn\u00e9s, de nouvelles pistes doivent \u00eatre explor\u00e9es. La pand\u00e9mie a rouvert le jeu de ce point de vue, en changeant le statut des Gafa, devenus le temps du confinement des <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">utilities</emphasis> (fournisseurs de services essentiels). Au m\u00eame titre que les op\u00e9rateurs t\u00e9l\u00e9coms, les compagnies de gaz ou d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, les g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7us pendant cette p\u00e9riode in\u00e9dite comme des <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">utilities</emphasis> num\u00e9riques, soudain investies d'une nouvelle mission, au service du \u00ab bien commun \u00bb. Un virage plus important qu'il n'en a l'air, car il ouvre des perspectives int\u00e9ressantes : par nature, le champ d'action des <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">utilities</emphasis> est en effet balis\u00e9 par une forme de r\u00e9gulation, sur le plan tarifaire notamment. Il l\u00e9gitime un certain droit de regard de la puissance publique, et favorise sur le papier un dialogue plus constructif avec les autorit\u00e9s. Ne nous enflammons pas... A ce stade, cette petite r\u00e9volution rel\u00e8ve bien s\u00fbr de la pens\u00e9e magique. Mais il y a l\u00e0 un sillon \u00e0 creuser, susceptible de \u00ab responsabiliser \u00bb les Big Tech. Et de redorer leur image.

But as Google, Facebook and other web firms have grown too big for the government to ignore, their executives have been spending more time in the nation's capital. They don't expect to be left alone\u2014who does? But they wouldn't mind being regulated with a light touch. Among their ports of call are the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), two big agencies whose chairmen are changing.</p><p> On March 4th Edith Ramirez, one of five FTC commissioners, became the agency's new supremo, replacing Jon Leibowitz, who had been chairman since 2009. And on March 22nd <person><nameText>Julius Genachowski, </nameText></person>the head of the FCC, announced that he, too, plans to step down in the next few weeks. As The Economist went to press, <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>had yet to announce a replacement for Mr Genachowski, who, like Ms Ramirez, got to know the president when they were all at Harvard Law School. These appointments come at a tricky time for some big tech firms, amid much fretting about their market power and their use of personal data.</p><p>During Mr Leibowitz's tenure, the FTC homed in on web firms' use of data, requiring companies such as Googleand Facebook to sign \"consent decrees\" under which they agreed to strengthen their privacy programmes and submit them to regular independent audits. Consumer groups were overjoyed and hope Ms Ramirez will take an even stricter stance on privacy, though her record as an FTC commissioner suggests she is more likely to favour self-regulation over government action.</p><p> Under Mr Genachowski's reign, which also began in 2009, the FCC has focused on improving America's broadband provision. Use has expanded and average download speeds have almost doubled during his tenure, though America is still slower than Turkey and Portugal, according to the OECD, never mind Japan and South Korea. Critics gripe that the FCC should have promoted more competition between broadband providers.</p><p> The FCC's record on encouraging the spread of superfast 4G wireless networks has been more impressive. Thanks in part to Mr Genachowski's efforts to free spectrum for wireless operators, America has gone from a laggard to a leader in the mobile arena and has pioneered the app economy. Keeping it on top will be a challenge for Mr Genachowski's successor, rumoured to be Tom Wheeler, a venture capitalist and a former head of wireless and cable-TV industry groups. </p><p> Another task will be to defend the FCC's \"network neutrality\" rules. Introduced in 2010, these enshrine the principle that no restrictions should be placed on content and services carried over the web. That means internet service providers cannot favour their own offerings (or those of third parties willing to pay them a premium) over those of competitors. Verizon and MetroPCS have filed a legal challenge to the rules and a court hearing is likely later this year. Both Ms Ramirez and her counterpart at the FCC will be busy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-603L2G5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:582M-FS71-DY2R-23WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"503\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Thanks, everybody, for attending. Sorry for the delay, we had some technical issues with the webcast. So hopefully, everybody is able to log on. But thankfully, when you guys were here, hopefully you guys got some food outside. And anyways, welcome to Logitech's Analyst and Investor Day. I'm going to go through a long litany of our forward-looking statements, so bear with me, as you can probably check your Bloomberg quotes while I'm doing this.</p><p>The press release as well as the live webcast of this presentation is available hopefully online now finally at the Investor Relations page of our website, logitech.com.</p><p>During the course of these presentations, we may make forward-looking statements along with respect to future operating results that are being made under the safe harbor of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these statements. Factors that can cause actual results to differ materially include those set forth in Logitech's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, and subsequent filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new developments or otherwise.</p><p>Please note that today's presentations will include results reported on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP reporting is provided to help you better understand our business. However, non-GAAP financial results are not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be used only in conjunction with Logitech's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Earnings press release includes a table detailing these non-GAAP measures together with the corresponding GAAP numbers and reconciliation to GAAP. This information is also posted on our Investor Relations website. We encourage listeners to review these items. Bear with me, we're almost done.</p><p>Unless noted otherwise, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency, and all reported results and outlook are focused on continuing operations and do not include the performance of Lifesize, which is reported under discontinued operations. These presentations are being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations page of the Logitech website.</p><p>Today's agenda will include presentations from Bracken and Nate, as well as several members of our leadership team. We will take a break in between and then have a Q&amp;A at around noon. We have product demos in the back including a racing wheel for anybody who wants to pretend they're a fast car driver. And I encourage everybody to take a look and try out some of the products.</p><p>And with that, let me turn this presentation over to Bracken Darrell, Logitech's President and CEO.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL S.A.: Great. Okay. First, thanks a lot, everyone, for coming, and for those of you who are listening in or watching. Before I get any further, I want to say 2 things. First, I want to introduce a couple of people who will not be presenting. You know Guerrino De Luca, most of you do, who is our former Chairman, former CEO, current Board Member and a close adviser and partner for me. And then I want to introduce Wendy Becker, who is 1 of 2 women who are chairs of a Swiss company, and she has been on our Board for how many years, Wendy, 3? 3 years. It seems like much longer to me. No, I'm kidding. She's been on the Board for 3 years. She's been an incredibly active and powerhouse participant, and she is now the Chair of our Board, which is really exciting, and has become a great partner for me, too.</p><p>I want to introduce a couple of other people who you probably don't know as well. Kirsty Russell is in the back of the room. You probably can't see her if you are on the webcast, but she has been our Head of People and Culture for how long? 4 years. So 4 years of amazing improvement in our culture. And I'm not saying that in jest, it's really true. And then Alex Grab, who is our General Counsel, who has been in place for how many weeks? Not long, but we're protected legally. He's here in the room. And I'm not going to introduce the rest of our management team because they're going to be presenting, and they'll introduce themselves as we go through.</p><p>It's been an amazing period for me, and I'll talk more about that in a minute, but it's been an amazing year for everybody. Amazing in good ways and in bad ways. And I'm going to do something that we have not done at one of these Analyst/Investor Days before, which I'm going to start with this current year. And I want to give you a quick update on what we released today.</p><p>The first -- through the first 3 quarters, we originally guided back in -- at this time a year ago at our Analyst/Investor Day in Zurich, we guided the mid- to high single-digit growth and a profitability level, our operating income, non-GAAP operating income of $375 million to $385 million. All of you are familiar with that. You're also familiar that the first set of tumultuous surprises during the year was the impact of tariffs. That had a 100 basis point impact on our cost. It also had a dampening effect on our U.S. sales as we raised prices to offset the added cost that we saw from tariffs. But we weathered that.</p><p>We, at the same time, had currency impacts, another 100 basis point impact on our operating income, which we weathered that. And by the end of the third quarter, so the last time we talked to investors and shareholders, at the end of our third quarter, back in January, we reported 7% top line growth rate year-to-date, 7% bottom line growth rate, and really a year that was well on track to that guidance despite $60 million of cost headwinds.</p><p>Now roll forward to today, why are we talking about this? First, we're reaffirming that top line guidance, which was admittedly quite a wide range, so easier to stay within. So mid- to high single digits, we've reaffirmed that. Now even within that, we're seeing, because of the coronavirus impact on supply, about a $30 million impact on our sales. Most of that is China, some of that is supply limitations in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>On the operating income side, we have not only the $60 million of cost headwinds, which we had really digested, but we have another $15 million potential impact to the bottom line. So we have revised our guidance to mid- to high single digits. We're confirming the revenue line, but we're lowering our guidance slightly or modestly to $365 million to $375 million, so a $10 million reduction in the range. The top end of our range continues to be the low end of the range we gave you before.</p><p>Now this is a strange comment especially coming from me, because it's been -- I've been in this job for 8 years and I've never lowered guidance. So to do it in the last quarter of the year, of any quarter of any year, it's going to sound like a strange comment. But I'm actually proud of this number because I feel like it reflects the fact that we are an incredible operating machine. We execute well. When we faced the tariffs, we -- I think we did an extremely good job of moving manufacturing where we should have, of lowering cost to offset the tariff impacts and of delivering in spite of that.</p><p>When we faced currency impacts this year, we managed to lower our costs, renegotiated with suppliers, especially in China, and we managed to offset all of that. This one has hit us so late in the year that's it's been very difficult for us to manage, but I'm super proud of our ability to manage it. I've got a chart up here now, for those of you who are listening on audio, that is extremely blurry by design and extremely detailed by design. And the reason why I'm showing that is because I want you to see how deeply we go into this.</p><p>We have 300 -- we've got 320 suppliers. We have about 320 key suppliers, first-tier, second-tier suppliers. How many of those are in Wuhan? Five of them are in Wuhan, the rest are elsewhere -- mostly elsewhere in China. We know exactly where they are, every week, every day in terms of their ability to meet their own commitments to us and how leveraged they are in their factory from an employment standpoint. And as you can see, if you look on the right side of this chart, you'll see things going from red to less red to little green. These are weeks -- these are week by week by week us watching this as we go through the quarter.</p><p>And our expectation is, and it looks really good right now is that this impact of supply, at least for now, the impact of supply we've seen from the coronavirus in China is moderating. And by the end of, say, April, it should be completely cleared. By the end of March, mostly cleared. So I feel good about where we are. It has hit us late enough in the year, we had the impact on our guidance on the profit line, but I think that's about as much as we -- as you could have imagined that we could have done.</p><p>Now with that, I'm going to wait for questions on that until the end, because any question you ask may dip into next year's guidance, so I'm going to touch that at the end of this presentation.</p><p>This is my -- I think this is my eighth -- I think this is seventh or eighth Analyst and Investor Day. And I have to say, I still feel like a beginner. Every -- I'm so excited about this business and so excited about what we can do. It was actually very difficult for me this year to pick out what to present because we've got a lot more than we could have shown here. So we've been sort of choiceful, as you'll see, but I'm excited about all of it.</p><p>Now let me start by talking about the last few years. We have consistently delivered strong performance. In fiscal year '17, we issued guidance at the beginning of the year. We beat the number. In fiscal year '18, we did the same thing. Fiscal year '19, we did the same thing. And this chart, I wanted to put up because this consistent record of profit improvement is a pretty good picture of how our view of ourselves is that we should be able to execute year in and year out.</p><p>There is one blemish on this chart, which I hate, and it's that $179 million number. And the reason I wanted to point that out, first of all, it jumps -- it stands out in a record of consistent profit growth. But the main reason I wanted to point that out because I take personal responsibility for that. That year, we had about 80 -- I don't remember the number off the top of my head, but I think it was $80 million or $90 million of profit impact from currency changes in Europe or relative currency changes in Europe. And at the time, I think we gave ourselves too much leeway to address that.</p><p>Now I have to say, investors seem to respect the way we executed it, because our stock price went up right through it. But we -- I believe we could have done better than that, we could have seen growth even in that year. I wanted to show that because this is the expectation I have for our company. When we face difficult challenges, I don't care if they're -- even if they're macroeconomic and not directly a result of anything we're doing, I believe we should be able to manage through those, including the coronavirus.</p><p>Now the next thing I want to do is I want to set up the rest of the day. You're going to hear from 3 different business leadership teams, 4 different people. And the first one is going to be Delphine. Now Delphine is going to talk to you -- and those of you who have been to our Analyst and Investor Day in Zurich will remember Delphine. Delphine has worked across different parts of our business -- a lot of different parts of our business, and she's come into our oldest business just recently. And she has brought a level of energy and insight that, honestly, I haven't seen somebody do with an old stale business in my entire career. So she's got the whole company as excited about this business as she is and I am, too.</p><p>Just one big advantage, which is a tailwind. And the tailwind probably surprises some people, but we've been in it for a while. So it doesn't surprise us. That tailwind is the reality that more and more people, especially more and more younger people, need a desk space to create. They're not creating spreadsheets for the most part, like many of you are. They're creating digital content and they're putting it up somewhere on Instagram, on YouTube or on Twitch, and they want a job in that. More and more of them want a job in that.</p><p>In fact, if you ask Gen Z, the under 25 generation, what job they'd like to have when they grow up, if they're not already grown up, most of them will say I'd like to be a YouTuber. If I had any choice in the world, I'd love to make a living broadcasting on YouTube. And the reality is, that really drives our business. So it's super exciting. They need a place where the products are beautiful, where the products work really well and where they can film themselves. Much of that's mobile, but much of it's not.</p><p>The second thing that -- the second reality that Delphine has really brought to the business is a real highlight on the fact that as people use these products more and more and on the other end of spectrum, especially those of us who get older, you end up with pain. Now we don't cause the pain, but the reality is, as you get older, as you mature and even if you're not older, repetitive use injuries come in. And so that means that there is an opportunity for us to address those issues ergonomically.</p><p>And we have done a great job recently of really understanding the ergonomics of this business, and Delphine will talk a little bit about it, and how we can bring new products, most of them are premium, to solve some of those issues. So we believe that this business is $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion business. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we certainly ought to be able to deliver at least a $1.5 billion business.</p><p>Next up, Ujesh, who has presented here, I think, almost every year since he joined the company. How many years have you been here Ujesh? 5 years. So Ujesh runs our Gaming business. And it's just -- the Gaming business I've talked about so much that I hesitate to go too far now, but I'm going to draw one chart. For those of you who are on audio, I apologize, I'm going to describe it to you. The chart is really simple. A lot of you may have seen me do this before here.</p><p>Yes. Okay. So this chart is really simple. Okay. On the -- up here is their age. So this is age, you've got 80-year-olds, 60-year-olds, 40-year-olds, 20-year-olds and lower. And down here is the percentage of that age group. Now if you go back to regular sports, traditional sports, sports like football or basketball, soccer in the U.S., almost everybody played or plays, either by choice or by force, some kind of traditional sport. If you're an 80-year-old, you played something, probably more by choice and by force, but you played something. And today, if you're 40 or 20, in school you're playing something, you're required to for PE class. So bottom line is everybody's playing a traditional sport.</p><p>So this is the world of traditional sports participation. And that translates into -- the traditional sport, that translates into viewership because you're familiarity with playing those sports translates into an interest in watching those sports, sometimes watching other sports just because you got started. So this is the world of traditional sports, and this is the reason why companies like Nike and adidas and the NFL and the Premier League are so big because the truth is everybody's playing, everybody is familiar and everybody is interested. And even if you're not a fan, you know it, you feel familiar with it.</p><p>Now let's talk about eSports. Some of you who are listening or watching this are thinking eSports, that's not even a sport. Why are they -- why are we using the word sport for that? So if you're 80, you never played a video game. If you're 60, you probably never played a video growing up -- sorry, growing up. When you get a little younger, 50 a few people did, 40 more and more. And then this line goes like that. Everybody. So this is the world of eSports.</p><p>So why am I drawing this chart and pointing out that it's really young people who play these sports? I'm doing that because this little sliver down here results in more people watching people play games online, like Premier League and regular sports or the NFL, more people are watching people play online than are watching CNN, CNBC, HBO and Netflix combined. Just this little slide.</p><p>Now the reason why that's important is because look what's going to happen next. Over the next 5 and 10 and 15 and 20 years, all those people are going to grow up and they're going to look more and more like this. So the world of eSports is going to be bigger than the world of traditional sports over time, and that secular tailwind is driving our business. And our goal, Ujesh's goal, is to turn us into a Nike -- or the Nike or adidas of the eSports world.</p><p>And so you'll hear from him. What you won't hear from him is that we're working directly with some of the top eSports teams in the world. Just like AC Barcelona (sic) [FC Barcelona] in football or the San Francisco 49ers in American football. But we're working directly with these eSports teams, and we're doing a lot of stuff we're not going to talk about today, one of the choices we made, to help be a part, an integral part of the fabric of the eSports future.</p><p>The second thing that's driving this business, the second tailwind, secular tailwind which is maybe even more exciting, is there's this amazing thing called the cloud, which everybody in this room knows. The cloud has now reached gaming, and it's now reaching -- just starting to reach PC gaming. And in some ways, it's already been there.</p><p>The reason why PC gaming has taken off over the past few years is because basically, the game is always changing. The number of people is almost unlimited who could play simultaneously and that's because games are on the cloud. What's not happened until now is that if you really wanted to be competitive in gaming, you needed to be -- buy a big honking PC, expensive, [full of] processing power with an amazing video card. You needed that because to play some of these games just took a lot of power and a lot of energy.</p><p>Well, cloud gaming is coming. And cloud gaming is going to enable you to not have to spend all that money on the PC and to be able to play on a screen, almost anywhere, but what you're still going to need is the conventional sport equivalent of the ball or the cleats, the shoes or the jersey. You're going to need peripherals. You're going to need a mouse and a keyboard and a headset. So this is coming. It's early days.</p><p>And then there's mobile gaming, which honestly, we're not participating in. So stay tuned. We're always looking. So gaming is super exciting. And there's no way that we should not deliver $1 billion over the next 3 to 5 years in that business. If we deliver and we execute, we should absolutely deliver at least that.</p><p>A third business you're going to hear about, first from Scott Wharton and then from Ehrika Gladden, is video. And this is an interesting time to talk about this business. Video, I only have one word on here, which is video everywhere. When I started on Logitech about almost 8 years ago, it's going to be 8 years ago in about 30 days, we were doing -- we were in trouble, and Guerrino remember this very well, and we went through and looked at all of the operational headcount, all the engineering, all the G&amp;A, everything. And we got to this little group that was called video. And we had $10 million investment in headcount on the engineering side, and the business was on a strong secular decline.</p><p>And I called in the head of that business, and I said, now this was a ploy, I'll tell you upfront, I said to him -- and I said, \"What are we going to do with this?\" Because if -- I'm not going to invest in a secular declining business. We're either going to cut it or we're going to do something new with it. And I said, \"It's your choice. We either chop it or we do something new with it.\" I said, \"You think about it over the weekend. Let's talk on Monday.\" His name was Eric Kintz. He came back on Monday morning, he said, \"There's no way we should cut this.\" He said we should grow it, we should create some new businesses, new seeds and we should really go after it. And that's what we did.</p><p>And since then, he was 100% right. The video business has been super exciting. And from that very early start, we've built product after product. And Scott is going to take you through where we are from a product portfolio standpoint. We've gone from that little webcam that we started with many years ago to today where we can do almost any size room for almost any size company or for an individual sitting in China who's quarantined in their home.</p><p>The second thing we're going to talk about in the context of this business is execution. Now Ehrika Gladden is brand new to our company. She'll introduce herself. So I won't steal her thunder, but we've really -- we're now to the point where we've built out a sales force, we've got the right -- probably the right numbers, now we've got to upgrade our execution. And I'll let her speak for herself, or for herself and for us, on what we need to do there, and I think there's a lot of opportunity.</p><p>So those are the 3 big businesses you're going to hear about today. We'll spend sufficient time on that. You'll have time for Q&amp;A. I just want to remind you of a few things that are really driving our business over the past few years. The first one is, we've talked at every -- the last 3 or 4 of these Analyst/Investor Days about 5 core capabilities.</p><p>The first one is operations. I'm really proud of our operations group and the way we execute. You're going to hear a little bit about that later in the context of sustainability and the environmental sustainability. Well, I'll say a few more things now. I have to admit, I would have been surprised if -- I would have not been surprised if you told me a year ago that if you face -- if we faced tariffs where we needed to move a large amount of our manufacturing and we faced cost headwinds driven by currency, and later faced a real supply crisis, that I would have said, \"Gosh, something's got to give. We don't have the room to manage that and do the same kind of execution of NPI, new products that we do every day.\" But our operations team is just amazing and they have pulled it off. And I think it's a real testament to the powerhouse leadership we've got there.</p><p>The second thing I'm going to talk about in a few minutes is design. So I'll give you an update on where I think we are with design and what's next.</p><p>Engineering. The thing I'll say about engineering, and I'll show you a slide in a second, is our engineering is shifting. We've gone from hiring lots and lots of hardware engineers to make hardware products, to more and more software engineers to create the software that connects to products either directly as part of the experience that you buy when you buy a hardware product or even over time, as you're going to see, we're going to be offering services that are independent of a product.</p><p>From a go-to-market standpoint, we continue -- one thing I'll say about Logitech is it's always changing. We're always experimenting with new things. We're always trying something different. Well, many of those things are steps along the way to something bigger. And on the go-to-market side, the sales force side, we've got a lot of things in the works that I think will continue to upgrade and improve our ability to execute online, in store and in businesses.</p><p>And then finally, marketing. Several people today will kind of either talk directly about or suggest that we're moving to more and more of a pull model, away from a push model, which means more and more marketing-driven and less and less promotion and distribution-driven. This is fundamental to what we're all about. We're not going to give a deep update on that today. But over time, you'll see our marketing will get stronger and stronger.</p><p>On the design side, I started talking about design within -- actually, before I joined the company. When I first interviewed with Logitech, one of the reasons why Guerrino and the Board at the time picked me was because I came out of Braun, or Braun. And Braun was really a design company that happen to be making technology products. And that's very much what I envision that we could be. We always were good at design, but we didn't have any designers in-house, at least not officially. And I envisioned that Logitech could be a design company.</p><p>Now the cool thing about being lucky, I guess, is that because of where I came from, that seemed obvious to me because if you've been in my job running Braun, you would have said, \"Oh, my gosh, what's the world missing? Every company should be a design company.\" When I came to Logitech, one of the first slides we showed at one of these Analyst/Investor Days was a slide that showed the growth of design companies, companies like Nike, companies like Apple, the growth of design companies and market value relative to the growth of other companies. And if I remember correctly, it was about 270% higher than the average company. And that was way before we could say we have really become much of a design company.</p><p>Roll forward, we're now, I would say, a lot of the way there. I think we're in a pretty elite group now of companies that really do have very strong design operations and run themselves by design. And I'll talk about in a minute, we're nowhere near what we can be in that area. But boy, have we made a lot of progress, This is -- this chart here is just to say what McKinsey just recently talked about, they've really -- as it happens in the business world, when things work, a lot of the consulting firms, McKinsey in particular, look at what's working and then they really go deeply analyze it and start to talk about it and they want to help other companies go there. We're held up in their most recent report as an example of a company that's really gotten there from a design standpoint. What they don't realize is that how much further we have to go.</p><p>We continue to win design awards. This is one example. Awards don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. What they do, though, is they perfectly or they accurately depict what our emphasis is. By winning design awards, we're really showing the world how important design is to us, and we win design awards across almost every product category. But the design awards are given for products that you, as users, buy and experience.</p><p>The next opportunity for us in design is to not only continue to improve that across every single product line, believe me we've got lots of headroom for improvement from a product experience standpoint, but to go beyond that. What this chart shows is that most companies are still in this first space, call it Design 1.0, making products beautiful. That's -- the world still sees design as a pursuit of perfection and aesthetic beauty, and that's probably because of the fashion world and probably because that's kind of where most companies are.</p><p>Enlightened companies are in the second stage. And I would say that's where we are. And they are really building the product, the experience that they're selling, around the user they're selling to. And what -- that means, essentially, they're taking the experience, they're starting with the users, sitting them at a table in our case, and starting to build the experience around them. And viewing the experience more broadly than just a physical product, in our case, but all the way through the experience that includes the software and the services and more. And that's where we are. And we're probably near the top of our competitive set for that, but we still have a lot of room to grow there.</p><p>The third area is really, really interesting, and I think it will be fun to watch over the next decade. And that's when companies bring design into everything: design into the way they close their books at the end of the quarter, design into the way that they have a Board meeting, design in the way they operate everything, design into a meeting like this. And as that happens, it's going to change the business world again in a big way, and we're starting down this path right now, and I'm super excited about it.</p><p>Now you know the story about where we play. This is our current way of aggregating our businesses. But the reality is we're now 28 or 29 different categories of businesses. So we keep building. As you know, if you followed us for long, we're always experimenting with new categories on a regular basis. Sometimes that experimentation leads to a product launch or a new category launch. Sometimes it leads to an acquisition. Because we've informed ourselves enough about that new category, we've gotten them excited enough about it, we have enough understanding about it to actually do an investment and make a bet and go after it. Streamlabs is an example of that.</p><p>And you know that we're not going to be limited by the brands that we have. If we believe that our capability can take us into categories and spaces with big potential, we're going to be there. And so that sometimes will mean we'll add brands and build new brands in our portfolio.</p><p>But this simple chart is just to say that you -- many of the people who follow us, most of you, see us as a hardware company, and we are a hardware company. Hardware is not easy. We love hardware. And everything in our company is oriented to make sure that we execute well on the hardware front. One of the reasons why we've been able to consistently deliver is we haven't stumbled into some of the problems that hardware companies do, which is over-forecasting demand and having really big write-offs. Why are we not doing that, in the 8 years that I've been here, at least not in a big way, 2 reasons.</p><p>One is because we've learned through it. We've had that in our past, just like every hardware company has. And so we've learned our way through how to manage that, how to manage that risk. We're not perfect. And because we're not perfect, we have a second advantage in that area, which is we have a very broad portfolio. A very broad portfolio means some things can have issues and some things don't, but when you aggregate it together, and Nate's going to talk about this later, we do pretty well.</p><p>But the thing that you're going to see quietly develop over the next few years that we started about a year ago, 2 years ago, is we're going to turn that software investment in engineering into services. Super early days, but if you dig a little deeper into our business, you'll see that almost every one of our businesses now has software developing, either explicitly as part of the product experience when you buy it or potentially as a new service and even a recurring revenue service. So this is coming. I don't want you to over -- I don't want to over-forecast this. I just want to say, we're super excited about this, we're committed to it 100% and it will start to develop over time.</p><p>Now I want to close with a quick comment about a couple of things. First of all, organizationally, one of the reasons why we've been able to weather a lot of these surprising macroeconomic storms is because of the way we operate as a company. We have gone from -- I think when I joined the company, we had really 2 large business groups. Today, we have, it depends on how you count it, 8 or 9. And the truth is, as I said, we have 29 different categories of business. That distribution has enabled us to be relatively flat. And the advantages of being flat are -- there are many advantages.</p><p>First, it gives you -- it makes communication fast. Inside our company, people feel pretty informed pretty quickly. The second advantage of being flat is that you have a lot of small teams with a lot of independence. And we're not taking big risk by giving them independence because we have 28 or 29 different teams. We have 1 culture, 28 or 29 different teams. So that's enabled us to move fast on things that larger companies and companies that are organized in a very hierarchical way struggle with. The combination of those 2 things makes us faster, more flexible and more fun, and it shows up in our -- in the engagement survey results we do.</p><p>Now I want to transition to the next topic. And I want to try to bridge from here. One thing that's showing up big time from our employees is environmental sustainability. It's gone from being kind of an interesting topic for a few zealots to it's an important topic for the majority of the people who work in Logitech. Now it's so important to us, to me, and to our leadership team and to our Board that we've made it a top priority in the company. And that we didn't start this yesterday. We started this many years ago, as Prakash will show you. But boy, are we making a headway right now. It is super, super exciting.</p><p>I believe that the same steps we took in design 8 years ago, they have transformed the company, the same process we used we're applying a similar process now. And I don't know if we'll see as big a transformation from business results, but I believe we'll see as big or bigger a transformation in the way we think about our business and the impact we're having on the world. We not only want to lead ourselves to a better environmental place, but we want to be one of the leaders in business. And as you'll see, I think we're starting there.</p><p>So Prakash, who runs our operations group, is going to come up now and talk about sustainability, but I want to make a point before he does. The reason why Prakash is in charge of sustainability are 2 reasons. The most important one is that he has responsibility for all of our operations in the company, for our manufacturing, for the 140 million things a year that we make that potentially could end up in a landfill somewhere, unrecycled, for all the energy that's required to make those things and all the energies that's required to move our people from one place to another one. So he's got direct responsibility for all of it, and now he has direct responsibility for offsetting all of it. Now that's a choice.</p><p>The second -- the reason -- the second reason we made that choice is not only because of his role but because of his passion. There's not a single person in the company who is -- who believes more in this than Prakash, although maybe we're tied. And there are a lot of people who believe in it, so maybe I'm sort of shifting a lot of people here. So I'm really excited about what we're up to. I couldn't help but start to talk about this now because we've made so much headway before we started to talk publicly about it. And I refused to let anybody talk publicly about sustainability until the last few months, but I am incredibly excited about how far we've already come and wait until you see what's next, including what we're not going to talk about today. So, Prakash?</p><p>PRAKASH ARUNKUNDRUM, HEAD OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS, LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL S.A.: Great. Good morning. Thank you, Bracken. I would want to start with 3 takeaways for you that I want you to take away from here. As Bracken said, this is a priority for us. I'm super passionate about it. Second thing, we are doing this because of the way we are structured in operations. And I'm looking at it, we have the ability to make an impact. And what that means for financial folks here that are looking at numbers is we're going to do this in a way in which it's going to be actually better and lesser costly and have a better impact, and I'll walk through some of those examples. And the third thing that I want to say that you should take away from here is we've been doing this a long time. So while I think we're talking about it today, we've actually been doing this for quite a number of years. So I want to actually start you off with a little video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>PRAKASH ARUNKUNDRUM: Great. That was a sneak preview of what we've been up to, what we are going to do next. And what I want to do today is actually walk you through a little bit more about this, right? So we have a very unique focus on sustainability. We call it the footprint and the handprint. Footprint is certainly what you leave behind on earth. And here, we are really looking at our products and reimagining cradle to grave. How to make them, as Bracken talked about, looking at where we have landfill all the way to where we source. And on the handprint, it's really impacting for social good. We've been doing this for a number of years. But first, I want to talk to you about what we've actually done here.</p><p>So back in 2007, we actually signed what's called the RBA Code of Conduct. And this is essentially applying human rights, good working conditions. We audit 100% of our suppliers. We make sure that the environment that they work in is good. And it's above the law in the sense that it's a universal code of conduct. We're not sticking to a code of conduct for a particular country, but a universal code of conduct. So we've been doing this for a long time, well over a decade.</p><p>The second thing we've been doing is actually being transparent about our goals and publishing progress, and you've probably seen our Sustainability Report. We've been publishing that since 2012. And the third thing, I think I just talked about is our handprint/footprint focus, which we really earnestly started 3 years ago. We've been talking about it in that way internally, but externally, we started talking about it 3 years ago. And where we are really going next is what I like to call pervasiveness. And pervasiveness in the sense that we have, for a long time, as you could see, really focused on sustainability internally. We're now starting to advocate with partners externally. And it's also what our brand is going to stand for, it's a big part of the culture within Logitech.</p><p>So what is pervasiveness, right? And we call it pervasive sustainability. At Logitech, it's a mindful principle that we apply to everything we do. It starts at the leadership team level, goes all the way down to anyone working on anything from design, operations, finance, design from a business perspective, the business units. But this also comes back up in the sense that we have ideas coming from all across the company. And we are starting to do this with our partners and suppliers. And we, one day, hope to actually influence the industry to do more here from an electronics perspective. So that's what pervasive sustainability means for us.</p><p>And one of the things that we -- I'm very proud to note here is that our leadership, while we've been doing this for a number of years, is finally getting recognized. Sustainalytics actually just recently declared us a leader in this category. So we are 2 out of 142 tech companies in the environment from a rating perspective. And some of you probably follow Sustainalytics, and that's 96th percentile overall. We also got rated by Morgan Stanley, AA rated, which is literally their top rating. There is nothing beyond the AA rating. And that's, again, a recognition of what we do on the environment, on the social side and on the governance side as a company.</p><p>We're also the first company from a consumer electronics perspective to win an award from a magazine called the World Finance magazine, and we're the only tech company to win it last year. And there is more, right? And there's more. EcoVadis. We also got listed on the FTSE4Good Index. So we're getting recognized, and I think that's part of the fact that we've been working on this for many years.</p><p>So why does it matter to you, right? Why should you care about sustainability? Firstly, all of you know here, so I wouldn't bother to even talk about it, ESG ratings matter, right? And they influence how you make investments. They influence how you make investments as investors. It also influences personally how you make investment choices. The second thing Bracken talked about is consumer brands. And not just consumer brands, when you go out to a grocery store, you go out to buy a car, this is now in our stream of consciousness and it's starting to happen with electronics. More sustainable brands get recognized more, and we're going to start seeing that more and more in electronics.</p><p>The third thing, which is a bit counterintuitive, is sustainable products sustainable products actually drive costs down, and I'll talk about a few examples of how we are doing this. The fourth thing that's happening is climate regulation. I think some of you might have heard of Green New Deal. There is talk of carbon pricing. Well, those are things that may be a little bit out there. But already, in Europe, there is energy regulation. It's called ErP, that's in place. We're adhering to it. It's calling upon electronics, not just appliances, to have better energy efficiency. So this has already started.</p><p>And the last point here is really for us internally, sustainably attracts great talent. Not only attracts great talent, it allows us to keep great talents, especially as we look at millennials and the next generation, this is a key topic for a lot of them. And for those of you in the audience who have kids, it just makes the world a better place for the future. And this is the reason why we are really passionately focused about this topic, as Bracken talked about.</p><p>So what did we say? You saw in the video a lot of things. But I want to call out one big thing that we actually called out there, which is our commitment. And our commitment to actually support the Paris Agreement and really have a 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C climate pledge. So what's 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C climate pledge? So the International Panel of Climate Change (sic) [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] actually declared that preindustrial era to now, we need to be at a warming stage no more than 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C. We're already at about 1 to 1.2\u00c2\u00b0C. We need to be at 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C if we don't want to see a lot of the things from a climate risk perspective. This was a call to action for countries.</p><p>We actually took this, and we said, as a company, we're going to ladder up to this. So what is laddering up to 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C mean for a company like us? If you really look at our -- this chart here, our carbon footprint, which is today somewhere about here, what this means is we need to bring it down to 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C world, which is nearly 0, that's what we need to do, and over the next 30 years, by 2050.</p><p>Now as Bracken said, long term, we're really serious about this. That's why I have a chart here that looks all the way out to 2050. Very few times we actually do this, looking out all this way. And one of the pledges we made, as you probably saw in the video, is actually getting to 100% renewable electricity by 2030. And we're going to do that through what's here in green, what's called Design for Sustainability. And this is really applying the design culture we have at Logitech that's worked for us, applying it next to sustainability. And what we're going to do here between 2020 and 2050 is to actually get on this glide path. And I'll show you a few examples of how we are getting there and what we are doing to actually get to this net reduction in carbon.</p><p>So what's Design for Sustainability. Design for Sustainability is an umbrella term. It really hits 3 points. Ecodesign, which is reducing the environmental impact of products. Circular design, keeping materials in use. And I'll give a few examples of this long beyond their linear consumption, essentially taking things out of landfill and reusing them to make new products and new materials. And the last one, doing social good. I'm going to spend a little time on that today in the interest of time. But I want to start with Ecodesign.</p><p>So what is the Ecodesign? So if you look at any of our products, it starts with materials, making the right materials choices. As some of you might have seen in our sustainability report, we have avoided conflict minerals. Conflict minerals are tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold that come from conflict zones. We've avoided them. We're nearly at 100% in a lot of them. And this requires us to look beyond our Tier 1 supply chain.</p><p>We've also avoided a lot of targeted substances, hazardous substances. We're part of what's called RoHS and REACH, which are 2 environmental regulations. And really bearing that in mind, we've actually put in place responsible manufacturing, which is looking at how do we make manufacturing in a place where we take care of things like human rights, environment, the labor and, of course, being energy efficient.</p><p>We've also talked about packaging in the past in our sustainability report, but I'm going to give you a few examples of this. Really thinking about recyclability as we make new products. Thinking about durability, so that the products we make last a long time. And a lot of the Logitech products already last a long time, but this is something that we're going to do more and more of. And really thinking about how we inform consumer choices with labeling. How we enable a smarter society with some of our products like Video Collaboration. And really spending some dollars in research and innovation of the next-generation materials. And lastly, efficiency, really keeping that in mind in terms of energy efficiency.</p><p>So I'm going to give you a few examples. But first, I want to say that we can do a lot of the things we're doing because we built some unique capabilities. We can now tell you with our -- this is a set of product capabilities that we've built. And we can tell you right now if you bought a Logitech mice, how many kgs of carbon is in it? So that when we are going to make the next mice or the next keyboard, we make sure that we actually look at the product impact and adjust accordingly. As part of making electronics, PCBs, or printed circuit boards, are a big part of the carbon contribution. And we've built a calculator to figure out how to actually impact PCB impact and reduce it. And a lot more capabilities that we've built that's uniquely Logitech. It's something that we've applied to our products.</p><p>Let me give you a few examples in Ecodesign. And the idea here that I'm going to repeat a few times, is less but better. So what you see here G Pro wireless mice, which we launched a year ago. And one of the things we did was to apply all the things I talked about from an Ecodesign perspective. We completely rethought the thin wall design for the plastics. We reduced the weight of the springs and the tension in the springs. We redid the spoke wheel. We actually reduced the size of the PCB, which reduces carbon. We changed out the battery, which reduces carbon. We put a new sensor in, it's called the HERO sensor, which actually extends energy life.</p><p>And doing this, actually, we improved performance for the gamers. We made it lighter, so they could perform better. It's better rated than the predecessor, it's 4.3 stars on Amazon. 20% -- almost 20% less carbon. And it costs less. So it's less, but better. And this is really what we're trying to do from an Ecodesign perspective.</p><p>I'm going to give you another example. We designed lower-carbon packaging. What you see here is MX Master 3, the packaging for it. We increased the recyclability of this packaging. We use what's called Forest-certified paper, which is from forests that are actually renewable in the sense that they are protected forests. We have higher water -- lower water usage, lower carbon. And not only did we do all these things, this packaging, Bracken talked about design awards, was one of the few packaging awards that we won from a design perspective as well.</p><p>And we didn't do this once, we've done this across quite a few number of products. And you see here carbon reduction ranging from 50% down to 20%. Again, less but better. Less carbon, better cost. And every time we reduce the size of packaging, the amount of money you're going to spend shipping it is lesser. The amount of carbon is lesser. And we're still delivering the same premium touch and feel for our products that you see.</p><p>One of the big things that I talked about is circular design. And really, we are rethinking our supply chain to go from a linear supply chain where you source, manufacture, distribute, put it in the hands of consumers. And then it goes to end of life, it goes to landfill. And we're really rethinking how do you take it back from the grave and bring it back to the cradle. Of course, it starts with longevity and repair, so increasing the life of our products. Taking some of these products back and reusing them, actually remanufacturing. But perhaps the hardest of them all is recycling, what is end of life, and we've done just that.</p><p>So last year, we actually launched our first and the world's first recycled mice and webcam. So what did we do here? We actually took landfill that went from e-waste, electronics waste, extracted the plastics from the landfill, transported it to our factories, made resin out of it, from that resin shot new parts, which you see in our C930 webcam and our M275 mouse, and it's 80% net reduction in carbon. And we just started with these 2 products last year and we're going to do this more. And it costs the same. It costs exactly the same. The same principle applies. Again, less but better.</p><p>So I want to move on and talk about our factory. Our factory, as you probably saw in the video, is actually carbon-neutral. We did a number of things in terms of efficiency improvement. We improved the air conditioning with chillers. We actually use hot water recycling from a nearby wastewater plant. We installed last year -- sorry, 2 years ago, renewable electricity. So we buy electricity from a wind farm off of Pudong in our factory in Suzhou. And it's large-scale metering, so it's actually clean energy. And by doing this and all the green activities we have done, we've taken out 17,000 tonnes of carbon, just in our factory. And our factory is net zero carbon.</p><p>We did exactly the same with travel. So our carbon from our travel, corporate travel, the travel that a lot of us took flights to get here from California, is also carbon-neutral. And again, we're doing this -- and you're not seeing anything on your P&amp;Ls because we're doing this in a way in which it is actually less but better.</p><p>And we did this actually across what's considered the biggest growth category that -- one of the biggest growth categories that Bracken talked about, gaming. Gaming is now carbon-neutral. So what did we do here? We actually, as I spoke about, we Design for Sustainability to cut a whole bunch of carbon. And what we couldn't take out, we've actually invested in forestry. And some of you might be thinking, forest? Why would you do that? Well, forests are the best-known vehicle for sucking carbon dioxide out to the atmosphere. An average tree, that's a full-grown tree that you can hug, takes out about 5 kilograms of carbon a year when it's mature.</p><p>And we've taken what we can't take out today, which we are -- as I showed you earlier, we are on a right path to actually taking out. What we can't take out today, we have offset with investments in rainforest, in Brazil, Indonesia and other places, to do exactly that, to suck out carbon dioxide. So that the net impact of carbon from our products is neutralized. So when you go out there and buy a gaming product from Logitech, it's the only company that has gaming peripherals that is carbon-neutral today. And we really hope we are not -- we are the first ones, but actually everybody else joins us here because it's not about just us.</p><p>So I just want to recap, we're really doing 3 things if you step back and look at what we're doing. We're reducing the amount of carbon from a Design for Sustainability perspective to hit a 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C world. We're using renewables. We have a pledge to get to 100% renewable electricity by 2030. And we're going to restore. What we can't reduce and renew immediately, we're going to restore by protecting forests and some climate-impacted communities through certified offsets. So we're just getting started, and I think there's a lot happening here. But as I said, we're designing for sustainability and shaping a better world. And this is what I'm super passionate about.</p><p>So with that, I'm going to introduce Delphine next to talk about Creativity &amp; Productivity. Delphine?</p><p>DELPHINE DONNE-CROCK, GENERAL MANAGER OF CREATIVITY &amp; PRODUCTIVITY, LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL S.A.: Thank you, Prakash. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining, and I'm really excited to talk about Creativity &amp; Productivity. I feel very blessed to have this opportunity, and it's been a really fun ride.</p><p>So I will share with you more what we've been doing in the past couple of years now I have taken the lead of this group. And I want to try to address with you the question I get a lot, can C&amp;P, Creativity &amp; Productivity, keep growing. Actually, if we look at the past 4 years, we have been growing at a steady CAGR of about 6%. And there is a lot for us to continue delivering very steady growth moving forward. And I want to share with you a little bit how we will continue.</p><p>Most people love Logitech for great design and experience. And this is -- I'm very proud of all the products that the team has launched this year. But what is very important for us is how we focus to help people create and communicate. It's not about the product itself that we deliver, it's really about the experience that we are trying to deliver at this space where people get things done with the favorite app you're using. Everybody has to go back -- we can use the phone during the day, but when we start having something we really want to get done, we have to go back to a space where you have a bigger screen and you can really get focused into your content. And that's what we are passionate about. It's really helping people create and communicate.</p><p>And it's not just about selling one more product to a consumer, it's really creating a full ecosystem of solutions, products, hardware, services that will help you stay focused and deliver the best possible creative content in the cloud. So that's really what we care about, that's what my team is passionate about and we focus on every day.</p><p>Now we are also in a great position in the sense of what's happening on top of the products that we are selling and the category we're in. There is a really strong trend in digital creativity, productivity and communication. If you look at the number of applications that people use every day, it can be -- for some people it's going to be about office suites, for some others it's going to be about Linux for your software coding. But for others, it's going to be YouTube and creating video content that you're going to be uploading.</p><p>What we see is that in the past 5 years, the usage among this digital cloud application has increased by 3x since 2015. So it's a fantastic opportunity where more content is created every day. And what is fascinating as well is that if you look at the profile -- so if you are an adult, about 25% of the usage is on creative application. But the younger you get, the more this creativity apps grow in usage. So millennials is 32%. If you look at Gen Z, it goes up to 43%. I mean it's really fascinating to know that every second on YouTube, there's 8 hours of content that is created. And to create that content -- 8 hours of content that is uploaded on YouTube.</p><p>And what is really important is that there is a time you need during the week, during the day, where you need to go back to that space and use our products. Because if you take a laptop, for example, yes, we can all go around and use the laptop and the touch pad, but as soon as you start going back to the space where you need to create your content, if you raise a little bit your laptop, you need a keyboard, to be very comfortable you need a mouse. If you're working from home, you want a webcam. And obviously, right now, it's a great opportunity for us to help people to really engage in digital activities that they are doing.</p><p>But the other aspect as well, and one of the question I get on a regular basis, is do young people who use mouse, for example. And all our research shows that 80% of young people in between the age of 18 to 25 use a mouse. So great opportunity. People need to have more content to create. Our products are highly relevant. And the beauty on top of this is that we have more people to engage with. It's not just engaging with people who are between 30 to 45 years old. Now obviously, everybody is using a computer, either for school homework, web-based learning, all the way to all our parents are using a computer now and creating all sorts of activities in the cloud. So the reach of the people we can engage with is growing every day.</p><p>If we look at Gen Zs, for example, it's more than 2 billion people we can engage with. It's absolutely -- I mean, I can't be more excited to lead this business because the biggest challenge I have, and generally, the conversation I have with Nate is more about how I prioritize all the opportunities we have than the other challenges. So really proud of where we are.</p><p>Now in terms of our design strategy, it's really about putting people first. Bracken touched on this, and it's really at the core of everything we do. We focus on very specific consumer because one size does not fit all. If you look at, for example, a lady in China versus a -- who is doing all sorts of broadcast, YouTube activities or YouKu activities or Tudou Alibaba engagement, it's going to be very different than the software developers in Germany that is really looking at creating the best it could possible and staying focused for quite a few hours.</p><p>And this really precise targeting we can do helps us to understand better the target audience, what are they doing, how they use the product, how we can help them create and performing better. It's really what we are. It's at the core of all our innovation. And it helps us to deliver much better products, but also engage with the audience in a way that makes a lot of sense for them.</p><p>So if we look at, for example, video content creators. All this audience and young people who wants to become YouTube stars, as Bracken mentioned, they want to create content that represent their passion. And then they want to engage with an audience that will care about what they want to talk about, and they want to share that passion. But at the same time, we have to remember that most of the time, you can't see the environment of these people. They're going to be putting themselves out there in front of people they don't even know most of the time. And so they want to be at their best. They want their ecosystem in where they are -- to represent who they are. So it's very important that these products are not only really easy to use, so they can focus on the task they are trying to do, but they're also beautiful at the right price. And really help them create this environment that they are looking for.</p><p>And all this focus on really specific audience and understanding the differences from one consumer to another has helped us to deliver this year a lot of really strong products. We've had amazing reviews, ratings and engagement with our consumers which is helping our performance really nicely. But it's important, as Bracken said, it's not just about the product, it's really about how the whole experience come together. If you look at the MX Master series, we want to help software developers, engineers to stay focused all day. We're not just a mouse and keyword for them, we are actually the tools they use to do their job every day. And it's a great opportunity for us to create this ecosystem of solutions, but the software that is helping them to focus is also critical.</p><p>And when you look at our software Logitech Options, Logitech Flow, we get amazing feedback from software developers on this because it really helps them to customize, saves time, depending on the application they work in. So for them it's not about just plug and play, it's really about the ability to be able to customize their products. And at the same time, if you look at YouTube or video content creators, well, they want to make that journey for them of creation as simple and as easy as possible.</p><p>And today, if you want to be in a YouTube world, there is a lot of tutorial you can read to know how to do it. It's fairly complex. And with Logitech Capture, we've been able to launch a software solution that was really easy to use. Anyone who wants to move from mobile phone to creating more advanced content at their desktop, they can do it easily with our solutions. So that's really a very important journey for them -- for us to help consumers to create better.</p><p>What is even more rewarding. If you look at our ergonomic solutions that we've launched this year, it's actually -- ergonomics is a very complex science and there is a lot to understand, especially when people are -- my hand size are very different from Bracken. The type of products that work are going to be very different. And it's really important for us to understand all this dynamic.</p><p>But when we manage to combine this expertise, science, design and helping consumers to perform at their best, what is the most rewarding is when we have people telling us, \"You know what, I don't feel pain anymore. I've been using your products and I don't feel pain anymore.\" And 18% of people who use a computer every day expressed, in the U.S., pain. They have some discomfort. And we have a lot of testimonial of people saying that since they've been using our products, they don't feel anything anymore. So it's really powerful.</p><p>And when they love our products so much, it gives us a great opportunity to create a strong engagement. And if you love our products at home, you would probably want exactly the same solution at work, and that's also a huge opportunity for consumer brands to the relevant at home and to be relevant at work.</p><p>So again, I feel really excited about all the opportunities because we can really bring together the products and the experience we deliver, the brand and really engaging with consumers about the passion, what they're passionate about and helping them perform better. And this has influenced also significantly how we even do our marketing and how we evolve from a push to pull marketing model.</p><p>If you look at the transformation we've had on our social platform, on Logitech global social platform, just being able to be more relevant for every audience we want to help, we've seen a massive growth of our engagement on our social platform. Between November 2018 and February 2020, the engagement on our social platform has increased by 300%. So we are becoming more relevant.</p><p>But it's also important that people get to know all the products and solutions we have. So we continue to engage with our authentic third-party voices. We have influences that are really happy to work with us and really talk about the product we have and the solution we have. But we also continue to have fantastic relationship with the media. And YouTube now is full of also tutorial about our products to help us reach the audience we want to connect with.</p><p>And I just want to show you, for example, one of our influencers, YouTuber influencer Kimberley Margarita. She's been key in our transformation and on understanding better video content creators. And I just want to show you this video about her.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>DELPHINE DONNE-CROCK: She has about 900,000 followers. She's passionate about makeup and engaging with the audience. And she needs the tools to really be at her best, to have the best possible quality and make this easily, so she can spend more time engaging with the audience and thinking about the next makeup she wants to do more than like the technical barriers she would have to go through. So this is where we really help her to make that journey very easy.</p><p>And for us, it's really important to communicate through very diverse channels. On one side, we have the owned channel that -- our social platform, our website we -- obviously, we create the content for. But it's also very important to engage with some influencers that are having a big reach, even if it means that there are times where we have to pay to be on this platform.</p><p>I'll give you an example of this Chinese influencer. So my name is Viya. She has about 16 million followers on Taobao, it's like massive. And she -- when we engaged with her, every time she posts something, she has about 20 million viewers. So you can imagine for us to have a reach in China and getting the visibility is absolutely critical. For Logitech Pebble, we did a partnership with her. In 1 minute, in 1 minute, she sold 10,000 units of Logitech Pebble. So it's very important for us to accelerate the awareness with all the consumers that don't necessarily know about our solution to also engage with this audience.</p><p>And then it's very important that we engage, obviously, to create this awareness with a different type of channel. But it's also how people will find our product on shelf, whether it's online or in stores. And the last thing you want to do is to go in store and look at a wave of products and being overwhelmed by the choice. You want someone to help you find the right products for you. And this is just an example that we've done in MediaMarkt in Germany and Fnac in France. We took -- we developed a partnership with our retailer, and it was not about putting more products on the shelf it was actually about reducing the amount of product on the shelf, so we could have better communication with our target audience and our consumers and users, and help them choose a better product for them. And our sales there have actually increased significantly since we've done this deployment in these specific stores.</p><p>So now for us, it's how we replicate these type of activities over and over again. So on one side, Logitech Creativity &amp; Productivity, we have 4 categories, a really steady, robust business. But we have the opportunity to go after unique audience that have very specific need again and again, create very deep insight, great innovation and engaging in a way that is more meaningful for them than trying to reach everyone at once.</p><p>So more than ever, I feel very strong about creativity and productivity. We have a great base of innovation, insights. Great technologic leadership, I mean, Logitech is compatible with all operating systems, all application is a peace of mind for us. But we also have this amazing scalable business where we can be in 100 countries, we can address consumers in China with specific needs, and we can also be in the U.S. or on any emerging markets we want to. So absolutely great opportunity. We have a fantastic formula, where we have a world out there of creating more content that we can really take advantage of because our products are more relevant, we have more consumers. And by driving a pull marketing in both consumer and B2B, we are developing ongoing recipe for further growth opportunities.</p><p>So I'm really glad I could share the progress we've made in our strategy today. And I will actually invite you to take a break before my friend, Ujesh, talk about exciting Gaming business. Thank you very much.</p><p>BEN LU: So thanks, everybody. I think we can take 10-minute break, even though we started a little bit late. So hopefully, we'll reconvene here in 10 minutes. And for those online, you can log back on if you want to take a short break. And for anybody who's here who wants to try to race car, I can ensure you, it's a lot of fun.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>BEN LU: All right. Thanks, everybody. We're going to start our session again. We'll have Ujesh just talked about Gaming, we'll have Scott talk a little bit about Video Collaboration and then Nate will end it with the financials, the outlook, and then we'll break it for into Q&amp;A. So Ujesh, it's all yours.</p><p>UJESH DESAI, VP &amp; GM OF LOGITECH GAMING, LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL S.A.: Is mic on? All right, there we go. So hi, everyone. My name is Ujesh and I manage the Gaming business here at Logitech. So I'm here to talk about why we think Gaming as a segment is going to continue to grow over the foreseeable future. So with that, why don't we get started.</p><p>So I thought I'd first start by talking about some of the long-term growth opportunities that we see in gaming. Today, and I'm going to say this number slowly, because I've said it last night, and Guerrino still couldn't believe it when I said it and he even said can you please repeat that again. There's 2.5 billion gamers in the world today. Just think about that number, 2.5 billion gamers, and they play across PC, console, mobile and now cloud is coming as well. And we believe this trend is going to continue for a number of reasons.</p><p>Starting with the PC, Bracken drew this chart up here, and he mentioned eSports. eSports continues to grow, continues to be mainstream. I have 2 daughters at home, they only watch football because their dad makes watch football. What they really like doing is watching their favorite gamers on Twitch, right, and YouTube. So that is really their choice of sport. So we're going to see that continue to drive growth in the PC space.</p><p>Second, console continues to remain a big growth area. Both Microsoft and Sony are launching brand-new consoles this year. So they're going to continue to invest in that space, that will continue to drive growth for us with gaming gear that attaches to those consoles. And then finally, in the cloud space, you have traditional players like Microsoft that are launching an amazing cloud gaming platform, but you have other folks entering this space, folks like Nvidia with their GeForce NOW offering and Google with Stadia.</p><p>And when you think of what cloud gaming will represent for us, it will enable AAA games to be played on either a phone, a tablet or even one of these entry-level laptops that you're using here. The benefit for us is if you want to game on that laptop, you're not going to use the track pad, you're going to need a gaming mouse. If you want to have good audio, you're going to want a gaming headset, right? So as this continues to grow, even with cloud, there's just more and more platforms that we'll be able to attach our gaming gear to, okay?</p><p>So today, I'm actually going to focus on one area. I'm going to focus on PC gaming and simulation, and talk about, as we roll here into FY '21, what are some of the short-term things we're going to do to drive growth this year. So let's get started there.</p><p>So the first thing is wireless leadership. If you've come to these editor's days or these analyst days in the past and you've heard me talk about wireless, you'll see that this is a journey that we've been on for the last 3 years. It started with our gaming mice. And what we did is we really did some major innovation in the wireless segment around our gaming mice, I'm going to talk about the benefits and the payoff we're seeing with those investments. But I'm also going to talk about how we're going to leverage those investments across our entire portfolio. So that's the first thing I'll talk about.</p><p>The second thing I'll talk about is the racing space. I don't know, some of you were trying to wheel back there during the break. I can definitely see a lot of New York drivers in what I saw back there, really, really good driving skills. But what we're seeing in the wheel space is this explosive growth as well because something like driving and racing is something everyone can do and enjoy. And we're going to enhance that even more. And we're building, and I'll talk about our own eRacing platform that we've created for gamers to come together that are passionate about driving and the virtual simulation world, and we're giving them an eSports platform where they can come together and compete. So I'll talk about that as well.</p><p>Let's first start with wireless. So if we look at our wireless gaming mice, there's a couple of things that we had to do to innovate. First, if you've heard of this notion of lag, a lot of gamers did not want to move to a wireless mouse because they are worried about the performance. So we had to solve that inherent issue. So what we did is we created the technology we call LIGHTSPEED. It's our own proprietary wireless technology. And what it enabled us to do is to build a wireless gaming mice or mouse that was actually faster than the competition's wired product. So that's unique to us, it's the first thing that we did.</p><p>The second thing we had to do is battery life. It doesn't do me any good if I have an amazingly high-performance mouse and I'm playing, and all of a sudden I'm in the battle what my teammates and then my mouse dies and I let everyone down. So we had to solve the battery life issues. So we invented a technology we call POWERPLAY. What POWERPLAY is electromagnetic resonance charging. So unlike a Qi charger where you place your phone or your mouse in one spot, and you have to leave it for a long period of time to get it to charge, ours is charging whether it's at rest or at play. You never ever have to worry about your battery life. So we've solved the battery issue. Once again, that is unique to us as well.</p><p>And then third, there's a component in your mouse that gives you that performance, and that's your sensor. That's what you use to track. That's what gamers rely on. Well, that is a very, very high performance, but in a lot of cases not a very efficient part of your gaming mouse. So we had to innovate and invent something new there, and that's where we came up with our HERO sensor. So it's uniquely ours. It has amazingly high performance, but it is extremely power-efficient and we uniquely have that. So these are some of the advances we made from an engineering standpoint. So that was number one.</p><p>But we didn't just stop there, part 2 is you have to educate the market. Tell gamers, one, why should you move to wireless; but two, why is our wireless better than the competition. So that's where we created a campaign that we call Play at LIGHTSPEED. And the idea was to educate gamers on why our wireless products were better than anything that was out there.</p><p>The next thing we did is it's one thing for us to talk about it, it's another thing for the industry experts in the world to talk about it. So a lot of the pro eSports teams, these are the folks that rely on the highest-performing products ever, they're now all moving to wireless because they see the benefit of untethering and not being stuck with a wired product. And not only are they seeing the benefit, they're actually winning tournaments. So more and more of the pros that we work with that have moved to our wireless products are now winning and named MVPs at all the different tournaments.</p><p>By the way, this product that you see here, this Pro Wireless mouse, is the same product that Prakash showed in his presentation, which was one of the first products we move for gaming to be way more sustainable. So once again, that sustainability story is helping us from a cost standpoint, it's helping the planet, but it's also improving performance, which is really important as well.</p><p>So the result of all this work that we've done here is if you look at our gaming mice market share in the last year, so from 2016, we went from roughly 30% market share to now we have well over 45% plus market share. So what that means is almost half the gamers in the world use a Logitech G gaming mouse, right? That's pretty impressive, but still we have a long ways to go to make that even better.</p><p>The next thing, though, is because our wireless products have a higher ASP than their wired counterparts, as we move to wireless, it's more than doubled our ASP, right? So we're driving increased revenue as well. But the last thing that I'll show here, which I think gets me the most excited, if you look at the adoption rate, how many gamers today are using a wireless gaming mouse, it's still very small. It's only a 25% adoption rate. But because of the technology that I talked about, LIGHTSPEED, POWERPLAY, our HERO sensor, within that 25% segment, we have 70% market share. So our technology leadership is what's driving that.</p><p>So what do we want to do next? Well, you just heard Delphine talk about the Creativity &amp; Productivity space. We'll look at the wireless adoption rate for Creativity &amp; Productivity. 83% of folks, in fact probably most of you here in the room, use a wireless creativity or productivity mouse, whereas only 25% of gamers do that. So if I did nothing else but move gamers to wireless, that represents a tremendous growth opportunity for us, especially when I talk about the ASP increases that we have as we move to wireless.</p><p>And then don't forget, you've heard folks like Nvidia, they just had their earnings, they talk about their GPUs are now going into laptops. So there's more and more and more gaming laptops on the market. Well, guess what, I don't know how many of you have tried to play a video game on your laptop, but you can't really move that well with the track pad. So you're going to need a gaming mouse to go with that gaming laptop, well, guess what, you're going to want a wireless mouse with your gaming notebook. You're not going to want a wired product. So this move to wireless is inevitable. It's going to happen, and we're leading the way with our technology advantage.</p><p>So what's next? Well, we're not stopping just on gaming mice, right? So we're going to take that leadership that we have in wireless technology, that LIGHTSPEED that we've invented, and we're going to extend it across the portfolio. So this is our new G915 wireless gaming keyboard that we just introduced the second half of last year. Let's just take a quick look at that.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>UJESH DESAI: Okay. So I'm going to put -- I know it's early morning, but I'm going to put 2 words together in a sentence, they've probably never ever before in the history of the English language been put together in the same sentence, and that is: That is one sexy keyboard. I don't know that anyone has referred to a keyboard as sexy before, but that is really a sexy keyboard, I will say that. And I think part of the reason I think it's so sexy as well is when you look at the results, right, which gets me excited.</p><p>So this keyboard ships in the high-end segment. It's a $180 price point keyboard. A year ago, we had roughly 0% market share in this segment. We launched this keyboard in August of last year. Between August and December, we already have 25-plus percent market share in this segment. So it's proof that this LIGHTSPEED technology that we have, our wireless leadership, we can translate and we can move that across the portfolio.</p><p>So I'm just showing the keyboard and the mouse here. I'm not going to announce any unannounced products, but just stay tuned. We have lots of exciting stuff coming this year and we're going to leverage that wireless leadership across our portfolio. So I'll just leave it at that.</p><p>One other thing, our keyboard, just like gaming mice, actually in keyboard the story is even better for us, if you think about it. The wireless gaming keyboards only have a 3% adoption rate versus Creativity &amp; Productivity is a 53% adoption rate. And guess what, just like wireless gaming mice, within that 3% we have 70% market share, right? So once again, a tremendous growth opportunity, just moving the world to wireless, okay? So stay tuned and we have lots of new exciting announcements coming later this year in the wireless space.</p><p>So next, I want to talk about the racing segment. So those of you that might not know is we've actually been in the steering wheel business for a really long time. We were the first ones to come up with a cable drive force feedback wheel. This is the WingMan Formula 1. We launched this back in 2000. So we have over 20 years of being in the steering wheel space.</p><p>Now the thing that's unique about this space is there's not much competition. It's a very small segment. It's fundamentally us and one other major player. The products that we have today, we have our G29, which is our racing wheel for PlayStation, and we have our G920, which is our racing wheel for the Xbox, right?</p><p>The other thing that we're seeing, which is really unique to this segment unlike other video games that you might play, we're seeing this as a virtual sport where people are making that transition from the virtual world to the real world. In fact, here in the United States, William Byron, he drives, Jeff Gordon's, car for NASCAR, well, guess what, one of the ways he taught himself to drive when he was a young kid is using iRacing and a Logitech racing wheel.</p><p>So we're seeing this transition from the digital world to the real world. In fact, this picture here is from McLaren's headquarters. So we created a partnership with folks like McLaren and folks like Fernando Alonso, who's an F1 racer, and we've created our own eRacing platform. We call it the G Challenge. And by partnering with these folks in the traditional motor sports segment, one of the cool things we've done with the G Challenge is, last year, the winner of G Challenge, guess what the grand prize was? They got hired by McLaren for 1 year and they got to work as a sim racer for McLaren. Talk about changing someone's life. Let me show you a quick video in terms of G challenge and what we're doing.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>UJESH DESAI: So how does G Challenge work? So G Challenge, we launched it last year in May. We kicked it off at the Indy 500. We then ran it during the entire year. We had in-real-life tournaments as well as online tournaments, and it culminated in a grand final in Las Vegas.</p><p>These were some images from the in-real-life event that we did. So we did them in retail centers, in malls. We did it at our gaming event. The really cool thing about this, it was a way to bring this community together. No one was really bringing the racing community together, and by creating G Challenge, we've now given them a platform on which they can come together and share their passion.</p><p>The other beauty of this is a lot of people play racing games but they maybe have never tried a racing wheel in their entire life. By having these in-real-life events, they could come to the stores. They can try the racing wheel, and guess what, they became such a fan, we just sold another racing wheel right there. So that's another benefit of doing this.</p><p>The last thing I'll say is the thing I love personally the most about eRacing and simulation and what we're doing here is it's cross-gender. It's cross-generational. This image that you see here in the top right, that's Josef Newgarden, he's a professional INDYCAR driver. On the bottom right, that's Jamie Chadwick, she's a professional racecar driver, right? So cross-gender.</p><p>Up on the top left there, those are some of the finalists that were part of our G Challenge that we flew out Vegas. I don't know if you could see here, but it's cross-generational, everything from young kids to grandparents. Driving racing is something that all of us can do. We just love to drive. So it's easy to learn, but it's actually fun to figure out how to master. And once again, all the work that we're doing here with G Challenge by building this platform for racing supports our sales as well. Let me get to that in a second.</p><p>But the final live event that we did, just to show you what kind of platform that we're building, this year, for the first time, we decided let's try and stream it. Because it is an eSport, let's stream it ourselves on Twitch. So for the grand finals, we had 158,000 unique viewers that watched over 1.8 million minutes. So for our first time ever streaming this, it was pretty good, pretty impressive, and I think we're just going to grow from here.</p><p>Speaking of growth, this is where it comes down to the numbers themselves. So that G29 racing wheel that I showed you and the G920 in the beginning, those racing wheels, we've been shipping for 4 years now. Yes, because of the launch of G Challenge in 2018, and then we did it again in 2019 and made it even bigger, it's driving double-digit growth for us even though those products are 4 years old. Because we're showing newer gamers that are getting into racing the benefit of having a racing wheel.</p><p>And by the way, the other thing I'm not showing here that we haven't even frankly modeled yet, but we are going to look at that in the future, is because it's our own eSports, and it's our own eRacing platform, well, guess what, we're not even showing the potential revenue we can make here in sponsorships and advertising. So stay tuned there as well.</p><p>So kind of in conclusion, there's 2 main areas for this year that we're driving around PC gaming and simulation. One is wireless. We're going to take that leadership that we have in wireless mice and we're going to extend it across the entire portfolio. And the second is racing. We're going to take the racing wheels that we have, but build a real eSports racing platform, because of what Bracken talked about here and the importance of eSports.</p><p>But I think the more important thing for you to understand here is that this isn't just a one and done. This is a formula that we're operationalizing not only across gaming, but as Delphine mentioned, across the entire company. This idea of innovating to make sure we have a technology lead is the first thing we're doing. But then we combine that with building a real pool platform, demand generation marketing platform, and that's something we'll be able to replicate this year in 2021. But also for our long-term growth opportunities in PC gaming, as the next-gen consoles launch, and obviously, as we go to cloud as well, all right?</p><p>So with that, thank you. That was my presentation. And now I'm going to invite Scott Wharton to come up and talk about the VC space.</p><p>SCOTT WHARTON, GENERAL MANAGER OF VIDEO COLLABORATION GROUP, LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL S.A.: Okay. Thank you, Josh. So I'm going to start out with some disappointing news. Unlike my colleagues, who have some really exciting video, sadly, I don't have any videos to show today. But hopefully, you'll still find the Video Collaboration story pretty exciting. So I'm going to go over 3 things today: one is I'm going to review where we've been over the past year or so; I'm going to go share with you some market trends; and then finally, I'm going to say, what's next? What are we going to do beyond that.</p><p>So let's start out with a review. So over the last couple of years, I think many of you know that we've started out with some real strength in the huddle room; or in the small room space, we launched this product called MeetUp, which has become the industry standard for small rooms. And at the last AID, we said that we were going to expand beyond the small rooms into medium and large rooms.</p><p>So we've successfully done that over the last year, and now we can serve not only small rooms, but medium rooms, all the way up to large boardrooms. And we partly did that with a product, which we introduced about a year ago called Rally. And the great news is that not only is MeetUp a successful product, but Rally is now also very successful. In fact, it's won a bunch of design awards, like Bracken said, but it's also our top-selling product in a very short period of time with incredible momentum in the market.</p><p>The second thing we've done is we've moved from selling point solutions. So a camera, stand-alone speakerphones, so really selling an entire room system. So the audio, the video, the compute, the cabling, everything that someone needs for an entire room. And last year, we unveiled that we launched a product called Tap. So basically, it's a touch controller that you can walk into a room, and as the name suggests, you can just tap on the screen and start a meeting, really making video conferencing much, much easier than they have been in the past. Again, similar story. We won a bunch of design awards for our video for that.</p><p>And this has really allowed us to move from a bunch of different piece parts to where we can sell everything for what you need in one box. So the software, the compute, everything, to not only making the product easy to buy -- easy to use, but also easy to buy. So over the last year, we have expanded that to Microsoft, Zoom and Google. And now customers can buy our products all around the world in over 100 countries. And it's an incredible advantage for us, especially when we're dealing with large enterprises, where they really want to be able to buy and transact and get support locally all around the world.</p><p>So the other thing we said is we were going to continue expanding from building that equipment to building out more software and cloud. And one of the things we've done is we've shipped this product called Logitech RightSight. So basically, allowing you to auto-frame the session when you're in a video call. So instead of picking up a remote control and moving it around, it basically looks at the number of people in the room, sees how many people are there and auto-frames, so you don't have to pick up the remote control. So it's an example of using software to not just add features but really take things away, and make things easier for people to use.</p><p>We also, in June, we launched a new often called Logitech Sync. So basically, it allows us to do device management through a cloud service at a very disruptive price, it's free. And we've had tremendous adoption for this offering over the last year. So we announced the beta in June. We launched it for GA in November. And this is what we're showing in the last 3 months. And now we have over 1,200 large enterprises around the world who are actively using Sync. And as you can see from the chart, we're getting exponential growth in the usage and the number of rooms deployed.</p><p>So again, it's just showing, as Bracken said earlier, our move from having equipment to software to cloud and cloud services, and eventually, today, this is a free service but we'll be able to add premium services that will be added to Sync.</p><p>And as a result, I think what we've done is we've continued to grow in this market. So for the first 3 quarters, we're up 37% year-over-year. And you can see there's just tremendous growth in the VC business, largely organic. In this business, from about $62 million when I started to now on a run rate of about $350 million, almost 6x in the last 5 years.</p><p>So that's kind of looking back a little bit. Now I want to share with you a few trends that are happening in the market. So many of you probably are aware if you're following Zoom or if you're following Logitech, or maybe you're actually using Zoom, and you can see that Zoom is having tremendous growth, which is really helping us and that Zoom is an underlying platform that drives our growth.</p><p>So when Zoom deploys their service, we attach our hardware to Zoom service. In fact, we are the largest hardware partner today with Zoom. So as they are successful as a platform, we benefit from that success and attaching as a platform to Zoom. And they're growing about 85% year-over-year. And a lot of that growth is in the United States, but now they're expanding greatly internationally, and we're following them and working with them across the world to expand on video.</p><p>And then another partnership that we've had for a longer time is with Microsoft. So Microsoft is a world leader in video conferencing. They are very widely deployed by Skype for Business. And what this is showing you is their growth in Teams. So what Microsoft will tell you is that Teams is the fastest-growing application for Microsoft in their history. So for Microsoft, that's saying a lot because they've had a lot of small successes like PowerPoint and a few other applications that many of you might use.</p><p>And what they're showing is they have about 20 million users that was as of November. But I think what we've heard is that the growth continues to go up. And this is also benefiting us as Microsoft succeeds, we're succeeding along with them. And similar to Zoom, we are the largest video conferencing equipment provider that works along with Microsoft.</p><p>I'm going to show you 3 market research slides. These come from a company called Synergy Research. I would say that they're directionally accurate as far as the market research goes. So in this slide, what we're showing is the overall video conferencing equipment. So that would include not only the new equipment in this USB category they're playing in, but also includes all the legacy equipment that's being sold worldwide.</p><p>And you can see that we're now #2 worldwide. So we're bigger than Poly. In fact, we're now -- in the last quarter we're probably closer to 17% of the market for video. But you can see that #1, Cisco, is still by far the biggest player. And part of why we're showing this is, is that we're proud of the progress that we've made. We've gone from about 5% to 15% or 16% in the last 3 years. But I think it also shows how much more we have to go in terms of the ability to win market share away from the competition.</p><p>So the second chart shows not just in revenue but it shows in units, so how many video conferencing rooms are actually deployed worldwide. So you can see that we have 42% of all conference rooms now worldwide in calendar year '19 are deployed on Logitech. That means from an experience point of view, nearly almost 1 out of 2 conference rooms worldwide people are experiencing Logitech now with Zoom, Microsoft, Google and a long tail of other players.</p><p>And then, last but not least, if you take the legacy business out, so all of the old codecs and you just look at the new markets, so these are really products that are attaching to the cloud services like Microsoft, Google, Zoom, et cetera, you can see we've got 62% market share. So almost $2 out of every $3 in this new market are spent on Logitech. Now we're really proud of it, but as I was talking about Bracken last night and the others, this is a snapshot in time. And really what we're -- what we'd like to see is how do we keep this going and how do we grow the market much bigger than where we are today.</p><p>So 3 other examples of what's happening in the market. So there was a trade show a couple of weeks ago in Europe, the biggest trade share for AV, and we announced 3 big partnerships. So I want to spend this -- a little bit of time going through each.</p><p>So one partnership we announced is with a company called Barco. Barco is a public company in Belgium. And if you haven't heard of them, they're the worldwide leader in wireless sharing. So they have a product called ClickShare, which is really the standard of where you walk into a conference room and you could share wirelessly your screen. So they've now added a new capability where you can not only share wireless content, but you can also share audio and video conferencing.</p><p>So I was in New York a few weeks ago with Barco, and we were really the main partner that they announced that they're working with now on video conferencing. And the benefit for us is not just the product integration, but also Barco has a global sales force and a brand and a channel. So it's now another partner that can work with us that will be selling our solutions alongside of our sales force.</p><p>So a second partnership I want to highlight is the company called Crestron. If you haven't heard of them, they're the worldwide leader in AV equipment. If you would walk around the corner, you would see a room in here that's got a huge rack of very expensive, sophisticated Crestron gear. Part of what's exciting about this relationship is that Crestron has been a competitor of ours. So they have their own video conferencing gear. But what they decide to do is partner with us. So we would focus on promoting their high-end gear that's sitting in the racks next door. And in return, they would sell products like MeetUp and Rally to their large enterprise customers and channels.</p><p>Now I think this is a really big deal in that Crestron has got an incredible foothold into the AV world. Some people make their careers based on being trained on Crestron. So again, it's another -- not only a validation for us, but it's also another global brand and sales force that's helping sell our equipment worldwide.</p><p>And then last, but not least, at the same time, we made an announcement with Lenovo. So we're working with Lenovo, not only in expanding our choices for PCs, but Lenovo has decided to also resell our equipment. So it's yet another example of a company that has been competing with us that's also decided, based on the power of our products and brands, to partner with us and help promote our products to their large enterprise customers worldwide. And just to show you how powerful Lenovo is, 1 out of every 3 PCs sold worldwide to the enterprise is sold by Lenovo. They're a huge powerhouse, and we think this is also going to add to our ability to penetrate the enterprise market.</p><p>So that kind of finishes some of the things happening on the market side. So let me tell you a little bit about what's coming up next. So one of the things that we're continuing to go after is this vision of putting video collaboration in every single conference room. We fundamentally believe, as Bracken said earlier, that there is a trend happening in the world, where we're moving from using audio-only calls to video. I think it sounds obvious to most of you. But over time, we expect -- and I don't know how long that time is. Is it 5 years? Is it 10? Is it 20? It's just inevitable that we're going to move the way we work from using audio to using video.</p><p>And if you look at the opportunity we have in front of us, it's massive. So even though probably for some of you, if you live in New York or California, Silicon Valley and maybe were using video on a day-to-day basis, but the reality is there's only about -- between 3% and 5% of all conference rooms that have video in them. So that means we have 95% to 97% that's still upside. As Bracken said, it's almost 20x opportunity, or I guess it's more like 30x, opportunity to grow this market.</p><p>So even though we have that 62% of the market that I showed earlier, we're really just getting started with the opportunity to penetrate video. And I think all of us know this is inevitable. So the question is just how -- who's going to capture that and how?</p><p>Which leads to the next question I'm sure many of you are asking. So, great. Scott, you guys have done really well. You've executed. You've gone 6x, 7x over the last few years, but can you keep it going? Great. The market is there, but how are you guys going to participate in that upside? So let me share with you some thoughts on that.</p><p>So as Bracken said, we started earlier on that wasn't too long ago, where really we were a webcam company and we developed an incredible competency in doing video. So we've shipped over 100 million webcams that were integrated in with Microsoft and Skype. So I think that gave us rights to say that we have -- we know how to do video pretty well. But today, it's more than just about video. So we're developing a bunch of competencies and differentiators that will both expand that and make it harder to compete.</p><p>So one thing that we talked about 2 years ago at AID, we talked about this idea of building up a sales force as a competitive advantage. So basically, what this slide shows is that if you're a startup, you might be able to have some new products but you probably don't have that many salespeople worldwide because it takes, as you guys know, it takes a long time to build up a global sales force.</p><p>And on the other side, yes, there are some very large technology companies that have a massive sales force, but they're selling everything and they're not necessarily focused on our space. So the advantage that we have is we're kind of in the middle. We've got this Goldilocks advantage of being just the right size. So a fairly large sales force, but as Bracken said, we can do more, and totally focused on selling VC and understanding our enterprise customers' needs.</p><p>So part of what we've been doing over the last few years is really going beyond just video and a sales force through a whole bunch of differentiators. So let's start out talking on the product and technology side. So we said that we have a competency in video. But we've also, over the last 5 years, we've been getting really strong in audio. And I think many of you know that if you're in a video call and your audio is not working, then you're not really having that video call, you're switching back to the telephone.</p><p>So we've developed all of the audio technology in-house. We own that IP. So that's an important part of where we've gone from being a video company to an audio company. I've showed you how we have built out our portfolio. So it's not just having one room in the huddle room, and there are some people now entering in just a small room, if you're going to win in the enterprise, you need to have small, medium and large. You really need to have the whole thing. You can't just come in with one product. And we've done that now. As I said, we can sell everything up from the small rooms up into the biggest boardrooms.</p><p>We also have desktop capabilities, too. So as we work with IT managers and buyers and they're buying Zoom, Microsoft and Google, we can help them not only in the conference room, but we can handle their needs for headsets and webcams. So basically, everything they need is probably the largest and broadest portfolio from the desktop to the conference room. And then I showed you some examples on the software side, building out our AIML for audio and video, computer vision and also device management.</p><p>So the point is, I think if you want to play in this space, you can't just come in with a new camera, you really have to have all these things. You have to have a broad portfolio and you have to have them across the world. Otherwise, you can't play. So that's on the product and technology side, but there are other advantages that we've really cultivated and developed over the last few years. And a lot of them have to do with scale and scaling up the business.</p><p>So Bracken and Prakash talked a little bit about our manufacturing capability. This is, I think, a really unsung advantage that we can really build and design products that are in our own factory where we can do them without sharing with other people, and really have the ability to tailor that manufacturing to our needs. So most of the VC products are today built in our own manufacturing facility, and I think this is a big advantage that our competitors don't have, where they largely outsource the capability.</p><p>We also have a very wide distribution. So the ability to go to almost any country in the world is a huge advantage for us. Again, when you're serving a large enterprise, they want to make sure that you can serve them and support them almost everywhere they do business, and we can do that today, which very few people can do. Talk about the sales force. And Ehrika Gladden, my new partner in crime, is going to talk about that a little more when she comes up.</p><p>We also have very deep partnerships with the cloud providers. So whether it's Microsoft, Zoom, Google or literally we have 70 partners around the world, the advantage for us is that they're also selling our solutions for us. So it's not just what we do with our own sales force, but it's our partnerships promoting us, too. As you can imagine, most of these big partners they can't work with 20 partners. Probably can't even work with 10. They're only going to work with a handful for a go-to-market point of view. So this is a big competitive advantage for us.</p><p>And now increasingly, we have a big installed base. So what that means is -- I was talking earlier this morning. If you're an enterprise customer and make a decision to go with your products, they're not like our consumer product switching every 3 months, I mean, you're going to be in there for a while unless you mess up, which hopefully we won't. But usually, the switching times are a lot longer. So part of that advantage is we can grow that installed base, but we can also upsell and cross-sell them other products that we have, not only in the VC space but also with Delphine's products as well.</p><p>And then last but not least, there also is this idea of brands and culture. So one of the nice things about working for Logitech on the VC side is that we can really go into any CIO in the world and they will take a meeting with us because they trust and respect our brand. That is a huge advantage that we have. That as someone who worked at a lot of startups in the past, I can tell you that, that is not something that you take for granted. Whereas as a startup, you try to get a meeting with them and they go, \"Who are you and why am I going to meet with you? Can I trust you?\" It's not an issue with Logitech.</p><p>Another advantage we have is we have incredible price performance. Again, the discussion I had this morning, they're saying what's the difference between what we do and some of the players that are trying to enter this market. Well, we are incredibly good at building products at a high volume and a low price. And I think many of you know that some companies are good at building different attributes, very high price, low volume, we're really good at the opposite. So I would say, the market is really moving our way, where people want to have great products at a reasonable price.</p><p>And then last but related to it, we've got a pretty clean business model. So what I mean by that is we're not trying to evolve from selling very, very expensive products with extensive salespeople and move down market. I think many of you know, if you're a financial analyst, that it's easier said than done to be able to change your business model. You can launch new products, but can you change your distribution, your culture, your sales compensation? And I think a lot of our competitors are certainly trying to move to the direction that we are. But I think you all know that that's easier said than done.</p><p>So a couple of more thoughts on this. So one is, if you're a startup, sure, you may be able to launch a new product and have some technology, but it's really hard to do all these advantages of scale to get global distribution and a sales force. If you are a big tech company, yes, you may have some advantage of scale. But I think what I mentioned is the requirements to compete in the space, you not only just need one product but you need this broad portfolio and IP and technology. So the barrier to competing here is really going are pretty high.</p><p>And then last but not least, if you're a competitor that's been in this space for a long time, sure you can try to shift your business model, but I think everybody here knows that you can change technology, but people are -- people and culture are harder to change. So while I would say that any one of these attributes is probably not that -- not defensible in and of itself, when you combine all these things together, I think we're building a pretty robust story about how we compete and how we add value to customers around the world.</p><p>So I'm just going to end on the note by saying that we've -- it's -- I've been at Logitech now for about 4.5 years and I think it's been a really exciting ride. And we've made incredible progress. But at the same time, I think I would say that I'm -- I've never been more excited about the position that we're in, the opportunity to both transform this business, but transform the world and how we all communicate and how we need to communicate.</p><p>So with that, I will introduce my transformation partner, Ehrika. Thanks very much.</p><p>EHRIKA GLADDEN, HEAD OF GLOBAL VIDEO COLLABORATION OF SALES &amp; MARKETING, LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL S.A.: Thanks, Scott. Thanks a lot. Nice to meet you all. I'm Ehrika Gladden. And as a 30-year -- but not quite 3 decades, I'm rounding up a bit. You can laugh because I need it. I'm super excited about the opportunity to enter enterprises with the consumer brand, as Scott just spoke to.</p><p>Imagine entering an IT department, full of consumers; marketing departments, full of consumers; human resource departments, all of whom need to innovate, connect, collaborate with this technology.</p><p>So my background is early '90s, start-ups from the spin-in/spinout era of AT&amp;T, Lucent and Avaya leading P&amp;L operations. The technologies that I've supported over my career are telephony services, cloud, X-as-a-service as well as networking, including Cisco Systems.</p><p>Bracken asked me today to do my 30-day review because that's how long I've been here, 4 weeks and 2 days, in public. You ready? All right. Scott just talked about it. The brand is incredible. The culture, infectious. Portfolio, innovative. But I'm a true speaker. So let's talk about the piece that I get to focus on, and that's the operational discipline required to meet customers where they are.</p><p>Today, we sell mice and keyboards as well as video collaboration, and webcams and headsets to the same buyer with no certain priority. Customers who are both global, mid-market and in every economy I enter, the small -- I call them foundational, they're foundational to every economy. Those customers have to be met based on what their interests are. If you're talking to a Fortune 1000 global customers, their interest is in globalization, the war for talent, how this technology can help them address sustainability, as Prakash just spoke to.</p><p>But a mid-market client or a foundational customer has a completely different interest. Today, we meet them all the same. Imagine segmentation with targeting, and what that focus will create in terms of capturing the opportunity that Scott just spoke to.</p><p>Last but not least, the channel, my friends across the channel that I've cultivated over the years are all calling. They're very excited about this opportunity. But they know how to scale, whether it's a cloud provider, a direct market reseller, service providers, they know how to scale and enter the market. Today, this is an opportunity for us to be much more sophisticated.</p><p>So the point is, Scott shared with you the accelerated focus that he and the team have taken over the last 5 years. Operational discipline will create the focus that allows us to capture that next set of opportunities.</p><p>So I'm looking forward to staying in touch with you all and keeping you posted on that progress beyond 30 days, Bracken. All right. Thanks.</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD, CFO &amp; PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER, LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL S.A.: Thanks, Ehrika. All right, everyone. Well, Scott didn't get his video, but thanks to my friend, Ujesh, who put together a quick video here. I haven't seen it before, but I'm excited to check it out. So if we can just go ahead and roll the finance video. Go ahead and roll it.</p><p>All right, Ujesh. We'll talk about budgets later, I guess. All right, never mind. No video for finance, but I do have the numbers. So let me jump right in.</p><p>I'm going to talk about the FY '21 outlook in a little bit. But I think what's really important -- maybe if I quickly just kind of summarize what you've heard today. Because I think what's so important for you to walk away with here is the long-term potential and opportunity that we have here at Logitech, not just for next year, but really out over multiple years. And Bracken introduced this early on, and you've heard from each of the business group leaders, about the potential. So in Creativity &amp; Productivity, becoming a $1.5 billion greater revenue business. Video Collaboration and Gaming both have the potential to be more than $1 billion in annual sales.</p><p>And if you think about where they are today, that would be adding -- if they all get there over the next 3 to 5 years, we'd be adding more than $1 billion of revenue to Logitech, would be increasing our revenue by more than 33%. So that's pretty exciting. And what I would say is -- and by the way, that's happening at very attractive margins as well. So while we're growing the business, we're expanding our margin rates, we're creating investment capacity to then invest further out into the future as well.</p><p>So before I move on, what I would say, what you really have to walk away with is you have to believe 2 things: one, is that the market potential is big and that there are secular tailwinds that are pushing the market forward; and two, that Logitech, with its history of execution in tough times and in good times, and that our capabilities, our core capabilities in areas of design and innovation, go-to-market and operational excellence -- we've got Prakash here who's done a fantastic job, that with our capabilities in those areas we can go capture that market opportunity. So those are really the 2 things I want you to keep in mind above and beyond anything else.</p><p>So one thing I want to share with you here is a little bit about how we think about investing here at Logitech. And I'm going to walk through this model kind of briefly. But what's really important for you to walk away with is an understanding that we have a very rigorous and disciplined, thoughtful and consistent way of thinking about our portfolio investments across the company.</p><p>And again, I'll touch it at kind of a high level. But if you think about our broad portfolio, we're creating experiences for customers along the x-axis here, and we're trying to address existing and new users along the y-axis. And so we think about our investments fitting in these different categories, and you've got products here on display that demonstrate some of these. So we have sort of sustain investments, which is refreshing an existing product lines, some of these might just be a color change. We might do a special color for the holiday, that would be an example of a sustain product refresh.</p><p>Now evolve and transform. Evolve would be more what you hear us talking about here today. These are improvements on existing products, where we're addressing new users or maybe expanding the experiences for our existing users. And you'll see examples of that, Delphine mentioned a few, the Pebble mouse is a good example or some of the ergonomic products that her team has developed are really helping us expand to either new users or new experiences for existing users.</p><p>And then our transform investments, our innovation investments into transform technologies, these are things that are really addressing completely new users and completely new experiences. And some good examples of that were the StreamCam, which you see back here that Delphine had in her presentation with -- I'm looking on this screen back here, but with Ms. Margarita, the makeup artist. As well as in Prakash's presentation with POWERPLAY that really cool charge mat for the wireless mouse. Those are great examples of some of our transform investments and innovation.</p><p>So again, the important thing -- most companies have some sort of framework. I think ours is quite good. It's simple. It helps provide discipline and focus and faster decision-making for us in the company, and really a consistent way for us to look at our investments across our portfolio.</p><p>Now I mentioned the broad portfolio, and you've heard -- if you followed us, we talk about this a lot because I do think it is really important to our success, is the diversification that we have. And you often hear or think about our diversification by category. And if you -- in my job, what I'm really trying to do is provide investments that can sustain over the long term. So as I work with the business leaders, I want to provide as much predictability as I can to their investments so that they can build a long-term road map.</p><p>And that's much easier for me to do when we have this type of diversification, because we're not reliant on any single category to drive our results in any given year. So if one category is soft in any particular year, we have the strength of the diversified portfolio that allows us to sustain investments and maintain our long-term road maps.</p><p>And I think that's a tremendous competitive advantage against just a pure-play or a single-category competitor who, if they face that tough year, I'll tell you, their CFO has a very tough job. Their CEO and CFO and business team has a tough job deciding what to do. Because they can't meet their commitment externally if they continue to invest. But at the same time, if they don't continue to invest, they're going to fall behind to a company like Logitech that can maintain those investments. So it's a huge competitive advantage for us and it's one of the reasons why I believe we're able to, year in and year out, meet our commitments and deliver on our long-term potential.</p><p>We also have diversification by geography or by country, and I think this tough environment we're in right now, obviously, with the coronavirus, actually highlights one example of this. China is our second largest country, it makes up about 10% of our sales. And while we did modestly adjust our operating profit outlook for this year, we've been able to continue plowing ahead, pushing forward with our strategies despite the fact that, obviously, there's been such disruption and difficulties in that one large country for us, but we're diversified around the world and really global.</p><p>The other type of diversification, I want to highlight for you, which you just heard about when Scott and Ehrika presented was kind of our diversification across customers and the investments we're making to become a more diversified company, not only in consumer but even more broadly now into the enterprise with that wonderful portfolio that Scott is -- Scott and his team have been producing, and now that Ehrika is going to come in and help us take to market. So this diversification across category, geographies and now even further with customers really important to Logitech.</p><p>So if I think about how those attributes play out and what does it mean for us financially, I mean, I think this is a slide any CFO would love to present. If you look over the last 3 years, and this includes our updated estimates for FY '20, 10% revenue CAGR, actually above the long-term model that we've laid out. You can see the gross margin expansion there in the center on the top, despite significant tariff and currency headwinds that you saw on Bracken's presentation, we've managed to maintain the forward progress on our gross margins. Expanding those over the last 3 years.</p><p>And then costs down in the bottom here in the center. OpEx as a percentage of sales, you can see, we've taken out about 100 basis points of cost, all that coming out of G&amp;A. We've actually been investing at or above the rate of revenue growth in our R&amp;D and sales and marketing over this period. So we've been reducing our costs as a percentage of revenue in G&amp;A and reinvesting that back into the business.</p><p>And of course, if you sum those together, you get the nice right-hand side of this chart, which is the operating profit. A CAGR of 14% faster than revenue growth, which, of course, means our operating margins have expanded. You can see estimate is more than 1 point as we close out this year compared to where we were 3 years ago. So really robust financial performance based on many of the attributes I mentioned earlier.</p><p>Now of course, the starting point for free cash flow generation, which is, ultimately, what I care most about is how much are we generating consistent free cash flow to reinvest back into the business and return to shareholders. Of course, that starts with strong operating profit growth. So you can see here our free cash flow generation over time. And what's so exciting here, if you look at FY '20, that's year-to-date. That's just through the first 3 quarters of the year, it does not include any forecast for Q4.</p><p>And our cash flow year-to-date is already nicely above where it was last year and almost a record for a full year, which was back here in FY '18, just through the first 3 quarters of the year. So a strong operating profit growth and a real focus on working capital efficiency is generating good success here on free cash flow, which, of course, we consistently plow back into the business through M&amp;A or return to shareholders through dividends, which we've been growing at about 10% per year for the last few years and share buybacks.</p><p>Okay. Now let's cover the financial outlook for FY '21. So you can see here on the top line, sales growth taking into account, what we see today from a macro environment. Certainly, it's an interesting time to be providing an outlook for the full year. But again, I think you know Logitech. I think you know our history of execution and our determination to achieve these numbers. Mid-single-digit top line growth in constant currency, I'll talk to some of the assumptions around that in just a second. And then on the operating profit line, $380 million to $400 million of operating profit for fiscal year '21.</p><p>Obviously, coronavirus is a very fluid situation. The assumptions that we've built in here, as Bracken mentioned earlier, I think, certainly we had some supply challenges in Q4 and some demand challenges, particularly in China in Q4. I think the supply situation is improving. And I think -- again, I think our team out-executes the competition in regards to many of these things.</p><p>The supply challenges are improving, but we see those really persisting a bit into Q1. And so we're going to see some revenue and profit pressure in Q1 relative to our normal performance in that quarter. Positively, we are expecting to see normalized supply conditions starting in Q2. Now from a demand perspective, it's obviously a little harder to predict. But for supply, which we have pretty good visibility to, that's our expectation in this outlook.</p><p>In terms of tariffs, which was obviously a huge topic this current fiscal year in FY '20, we're assuming no change to the current tariff rates. So if List 3 comes down at some point, that's not factored in here. We're assuming tariff rates are exactly where they are. Currency, we're assuming the average rates for FY '20. The only other change I'd call out here, just for modeling purposes, is our tax rate. We've mentioned throughout this year and posted in our filings, we're expecting a gradual increase in our tax rate of about 0.5 point, maybe 1 point each year for maybe the next decade, but starting to see that here show up in FY '21 due to some changes in the Swiss tax laws.</p><p>Looking at growth expectations by category, Creativity &amp; Productivity, similar to last year. I'm guiding or expecting low single-digit growth. Certainly, Delphine has a great vision for her business and she's been doing a little bit better than the expectation I've been setting. But I think this is the right way to think about the business and the right way for us to align our resources as we get started in the year.</p><p>Video Collaboration, once again, we're projecting a growth rate of 25% to 30%. Again, Scott and Ehrika are developing plans to perhaps do better. But we got to also keep in mind the law of large numbers here, and I think this is the right way to think about Video Collaboration as we get started on the year. Gaming with Ujesh, 10% to 15% growth. So we've got 2 nice double-digit scale businesses -- double-digit growth businesses here with Video Collaboration and Gaming.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind for Gaming. This is a console refresh year. So this coming holiday, Sony and Microsoft will be refreshing their consoles. Typically, we see a bit of a slowdown on console peripherals, so like our ASTRO headsets, going into a console refresh. So we'll see how that plays out. But we've factored that into our outlook for next year. But that's one thing to keep in mind as you're doing your modeling for Gaming.</p><p>Music, the largest category within the music space for us is our Bluetooth speakers. We have seen some slowing in that market, really for the past couple of years. So I'm projecting this to be flat to down 10%. We'll have some other businesses in there, such as Blue Microphones that obviously, I think, will do a little better than that. But Bluetooth speakers is really our largest portion. And then similar to last year, Smart Home, from a modeling standpoint this remains too small to really matter from a modeling standpoint.</p><p>So closing out, as I mentioned coming in, I think the FY '21 is obviously very important, our ability to manage through what looks to be kind of a tough situation, obviously, with the virus. But it's really that long-term financial outlook, long-term financial strategy, which I think is so important. And this hasn't changed from last year. We continue to drive our portfolio and our businesses for high single-digit growth.</p><p>We continue to believe that we'll have gross margins within the 36% to 40% range. We're currently, as you saw earlier, at about 38%, so still some room to grow there. I would say, similar to the past, if I see opportunities to drive the top line and to drive growth at positive with -- profitably, we may make trade-offs and do that. So while we've incurred a lot of gross profit headwinds this year, if some of those are released, [all our] tariffs and so forth, I wouldn't immediately expect to see gross margin shoot up to 40% because we may see opportunities to reinvest that back into revenue and to really drive the long-term performance.</p><p>We'll continue to, as Bracken mentioned, I think, really explore and, importantly, develop recurring and higher-margin revenue streams organically and inorganically. And we'll continue to maintain our very disciplined capital allocation priorities across M&amp;A, dividends and share buyback.</p><p>That's what I have for you today financially. Bracken, if you want to come on up.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Sure. Thank you, Nate. Actually -- very nicely done. This is Nate's first Analyst and Investor Day, man, he seems like an old pro.</p><p>I just -- I have a couple of things to finish on. One is, I got a question before we started today, which I didn't answer because the appropriate place to answer that, the correct place to answer that, is in public. And the question I got was, I asked someone here, what did you think of our guidance this year and next year? And the person said -- and the person shall remain nameless, said, \"I was probably smart to take your guidance down this year. Whether it's because the business is softening or it's because of the coronavirus, it's kind of all muddled together and nobody will know the difference.\"</p><p>Well, I want to tell you right now, our demand is super strong, exactly where we thought it would be. The reduction we took this year is completely because of supply and because of the demand impact in China and a few places where we simply couldn't supply. So the business continues to be strong. And I feel really, really excited about it.</p><p>Now going into next year, our assumption is it's continue to be pretty solid, some kind of a band. We expect to have -- we don't expect to see a big change in the demand curve. If a big change happens, then of course we'd have to revisit our numbers. But I don't expect that to happen. But in some kind of a band, I think you can expect that from strong to weaker, we can deliver the guidance we had for next year or we wouldn't be giving it.</p><p>The second thing I wanted to talk about briefly was what happens from our risk -- for those of you who've been -- talked to -- who've been to these things before, I kind of live in 2 worlds. On the one hand, I'm super growth-oriented, always. 100% of the time -- ambitious, optimistic, can do, don't let it get in our way. On the other hand, I huddle and I live in fear of the worst case. But I'm always nervous about what could happen. So I live in this dark place, like 5% of my time, thinking, \"Oh, my god, what if?\" So you've got the growth Bracken and the risk management Darrell.</p><p>And the risk management Darrell comes out when I think about recessions and when bad things could happen. Global recession, fears of a global recession, what happens if this thing gets terrible and worse. And who knows exactly. I mean you can't predict the entire impact of anything when you get to that level. But if I ground myself back in our business and I'll go back to the reality of what we do for a living, here's what I think.</p><p>First, I think if we end up being quarantined in our homes, and we need to spend more time at home and people are encouraged not to cumulate to work together, you're probably going to want to have your own workspace at home. So you'll continue to have your workspace at work, but you'll also have your workspace at home. If you have a workspace at home, you're going to want to have something at home that's good. And that's great for Delphine's business.</p><p>If you're at home more, it's probably not going to stop this from happening. People are going to continue to want to game, so they'll keep gaming. And that probably speaks well for Ujesh's business. And the reality is, if we're doing more and more remote work, we're going to do more and more video connecting. If you're doing more and more video connecting, an amazing, affordable solution is the way to go.</p><p>So if I look across all 3 of our businesses and I put myself in that dark place, that I don't think will happen tomorrow or 6 months from now but could, I actually think, gosh, I'd rather be here than anywhere. So I think we're a great investment for growth and we're a great investment for risk management. That's just my point of view, and I'm obviously extremely biased.</p><p>The final thing I want to close on is -- and then we'll take questions, anybody here can take questions, is a few big questions that we already answered, but I want to remind you what the answers are.</p><p>The first one is, in Delphine's business, our oldest, most mature, most boring business -- Delphine, I didn't mean to offend you, I was being sarcastic. Our Creativity &amp; Productivity business is not only alive and well but it has exciting growth potential, driven mostly from the youngest users out there. Those who are going out every day and digitally creating things to put out for their friends, for their followers and for the potential new business customers that they're trying to create. It's a super, super exciting business. If that were our only business, it would be a great company. So do I think that our best days are -- and we're kind of not going to be able to grow, no way. We are going to keep growing, sustainably growing in our C&amp;P business, our biggest business. If you aggregate categories.</p><p>Gaming. Do I think that growth is slowing in Gaming? Do I think that this trend is going to somehow change? No. I hope you got a little feel for Ujesh's enthusiasm for the business, and he lives in the middle of it. If you've got kids, you know this. This trend line is not going to change. The growth of Gaming is just on a secular growth curve that will not let up. That is the future. There will still be regular sports, thank god. I'm a basketball player, an old one, but I'm a basketball player. But the growth of gaming is going to continue unabated. And we're going to keep entering new spaces around it and driving our growth in things like Streamlabs. So look, get ready, it's not going to slow down. We're going to keep growing. Now you hit the law of big numbers, so it won't grow maybe 25% every year, but I think the 10% to 15% is very reasonable.</p><p>And the last one is Video. Oh my god, what happens when -- now that it's gotten really attractive, what happens when the competitors come? We must be in trouble. This must be the end. The glory days are over. Well, the competitors have been there, they're going to be there and they're going to get stronger. And we've been there and we're getting stronger and stronger and stronger. And every step we take is to make ourselves a more efficient, more effective and more aggressive competitor. So we love competition. Without competition, you don't improve enough. So if we have more competitors and the competitors that -- were going to get better, terrific. There's so much growth in this market. So much.</p><p>I mean, sometimes, I can't believe the numbers that we put out there, but 3% to 5% of the rooms enabled and that it's probably going to get to -- I don't know where it'll end up. It'll end up -- 10 years from now, maybe it's going to be 70%, 80%. You do the math, that's a lot of growth ahead of us. And we're building an integrated system that is not easy to duplicate. Sometimes it's an advantage to start from scratch, and we started from scratch 8 years ago. And now this thing is getting really sick with tentacles that connect everything, as Scott described it really well. So I'm super excited about the business.</p><p>The last question is, what's next? What's the next growth thing, Bracken? Where are you going to grow next? Well, the answer is we don't need one. We've got exactly what we need. We set the table, now we run that -- now we have dinner. Now we run the play. We run the play for the next several years. But there will be a what's next, because we're always working on what's next. We're always working on new seeds. There's stuff in development in the backroom. Can I tell you what they are or that they're going to come out? I will tell you what they are and I can't tell you if they're going to come out. We'll keep working on them. Because there should always be a what's next, a couple of what's nexts.</p><p>So we'll stop there and give you a chance for questions. Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Yes?</p><p>STEVEN MARK WILSON, FOUNDER, MD, CIO &amp; ANALYST, LAPIDES ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC: Steve Wilson with Lapides Asset Management. This is a great presentation. Obviously, it was skewed towards your larger, faster-growing businesses, but you have a number that are stagnant and a few that are actually declining. Could you just talk about where they fit in all this in terms of is there, for each one of these, a revitalization strategy? Or we're just going to sort of take these body blows and let them sort of wither away?</p><p>And I'll come back to the chart where we talked about Smart Home, and basically what was the outlook and it was like too small to matter. Can you afford to have a couple too smalls to matter and still have them remain and fold? Or do you need to look at this and say only our stronger business need to stay in?</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: I always viewed, from the first day, actually from before I joined and Guerrino and I first talked, I always view Logitech as a, and what would be a, dynamic portfolio company. And my definition of a dynamic portfolio company means you have things you invest and double down in, things you support but don't expect high-growth from and things you take advantage of for their contribution to profit and use to invest to those first 2 things. And so those things that you described that aren't represented in 3 businesses today somehow fit into all 3 of those buckets.</p><p>There are some of those areas that -- we didn't talk too much about Jaybird today, we didn't talk very much about Bluetooth speakers today, we didn't talk about PC speakers today. I think each one of those is in a different state of play. And what's happening in each of those, now I won't go through all of them, but I'll just say you've got some business where we think very deliberately about how do we reduce the overall investment, get it to the lowest level we can and sustain the business, or even sustain the growth -- decline curve and use that to invest where we've got high-growth, like in Scott's business or Ujesh's business or Delphine's business. So I view it as a dynamic portfolio. You ask, can we sustain that? Can we live there? Absolutely. That's by design.</p><p>Now in the Home, we've really pulled back on the Harmony business because we don't think it's got a long-term potential to really be a growth driver for us. It's still there. We still support those customers. They love us, absolutely love us, and they buy a lot of other things from us. So we'll keep supporting them, but we're not going to invest in that business. We're not going to try to make something else. We've done various things to -- tested the water. We're going to keep supporting it, but in a very modest way.</p><p>Okay. Next question, Ananda.</p><p>ANANDA PROSAD BARUAH, MD, LOOP CAPITAL MARKETS LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Can you just -- I have a couple, if I could. But could you just start by commenting on how much of the fiscal '21 guidance is -- or to what extent it's impacted top line, bottom line by coronavirus? And then I have a follow up after that.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Sure. It's a really tough one to answer. You want to try or you want me to do it?</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Yes. So -- and we mentioned in Q4, we had about a $30 million revenue impact. I think Q1 based on what we see right now, I think it could be that size as well, maybe even a little bit worse, maybe a little bit better. We'll see how long it takes for the supply to recover. Again, under the assumption that we get back to kind of full capacity and full supply in Q2, I think most of what we're projecting is going to be a Q1 impact. Obviously, we'll get more visibility to that in the days and weeks ahead.</p><p>I think beyond that, I think Bracken mentioned, it will be interesting to see how some of this plays out just with kind of the use cases for many of our products and how it may be something that people find very attractive for them to help -- as their lives change potentially here, especially in the short term, we can help provide some solutions for them.</p><p>ANANDA PROSAD BARUAH: Is there any cost headwinds from increased shipping costs or anything like that?</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Yes. So I'll talk to that one, too. So that's something that we see a little bit of in Q4. It's part of the profit impact here in Q4, and probably more so in Q1 as we try to catch up. A lot of what we needed in, say, the U.S. for Q4 was on a boat before all this started. So we may have to chase a little bit because demand has been good and spend a little money on airfreight here in Q4, and that's included in our outlook. I think that's one of the things that I probably expect to see be a little bigger factor in Q1. Just as supply starts to catch up, it's going to be late in the quarter, we may need to accelerate and expedite some of that material into the U.S.</p><p>ANANDA PROSAD BARUAH: And then just one last one here. Just with regards to Gaming. The compares are easier, but the console mark -- I mean, this console refresh, so there's some sort of friction there between those 2 dynamics. The Gaming guidance for this year was a little bit lower than the Gaming guidance for '20. Could you just sort of walk us through how -- sort of how you get from easier compares? Well, you get the sort of guidance going -- being lower in fiscal '21 and the interplay between easier compares but console refresh. And if there's anything else that drives the guidance being lower in '21 versus '20 for Gaming...</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Let me address this first.</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Sure. Okay.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Yes. There are really 2 things that drive the -- there's 3 things that drive the Gaming number. So overall, the Gaming -- the secular trend in Gaming continues. And you said -- as you said, you had the top compares last year, the Fortnite effect, they're largely gone. This year, however, you've got another dynamic which is the 2 consoles refreshed. In historical -- historically, when those console refreshes happen, it sort of froze the headset market for a little while. And so we certainly think that could be a dynamic that happens. How severe it is, we don't know. We're contemplating it in our number.</p><p>The second one is that our controller for the controller relaunch this year will go out of -- essentially be out of -- not in spec when those new consoles come on, at least for a while. So we're expecting that to phase out. Do you want to add anything?</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Yes. I mean, I think similar to this year and under the -- we've got several businesses within there. We've talked this year about how the PC gaming businesses have continued to grow nicely in the double digits. In fact, even better than a year before in some quarters. So I think it's going to be a mix of things. I wouldn't say every business within gaming is going to grow in that 10% to 15% range, but I do think that's kind of where the overall gaming portfolio will land.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Got 2 questions, unrelated questions. First one is I want to go back to the commentary on Smart Home. I understand it's too small to matter and that's not a business that you're going to invest in. But when you look at the overall picture of Smart Home, how big that could be, why not try to make that one of a transformative investment? Because it seems like it could be a massive home run for you guys if you did do that.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Yes. Okay. Well, I'll jump in on that. That might be a smart thing to do. We work on a bunch of different seeds in the background, and we're always looking at M&amp;A. And so we're always thinking about what else could we be doing? And if we were doing something else, it'd be in the context of those 2 areas. What we're basically saying is in the businesses that we report publicly right now, which is mostly Harmony, it's not an area where we're really going to be investing in. So that's going to be in a steady decline, I would say; or worst case, flat line.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that we're not interested in the Smart Home. We bring a lot of things to the -- from a technology standpoint, we bring a lot of things into play, from an engineering standpoint and design, that we could do in the Home that are really interesting, but we're just not out there with them yet. Will we come out with something? We'll see. It's too early to say. But right now, based on what you see, that's our view.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: Okay. And then the other question is that I think it's safe to say that you are investing in growth, which always comes at the expense of current operating margins. You guys have been pretty transparent about that. But what I'd like to really get a -- some perspective on is how much investment? Obviously, with your gross margins' 36% to 40% guidance, more or less at the midpoint there, that's just that there might be 200 basis points there. But what about on the OpEx line? Are we talking about 200,000, 500,000 basis points of investment in growth? And therefore, when you get to a mature state, we could be looking at maybe 1,000 basis points higher operating margin x years out, whether that be 3, 5, 10 whatever.</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: So on operating margin, it's part of that long-term outlook, we've set a range of 11% to 14%. We think we'll end this year probably somewhere right in about the middle of that. And I really think about those levers somewhat interchangeably between gross margin and OpEx. Different businesses have different gross margin profiles and different OpEx intensity as well. I think our focus is on adding more high-margin businesses to the portfolio, and we're doing that today in these growth categories. And the good news is, too, I think we've put a lot of investment into the P&amp;L over the last few years, specifically in Video Collaboration, where not only have we've been really expanding the portfolio and the rate of innovation in that category, but also with the sales coverage. So I think we've put some costs in the P&amp;L there that I expect to have a good long-term return.</p><p>The other thing is we've been pulling dollars, we talk about this move from push to pull, if you've heard us talk about that before. And what that is, is increasing our investment in our marketing capability, which again, goes into OpEx but provides that good long-term return. So you don't always see these things from quarter-to-quarter, even on a full year, because there's a lot of moving parts and we're shifting a lot of things around between businesses or categories that have different growth trajectories. But net-net, I would say, we'll continue to focus on tightening the expenses on G&amp;A and always keeping that growing slower than revenue growth, and then investing in R&amp;D and investing in sales and marketing. Sometimes, you may not see those things, like I said, increase necessarily just because we're shifting things around. But we're really trying to realign investments to where we think the business needs the support.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Before you ask a follow-up, let me add something to that, which I agree with 100%. Yes, I think if we didn't think we had long-term strong growth opportunities, we would certainly increase our expectation of operating margins. We -- but we really believe in this upper single-digit growth opportunity, and I think that's going to keep expanding. So that is directly related to that 11% to 14% operating income level. If that changes for some reason, 5 years from now, 10 years from now, I'm sure we would change our outlook. But no way would we expect a 1,000 point increase in operating income levels when we've got so much growth opportunity ahead of us.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: Sure. And I wouldn't expect that either. But let me just push back. You've given some things to think about on how to think about my question ultimately, terminal period margin question, 200,000, 500,000 basis points higher. And based on the inputs that you gave me, I would be thinking probably somewhere in the 200, 400 basis point range above the current guidance range. Is that the right way to think about that?</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Again, I think we'll continue...</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: 11% to 14%, yes?</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Yes. I mean, I think 11% to 14% is the range we have right now, and that's really a long-term view. Like I said, there's many ways to grow cash. I can do it by expanding margins and growing, or I could grow faster on the top line and I can still generate the same cash. So we set ranges because we like to have the optionality and the flexibility to create different types of businesses and pursue different types of opportunities. So I guess I don't focus necessarily just on the operating margin number, I'm really focused on operating profit growth and free cash flow growth, and we'll get there whichever way makes sense.</p><p>BEN LU: And I'll give you a second. We actually had a couple of folks email me some questions, so I'm going to ask on their behalf.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Those are family members or...</p><p>BEN LU: So one of the analysts have asked, Bracken, you talked about a slide or pointed to a slide where we talked about services. Can you elaborate a little bit about what you mean by that and the time frame?</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Yes. I -- so first of all, we're already moving down the services path. If you look at Gaming, C&amp;P or Video Collaboration, all 3 of them have some kind of a service component already in the business, not to mention Streamlabs, which is an acquisition that's a 100% service. So we're moving systematically down this path. Now today, the amount of service that we do that's not integrated into I buy a product, the service comes for free. And that's true of -- for example, of Delphine's business. But over time, I expect that we'll transition from continuing to do that, to continue to do that and also have some dedicated service businesses.</p><p>So you notice the chart that I showed, whoever asked this question, you'll notice it's got kind of a nice general sort of sloping up curve, that's to tell you don't expect a big service revenue component tomorrow. But over time, you can expect a bigger service revenue component, because we're going to -- we're building it. And we're building a software engineering culture and team across our business to support that. So it's too early to talk much more about it than that, except to say that we're serious, we're investing, we're hiring and its coming.</p><p>BEN LU: All right. And the other question on VC is, do you envision a world where hardware gets embedded into TVs, laptops that obviate or eliminate the need for stand-alone video conferencing equipment that Logitech sells?</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: I think there's going to be a whole bunch of happening between now and 97% rooms enabled. And it's really hard to imagine all the things that will happen. Just like it was -- there was a lot of stuff that had to happen between the time when we created our first mouse in 1981 to 2020 when we have a great business in that business. So I think there's a lot of things happening. We're doing a lot of things in terms of bringing on new things into our portfolio. So whatever scenario I can come up with looks good for us, to me so far. Now 10 years from now, we'll see. I hope this looks a lot like the mouse and keyboard business 30 years from now, I think it might. But no matter what, we have a great opportunity.</p><p>BEN LU: All right. And then the last question is for Nate. Nate, last year, you talk about or you talked about a $3 EPS. Can you talk about whether you still think that's an achievable target?</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Sure. Well, I think it starts with revenue, right? So when I was talking earlier about that long-term growth potential in these 3 large categories we talked about today, if we had a $1 billion of revenue from those businesses, it takes about a little bit less than $2 of operating profit for $0.01 of EPS, okay? So we need $200 million of operating profit increase to drive another $1 of EPS. So on $1 billion of incremental revenue, really the question there is can we flow that through at 20%? Well, our gross margins today are 40%, so I would say, yes, if we can generate -- if you believe that we can generate that extra $1 billion plus of revenue, then you'll see the EPS come with that. Sure.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Ananda?</p><p>ANANDA PROSAD BARUAH: Yes. Just going back to VC, 2 there if I could. The first is, just based on what you guys talked about today, Polycom is having sort of some dynamics. They're having a deal with Cisco, you've had a lot of really solid recent success against as well, even moving into boardroom. What would be the reasons that you wouldn't continue? Or you -- what would be the reasons that the momentum in there would slow for you guys? Like if it were to slow and there were to be competitive response from, let's say, actually from -- well, let's start with Cisco, what would some of those reasons be given that there's such a price point, call it the returns advantage differential, between the 2 of you? Because it's easy to envision why you guys would continue to do well, I'd love to get a sense for why you might not continue to do as well, if there is the possibility that you won't.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Well, there's always a possibility, right? I think it won't come back to what our competitors do, it comes back to what we do. If we don't keep executing our new products, which we fully intend to and will; if we don't execute beautifully on new products as we have so far, and I believe we will; if we don't continue to upgrade the execution capability of our sales force so that we're selling at the level we're capable of and getting the kind of opportunity we're capable of, and I believe we're not nearly what we're capable of today, then we could slow down. But I don't believe this is about a competitive problem, this is about a Logitech opportunity. We either deliver or we don't. And that's exactly where I'd like to sit all the time. And this is a unique spot where there's so much growth opportunity in the market that it's -- the ball is in our court, we just have to execute.</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Yes, I would agree with that. I mean, I think the market is heading towards our strengths. And I think what Bracken is saying there rings true across the company, in fact, because I think the biggest single risk is complacency. I think when you have success, that's the one thing we really got to fight against. And I think the competition actually helps combat that.</p><p>ANANDA PROSAD BARUAH: Cool. And then maybe, Bracken, just a clarification. Let me just to put you on the spot for one of the questions that Ben asked off the web. So just with regards to VC capability potentially becoming ubiquitous on television sets, and then you actually said that you can't imagine -- that you believe that any dynamic that might occur that you could currently imagine as you place your strengths, would that be included in what you can imagine? And if so, how would that play to your strengths?</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: I think at the end of the day, it's not easy to imagine an embedded camera that can do what a non-embedded camera can do in this case depending on the size room you're in. So I doubt seriously if that would suddenly eliminate the need for a separated systems. I mean there's a reason why dedicated systems exist. So yes, I don't think that's -- I'm not -- I don't live in fear of that alternative. I think if that happens, and it could, it's going to signal a world where you're going to have multiple cameras operating in the same room at the same time. That's actually super exciting because that means we sell more equipment. So I think under that scenario, I think it will also be good for us.</p><p>BEN LU: All right. I guess if we don't have any more questions, I want to thank everybody for attending. And for those online and especially over in Europe...</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: You have one more? Wait, we have one more.</p><p>BEN LU: Sorry. Ananda, one more?</p><p>ANANDA PROSAD BARUAH: Yes.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Good, Ananda. Good job.</p><p>ANANDA PROSAD BARUAH: Yes. Could you just give us some sense of which of the business segments are being most greatly impacted by coronavirus today? And then does that change in your Q1 view as well?</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Do you want to take that? Or you want me to start?</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: It's really -- I'll take it. It's really hard to answer that because when you talk about supply, it's kind of broad. So far, as we said, our demand is quite strong. So it's been on track. So it's really hard to say that a certain category is more impacted than another one. And as I said in my kind of close, I sort of think all of our categories are situated nicely to get the most of what you can in a world where there's a worse situation from an impact standpoint. So I don't think we could really say one is impacted worse.</p><p>I would say it's not -- I will say one thing, the impact of a video in China is interesting. It's -- so far, it's been webcams for us, but they're off very, very significantly. Now don't go raise all your numbers and everything else, but because I think the real -- the impact of having more and more people going to create Zoom, sign up for Zoom seats and Teams and Google Hangouts, I think those impacts translating into new rooms is going to come later. That's the way it works. But early days, it certainly looks kind of strongly up on the webcam side in China. So that one's on the upside. On the downside, I think it's hard for me to point to one, yet. I think it's just broadscale. If you don't have availability, you don't have availability.</p><p>ANANDA PROSAD BARUAH: Well, I do have a more just I thought of. Sorry, Ben. M&amp;A, none of us have brought it up yet. Does -- what's taking place sort of coming into this year, do you think this has you look at M&amp;A a little bit more closely? Could it impact valuations sort of to your favor?</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: I would say that there's M&amp;A that's nonpublic and then the few M&amp;A you could imagine that is public. And obviously, the overall market is down. So everything is down. That's probably a good thing from an M&amp;A standpoint. In the private markets, I don't know if it will have that big an impact on pricing. I think we've always got things we're looking at. We're looking at all the time. As I've said, it means like this before, we're always looking at stuff. We look at a whole bunch of things and we do very few. So I think the overall pricing for M&amp;A looks reasonable to me, it just comes back to finding the right things and negotiating the right kinds of deals.</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Yes.</p><p>BEN LU: Nehal?</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: So I've got a couple more questions here.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Sure.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: You guys mentioned that you now have this large installed base on the Video Collaboration, do you have data points on what is the refresh cycle within that installed base at this point in time?</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Scott, do you have a view on that? You need the microphone.</p><p>SCOTT WHARTON: Traditionally, in video conferencing or telecom, it was 7 years. I think right now we're seeing, because of the increased innovation, it's probably more 3 to 5 years of the innovation cycle and refresh cycle.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: And then you mentioned that there would be cross-selling opportunities with the Creativity &amp; Productivity. How does that mesh with the refresh cycle on that side? And do you have any cross-sell rates that you can reference as well.</p><p>SCOTT WHARTON: I can't speak to the refresh over there, but I can say that as we get installed base in one area and customers are buying stuff from us, I think as Ehrika said, I think we have an opportunity to mine our database and say, all right, you're buying a huge amount of headsets or mice and keyboards, maybe you should look at us on the VC side or vice versa. So I think that's part of the enterprise capabilities that Bracken and Ehrika talked about that we're building. Especially, we talked about on the sales side but there's also the digital marketing side that we're now cultivating to get better at, I think it's an opportunity where we can definitely exploit and do more.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: Can you speak to what's the pervasiveness of that cross-sell? Is it like 10% of the time? 50% of the time? 90% of the time?</p><p>SCOTT WHARTON: I'm not going to speak generally to that comment. Just to say that -- I would echo what Bracken said is that we have a long way to go to get better to be more world-class in terms of our cross-selling, and that is an opportunity to do more.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Yes. Can I add to that? I think the cool thing about what we're doing is, first of all, we're -- what we've done so far is with a sales organization that's good but not nowhere near great compared to what we're capable of. And we've held it back, and that's why Ehrika's here and we're going to keep investing there to be great. And as we build that capability, it's going to create new opportunities, not just in our existing products, either in services and everything. So I think this is going to unlock new opportunities that we could talk about now, but I think some of them -- we probably wouldn't even know until a year from now or 2 years from now when we're there.</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Yes. I would say the first thing on that, and Ehrika and I both kind of come from an enterprise background a little bit, we really have to earn the right in those accounts. And I think -- so that's why we're focused here initially on making sure that we really execute on VC and earn the right with those customers to have that type of relationship. But I do think that's something that has upside potential or longer-term potential for us as well.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: And my other question is on the Gaming side. Ujesh talked about taking a leadership position on wireless. And that consisted of creating your own IP with respect to reducing the lag, where does that IP sit? Is that on the software side? Is that on the semiconductor side? Can you give a little more detail on that?</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Do you want to jump in there?</p><p>UJESH DESAI: It's both. So on the software side, we're doing things like optimizing our wireless protocols. And then with the HERO sensor that I showed you, that's on the hardware side, right? So it's both. We're innovating on software as well as hardware. And then POWERPLAY, which I talked about, that's both. That's hardware and software. There's software implementations that we do, but there's hardware changes and implementations that we've done for the electromagnetic resonance charging. So it's both. We're innovating in hardware and software.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: And what was the lag reduction you're able to achieve with these 2?</p><p>UJESH DESAI: So we get to roughly 1 millisecond for our wireless products. So which is -- I mean, it's faster than any of the wired products that are out there, from the competition. So ultimately, it's gotten to the point where it's negligible, right, where no one's even complaining and it's good enough from a speed standpoint. Now there are other things we're solving, which is battery life and things like that.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: I'm sorry, did you said microsecond?</p><p>SCOTT WHARTON: 1 millisecond.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: Picosecond?</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: Millisecond.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: Millisecond, okay.</p><p>UJESH DESAI: Yes. We have a 1-millisecond improvement.</p><p>NEHAL CHOKSHI;MAXIM GROUP: 1 millisecond, got it. And what was it before you had those optimizations?</p><p>UJESH DESAI: Sorry, I don't remember off the top of my head.</p><p>BRACKEN P. DARRELL: It was noticeable. We did -- in fact, the very early days when we were first testing this, we brought a bunch of professional gamers into our offices in Switzerland, and we had -- we told them we wanted to try a new mouse at the time, none of them use wireless mice because it was -- the lag is too slow. So they all came in, the wire was -- these were connected by, so they set out their PCs -- set our PCs, set out their PCs, they tried them out. And we said, \"How is the mouse?\" They said, \"It's amazing.\" We said, \"How is the lag?\" They said, \"There is no lag. Like usual.\" And then we pulled the tables back and the wires weren't connected to anything and they were wireless. So we've been working on this for a long time.</p><p>NATHAN OLMSTEAD: Let me just say I'm glad Ujesh was here for that question.</p><p>BEN LU: All right then. I guess we'll wrap up and for anybody who is logged in from Europe, thank you for staying up around late this afternoon to listen in. Sorry for the delay this morning getting started. But I hope everybody found this very highlighting. Thank you.</p><p>BRACKEN P.

Budget problems caused by big tax cuts that the  Congressional Budget Office  projects will lead to a $2 trillion deficit[6].

Citigroup, Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan Chase all reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. Bank shares initially traded higher before falling, as the strong results were already priced in and guidance was lacklustre. This will likely be the case for many other sectors as expectations for this earnings season are sky high with earnings data registering higher growth than ever this late in the cycle. According to FactSet, S...00 earnings are forecast to have grown by 17.1 percent last quarter. Financials, meanwhile, are expected to see earnings increase by 24 percent.. 2018 has so far been a roller coaster not for the faint of heart with even veterans such as Jack Bogle [3]stating that: \"I have never seen a market this volatile to this extent in my career.\" Our Take  What should be made of this volatility? Although many are quick to point the finger at Trump's itchy 'Twitter Finger' which has lobbed challenges at Russia, China, Syria, Amazon, Robert Mueller etc. there are at least several other matters contributing to the volatility. David Rosenberg has suggested[4] some plausible factors: \"A new, untested and less dovish Fed\" led by Chairman Jerome Powell[5], who may have a less intense focus on stock market values than some of his predecessors. Budget problems caused by big tax cuts that the Congressional Budget Office projects will lead to a $2 trillion deficit[6]. A possible trade war[7] that will push up interest rates until the next recession hits. An isolationist administration when it comes to trade, which will lead to \"disrupted supply chains.\" The boost markets got last year from tax cuts and a general air of fiscal stimulus has been priced in. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's attacks on \"Big Tech,\" and Amazon in particular[8], are leading to policy uncertainty. \"Cracks\" in the synchronized global growth narrative. Belief that the world was growing together helped fuel the 2017 rally, but Rosenberg sees multiple big economies slowing down. A possible peak in corporate profits[9] that is raising the bar for expectations, meaning it will be tougher for earnings season to impress. Earnings perfection or bust?[10] Both business and consumer optimism has certainly hit rarefied air and thus nothing short of perfection will move the needle or at minimum keep it where it is... Related earnings woes, particularly from a U.S. dollar[11] that may have found a bottom after plunging during the first year of Trump's presidency. Trump has advocated for a weaker greenback as it helps make U.S. multinationals more competitive on the global stage. The wild intraday stock moves. The S...00[12] is on track for 100 days of plus-or-minus 1 percent moves, a trend that Rosenberg says typically happens during bear markets (1974, 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2009 are other years when this occurred). Circling back to the Fed, Rosenberg does not believe the central bank will come to the rescue[13] if the markets correct. Moreover, the Fed is reducing the size of its bond portfolio[14] just as the U.S. will be flooding the market with bonds to fund the burgeoning fiscal deficits. Another issue we've been monitoring lately is a widening[15] of Libor-OIS which is typically associated with heightened credit concerns. This is a metric that measures the difference between Libor (the London interbank borrowing rate where banks lend to each other unsecured)[16] and the overnight interest rate swap (the rate tracking the interest rate set by the central bank) which has shot up to more than 50 basis points. Known as the Libor-OIS, it's now at the widest it has been since the euro zone sovereign debt crisis of 2012. It widened more than 15 basis points in the February alone. A widening of Libor-OIS is generally associated with heightened credit concerns, however this time analysts [17]are pointing to several structural shifts in money markets (markets that trade in securities with short-dated maturities) rather than banking concerns \u2014 as banks are now flooded with liquidity and are generally performing better. Taken together these factors suggest a concerning picture. A significant wall of worry. As always we suggest that for the long-term investor it is a fool's game to try to time markets, yet whether we are in the 6th inning or the 9th, there are an increasing number of signs[18] and signals that the economy may be entering the late stages of economic recovery. This doesn't mean a recession is imminent, but some early warning signs are emerging that should encourage us to make preparations for a rainy day. The expansion will likely[19] extend through its ninth year, but is unlikely to accelerate and looks set to slow from here. Are our minds prepared for less? Are we ready and willing to do more with less? To make the most of less? Musings Like so many other important principles regarding successful long-term investing, the merits of training oneself to do more with less can be found when considering other disciplines. This past month I found some interesting research[20] which suggests that when people severely cut calories, they can slow their metabolism and possibly the aging process. Clinical physiologist Leanne Redman[21], who headed the study[22] at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge used participants that were not overweight and cut their typical plate for breakfast, lunch and dinner by up to 25 percent. 53 healthy volunteers were recruited and one-third ate their regular meals. The rest were on the severe calorie reduction plan for two years. Redman noticed that for those on the restricted diet, their metabolism slowed and became more efficient. \"Basically it just means that cells are needing less oxygen in order to generate the energy the body needs to survive; and so the body and the cells are becoming more energy efficient,\" Redman explains. And if less oxygen is needed to burn energy, then dangerous byproducts of that burning \u2014 free radicals[23] \u2014 can be reduced. \"Oxygen can actually be damaging to tissues and cells, and so if the cells have become more efficient, then they've got less oxygen left over that can cause this damage,\" she says. And that damage can accelerate aging. Now, these findings don't directly prove that drastic calorie-cutting will actually help people live longer. People would have to be followed for their lifetimes to prove that. But the study did find that blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides were lower in the group on severe calorie restriction. When those numbers are high, they can lead to life-shortening diseases. What can this research teach us when it comes to investing?  For the last 5 years or so, returns have been for the most part high, low hanging investment fruit has been plentiful, central banks have been accommodative and volatility has been low. Calorie intake has been high. Breakfasts, lunches and dinners have been large and our 'investor metabolisms' have slowed, their efficiency impaired. We've been lulled into ease by excess. Our expectations inflated. Instead, as storm clouds gather on the horizon, we should prepare for less. This can be done proactively by re-setting expectations and thereby \"mentally\" cutting calories leading to improvements in the efficiency of our investor metabolisms. Ultimately our ability to do more with less will likely determine not just our long-term success as investors, but also our longevity and perhaps even happiness as humans. More can in fact be less as less can be more.

It isn't intuitive so its systematically overlooked and underappreciated. More than 2,000 books are dedicated to how Warren Buffett built his fortune. Many of them are wonderful. But few pay enough attention to the simplest fact[24]: Buffett's fortune isn't due to just being a good investor, but being a good investor since he was literally a child. $80.7 billion of Warren Buffett's $81 billion net worth was accumulated after his 50th birthday. Seventy-eight billion of the $81 billion came after he qualified for Social Security, in his mid-60s. Start early. Be invested. Repeat. Lessons on Bubbles From Bitcoin. Until there is a way to bet against an asset, its price will be set by the most upbeat buyer. This suggests [25]that there's a good and easy way for regulators to reduce the incidence of bubbles. Whenever a new asset is created or a bunch of new investors enters the market, allow more futures trading and other exchanges that let pessimists publicly register their pessimistic beliefs. That won't totally prevent all bubbles -- the late 1990s technology stock bubble, for instance, happened in spite of the existence of stock futures markets. But it would certainly help. Keeping pessimists out of the market is a recipe for repeated bubbles and crashes, as overoptimistic speculators rampage unchecked. Given a level playing field, the bears can restrain the bulls. At this rate, it's going to take us nearly 400 years to transform the energy system. Here are the real reasons we're not building clean energy anywhere fast enough. Beyond the vexing combination of economic, political, and technical challenges is the basic problem of overwhelming scale. There is a massive amount that needs to be built, which will suck up an immense quantity of manpower, money, and materials. There's simply little financial incentive for the energy industry to build at that scale and speed while it has tens of trillions of dollars of sunk costs in the existing system. Should we just give up? MIT digs in[26]. Why is it so hard to invest with a social conscience? For those so inclined, the good news is this: There are more opportunities than ever to invest with a conscience. One firm, Wealthfront, will even let you strip individual American companies that rub you the wrong way from one of the index-fund-like portfolios it creates for you. But with all these choices comes a fair bit of confusion. To land the biggest blow with whatever investing dollars you have, you'll first need to confront at least seven challenges.[27] There is a lot of hype surrounding blockchain. Could it be crappy technology and also a bad vision for the future? Anti Futurist Kai Stinchcombe goes so far[28] as to say that 'Eight hundred years ago in Europe\u200a\u2014\u200awith weak governments unable to enforce laws and trusted counterparties few, fragile and far between\u200a\u2014\u200atheft was rampant, safe banking was a fantasy, and personal security was at the point of the sword. This is what Somalia looks like now, and also, what it looks like to transact on the blockchain in the ideal scenario.' The Richest 1% are on target to own 2/3rds of all wealth by 2030. Will anger over inequality[29] ever reach a tipping point? The end of scale. New technology driven business models are undercutting the traditional advantages of economies of scale. But large companies have strengths to exploit[30] if they move quickly. Is big business really that bad? The Atlantic argues[31] that large corporations are vilified in a way that obscures the innovation they spur and the steady jobs they produce. After all, entrepreneurship isn't for everyone. The grim conclusions of the largest ever study of fake news. Falsehoods always beat [32]out the truth on Twitter, penetrating further, faster and deeper into the social network than accurate information. Extremism pays. That's why Silicon Valley isn't shutting it down[33]. The tech giants' need for 'engagement' to keep revenues flowing means they are loath to stop driving viewers to ever-more unsavoury content. The show must go on! Unless Facebook's Cambridge Analytica problems are nothing[34] compared to what's coming for all of online publishing. Private Equity: Overvalued and Overrated? America is in the grips of a speculative frenzy.[35] Investment bankers, private investment firms, and even a few dozen recently graduated MBAs labelling themselves 'searchers' are calling, emailing, wining, and dining small business owners. Their goal is to translate prosaic small businesses into the poetry of private equity. This consensus has led institutional investors to flood private markets with capital, about $200 billion per year of new commitments. The result is soaring prices for private companies of all shapes and sizes. Just before the financial crisis, in 2007, the average purchase price for a PE deal was 8.9x ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\u2014a commonly used measure of cash profitability). Deal prices reached 8.9x again in 2013 and are now up to nearly 11x ebitda. But asset prices are going up everywhere. What makes private equity dangerous is the use of debt\u2014and the use of phony accounting to conceal the riskiness of these leveraged bets. Great piece suggesting that all the glitter is not gold.

Q3 2019 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[4] The 30-stock index ended the day down 255.68 points, or 0.95% to close at 26,770.20. Boeing dropped 6.8% \u2014 its biggest one-day drop since February 2016 \u2014 on news that company instant messages suggest the aerospace giant misled regulators over the safety systems of the 737 Max[5]. Johnson ...hnson slid 6.2% after the company recalled some baby powder upon finding traces of asbestos. Friday's losses wiped out the Dow's gains for the week. The index closed down 0.2% week to date. Meanwhile, S...00[6] pulled back 0.4% to end the day at 2,986.20 while the Nasdaq Composite[7] slid 0.8% to 8,089.54. Netflix shares dropped more than 6%. Facebook, meanwhile, slid 2.2% while Amazon fell 1.6%. Alphabet shares pulled back 0.4%. Both indexes were able to post solid gains for the week despite Friday's decline. The S...00 rose 0.5% week to date while the Nasdaq gained 0.4% as enthusiasm around the first batch of corporate earnings lifted market sentiment. More than 70 S...00 companies reported calendar third-quarter earnings this week. Of those companies, 81% posted better-than-expected results, FactSet data shows. It was also a brutal week[8] for the software/cloud technology sector. The worst in recent memory.Our TakeWe are currently in the middle of deflationary period for many once popular software stocks which began in late July/early August and certain names have dropped anywhere from 40-60% in a matter of months. Investing can be a popularity contest and the most dangerous thing is to buy something at the peak of its popularity. As such, we are now evaluating this group as the safest and most potentially profitable thing is to buy something no one likes. What can be made of this selloff? There are likely a variety of reasons for this repricing tied to theoverall pessimistic 'macro' narrative that continues to dominate 'popular' discourse (more on this below) yet a more simple explanation is that their valuations have gotten ahead of themselves in a market that is maturing. Aquick review of the charts of several cloud computing and software focused ETFs suggest incredible outperformance vs. the S...00 since around 2016 until about August of this year with many popular software names (Okta (OKTA), Veeva (VEEV), ServiceNow (NOW), Twilio (TWLO), Coupa (COUP))still up between 20-100% for the year. To boot, most of the cloud computing and software focused ETFs are still up between 15-25% for the year despite the selloff. Not exactly a 'blood bath'. Instead, we see this repricing as perhaps a welcome reversion to the mean as well as a maturation of the sector. A swinging of the pendulum back to reality as all new great growth stories tend to do. The reality is that many of these businesses are more economically sensitive than once thought and many are running out of runway. Competition is now fierce and so the multiples must come down. Look at history and this is nothing new. Many of these names continue to generate impressive amounts of recurring revenue, maintaining breathtaking rates of growth while solving real problems for customers. All things considered, the weakness in the space along with the weakness in demand for such issue in the IPO market (think WeWork, AirBnB, Uber, Lyft, SmileDirect, Slack etc.) all point to the other side of the 'can't lose investment idea' coin. This is healthy and rational. The greater fool theory works only until it doesn't (think WeWork). Valuation eventually comes into play, and those who are holding the bag when it does have to face the music. \"Attractive at any price' in relation to the sector is steadily morphing into simply 'attractive' on a more company specific basis. This is why we are beginning to get excited about opportunities in the space and have begun considering increasing our portfolio weighting in software and technology related services. Our focus has been on companies in the sector in the small to mid-cap arena with strong secular growth stories with real free cash flow. As such, we have started to initiate positions in companies like the following: New Relic (NEWR): Company provides analytic and data monitoring software for DevOps teams. Company is trading a little over 6x sales with ~80% gross margin. Stock is down 47% from 2018 and FCF has nearly quintupled since then. New Relic has more FCF than companies like Zscaler with a similar growth profile is trading at nearly half the market cap. Zuora (ZUO): Company provides software to utilities, industrials and other technology firms that are developing subscription services. Trading under 5.99x sales with growth in enterprise accounts over 100k at 20% and overall growth at over 40% since 2018, the company blew past quarterly earnings and raised guidance last quarter. Stock is down 61% since 2018. Upland Software (UPLD): Marked as the U.S. version of Constellation Software, the company trades at 14x next year's earnings, a little over 4x sales with FCF quadrupling since 2016. Company has been on an acquisition spree and has raised full year guidance. This is a name that may become a core. Not all technology stocks or software stocks are created equal. We believe the market has unfairly treated many SaaS providers with strong growth and cash flows by lumping in real software companies at reasonable valuations with companies that are either tremendously overvalued or that are not even technology focused to begin with. Why should Okta, which is an Oauth replacement trading at over 24x sales, be in the same conversation with some of these other high growth sticky software companies trading below 15x sales? Why is Slack, which seems to have its hands full with MSFT Teams, trading at 26x sales? While some professional investors may have an answer to these questions, we prefer to wait for compelling valuations to match compelling growth stories. In the meantime, we welcome further multiple compression among highly recurring software businesses as they will provide for interesting upside in the future. Let the baby get thrown out with the bathwaterMusingsPessimism and frustration are the words that best describe the popular sentiment at present. It has become necessary for the majority (the \"Haters Gonna Hate\" crowd) to portray every data point and every headline as negative, in the hopes of confirming their views. The facts are that we are roughly 2% off of record highs YTD for the S...00. These majority views thus haven't proven to be particularly profitable. It has been said that there are four phases in every bull market: 1) Despair 2) Disbelief (of initial rally) 3) Acceptance 4) Euphoria. We think it is safe to say that we have been through the despair phase. Next we have the disbelief phase in which a few begin to believe that things will get better but most question everything and maintain a pessimistic view holding large swathes of their portfolio in bonds, gold, utilities, non-cyclicals and even cash. Have we really moved out of this phase to acceptance? What pundit can you think of that is optimistic? There isn't a day that goes by without David Rosenberg at Gluskin Sheff calling for a recession. Don't forget Ray Dalio at Bridgewater suggesting that we are headed for the 1930s all over again. What person do you know who loves stocks right now and is suggesting that you buy? At a recent Thanksgiving celebration wewereinformed by most at the party that they had completely exited the markets as a recession was 'right around the corner'. Wecouldn't help but think that at least if these viewsprove to be incorrect onewouldn't be lonely... This is not indicative of acceptance or euphoria. Instead, webelieve the door to the acceptance phase began to open in 2017. For some, there was renewed optimism with a pro-business agenda in play. That crack in the door has been abruptly shut. Negativism is back en vogueand is pervasive anywhere you look. Just last week The American Association of Individual Investors who runs a weekly sentiment poll where participants express their view on which direction the U.S. stock market will be headed over the next six months reported that 20.3% were bullish, 35.7% were neutral and 44% were bearish. Roughly 80% of market participants are not bullishThis is a huge number. In other news, investors are flocking to the relative safety of money market funds at the highest level since the financial crisis-era collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The industry has pulled in $322 billion over the past six months, the fastest pace since the second half of 2008, bringing assets to nearly $3.5 trillion, according to data from FactSet and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. Total money market assets are now [9]at their highest level since September 2009! Today, it's all about what is going wrong, and the positives are nowhere to be found. The negative rhetoriccoming from ALLpolitical candidates across the spectrumis shocking. Watching the Democratic primary debates on TV, listening to Trump at his rallies or on Twitter or watching the Canadian Federal election debates is enough to make you lose hope for the future. Any positive data is being thrown under the rug and the person/party that can say the most shocking and negative thing appears to be the one that gets the most attention. Quite frankly the political discourse is so uninspirational that we feel confident in saying that the disbelief phase is still in progress today, and the 'haters gonna hate' sentiment presented week after week confirms that. The fearful have been joined by the frustrated, and that angry mob has grown to proportions seen during times of crisis. What to do? We have chosen to accept this market for what it is: it hasn't gone anywhere for almost 2 years, 'safety assets' are leading the market, US household financial burdens today are lower than at any time since the early 1980s, US household leverage (total liabilities as a % of total assets) has declined almost 35% since the mid 1980s, the five largest money center banks in the USA have beaten earnings estimates this quarter, the commentary from just about every Bank CEO was that: \"The consumer is ''strong', the S...00 earnings yield stands at +5.90%, growth remains ata moderate pace, inflation is tame, the Fed is dovish and so we will stay the course looking out for opportunities during the acceptance and euphoria phases. At the end of the day, if this cycle is anything like the others, the currently hyper-valued defensive stalwarts like consumer staples, interest rate sensitive investments, including REITs and utilities, and the heavily embraced bond market, are all poised to underperform dramatically, as a historic capital rotation occurs. As such, looking out into the final 2 phases of the bull market, embracing shunned economically-sensitive assets, when almost all market participants are bidding up the price of 'quality'/'safe' assets preparing for a downturn, is perhaps the perfect storm of a contrarian opportunity. As history has taught us, there is no such thing as a good investment regardless of price Charts of the Month Apparently many think we have another 2008 situation brewing as cash has become king now. <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cash.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cash.png</url>Logos LP September 2019 Performance September2019 Return:-5.13% 2019 YTD (September) Return: 24.62% Trailing Twelve Month Return: 4.67% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) since inception March 26, 2014: +14.48% Thought of the Month \"When the thumb of fear lifts we are so alive.' - Mary Oliver Articles and Ideas of Interest  Why many smart women support president Trump. Interesting piece in the WSJ[10]. \"I, too, am a college-educated, suburban woman. I am retired, and during President Trump's term my retirement fund has increased. I live in a heavily populated border state and am happy to see he is addressing the overabundance of people living here illegally. He has reduced my taxes, reduced government regulations thereby improving the business environment and giving my children and grandchildren more access to better, high-paying jobs, and he is protecting my health plan from a government takeover.\" The 'Glass Floor' is keeping America's richest idiots at the top. Elites are finding more ways to ensure that their children never run out of chances to fail[11]. In 2014, Zach Dell launched a dating app called Thread. It was nearly identical to Tinder: Users created a profile, uploaded photos and swiped through potential matches. The only twist on the formula was that Thread was restricted[12] to university students and explicitly designed to produce relationships rather than hookups. The app's tagline was 'Stay Classy.' Zach Dell is the son of billionaire tech magnate Michael Dell. Though he told reporters[13] that he wasn't relying on family money, Thread's early investors[14] included a number of his father's friends, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.The app failed almost instantly. Perhaps the number of monogamy-seeking students just wasn't large enough, or capping users at 10 matches per day limited the app's addictiveness. It could also have been the mismatch between Thread's chaste motto and its user experience. Users got just 70 characters to describe themselves on their profiles. Most of them resorted to catchphrases[15] like 'Hook 'em' and 'Netflix is life.' After Thread went bust, Dell moved into philanthropy with a startup called Sqwatt, which promised[16] to deliver 'low-cost sanitation solutions for the developing world.' Aside from an empty website[17] and a promotional video[18] with fewer than 100 views, the effort seems to have disappeared.And yet, despite helming two failed ventures and having little work experience beyond an internship at a financial services company[19] created to manage his father's fortune, things seem to be working out for Zach Dell. According to his LinkedIn profile, he is now an analyst for the private equity firm Blackstone. He is 22. Why are rich people so mean? Call it Rich Asshole Syndrome[20]\u2014the tendency to distance yourself from people with whom you have a large wealth differential. Not all millennials are woke. In Europe, young people's political views have shifted right rather than left[21]. Under-30s in Europe are more disposed than their parents are to view poverty as a result of an individual's choice. Australia's three rate cuts are making consumers even gloomier. Australian consumers are feeling their gloomiest in more than four years[22], signaling that the Reserve Bank's three recent interest-rate cuts are having the reverse intended effect. Consumer confidence dropped 5.5% to 92.8 in October, with pessimists again outweighing optimists in the monthly Westpac Banking Corp. survey. The index sunk to its lowest level since July 2015 and is down 8.4% since the central bank started cutting rates in June. 'This result will be of some concern to the monetary authorities,' said Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans. 'Typically, an interest-rate cut boosts confidence, particularly around consumers' expectations for and assessments of their own finances. In this survey, these components of the index fell by 3.7% and 4.9% respectively.' Maybe politicians will eventually realize that they will have to make some hard decisions as monetary policy has run its course and fiscal policy will need to be relied upon. You now need to make $350,000 a year to live a middle-class lifestyle in a big city. Here's a sad breakdown[23] of why. Empty hair salons can't be saved by a central bank. Struggling businesses in rural Japan show the limits of the BOJ's massive easing. There's a lesson[24] for other economies facing demographic decline. Time can make you happier than money. It's true for all ages and stages - even for recent college grads according to a new study[25]. 'People who value time make decisions based on meaning versus money,' says study leader Ashley Whillans, an assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. 'They choose to do things because they want to, not because they have to.' VC Withering? Aggregate valuations of venture-backed companies are still at an all-time high. But CB insights quarterly deep dive MoneyTree report[26] \u2014 created in partnership with PwC \u2014 shows deals and funding down almost across the board (in the geographical and industry-specific sense).

Mark Carney, who will step down from the post in March, said the financial sector was starting to curb investment in fossil fuels, but that it is \"not moving fast enough\". He made the comments in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme \u2013 guest edited by environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg \u2013 which will be broadcast on Monday. Carney said companies \"have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is\" in relation to divestment.</p><p>----------</p><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for his military and diplomats to prepare unspecified \"offensive measures\" to protect the country's security and sovereignty, the North's state media said. The call came before his end-of-year deadline for the Trump administration to make major concessions to salvage a fragile nuclear diplomacy. At a ruling Workers' Party meeting on Sunday, Kim also \"comprehensively and anatomically analysed\" problems arising in efforts to rebuild the North's moribund economy and presented tasks for \"urgently correcting the grave situation of the major industrial sectors,\" the Korean Central News Agency said. The plenary meeting of the party's Central Committee, which began on Saturday, is being closely watched amid concerns Kim could suspend his deadlocked nuclear negotiations with the Untied States and take a more confrontational approach by lifting a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests.</p><p>----------</p><p>Donald Trump faced calls from his own party to show more restraint on Twitter amid a storm of outrage Sunday over the US president revealing the name of a man widely thought to be the whistleblower who triggered his impeachment. Criticism has been growing since Trump retweeted an attack that included the name of the reported CIA staffer at the heart of the Ukraine scandal \u2013 an act that could violate the whistleblower's guaranteed anonymity under the law. Trump is ending 2019 as the third president in US history to be impeached after pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a rival in his 2020 re-election bid.</p><p>----------</p><p>BROKER RATING CHANGES</p><p>----------</p><p>BARCLAYS RAISES CARNIVAL PRICE TARGET TO 4040 (3800) PENCE - 'EQUAL WEIGHT'</p><p>----------</p><p>COMPANIES - FTSE 100</p><p>----------</p><p>Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto said it is resuming operations at Richards Bay Minerals, following discussions, led by the premier of KwaZulu-Natal, Sihle Zikalala, addressing the issues in the community. Rio Tinto had halted operations at the start of January, saying it feared for the safety of employees due to \"violence in the communities surrounding the operations\" in South Africa. The company said one employee had been shot, and seriously injured, leading to the suspension of activity at the site, which produces minerals such as ilmenite, one of the main ores of titanium. On Monday, Rio said a phased restart is now in progress, with RBM expected to return to full operations in early January, leading to regular production in early 2020.</p><p>----------</p><p>Drugmakers AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co reported that Lynparza has been approved in the US for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected pancreatic cancer. The approval follows the recommendation from the US FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for Lynparza, which was based on results from the pivotal phase III POLO trial. It showed an improvement in progression-free survival, where Lynparza nearly doubled the time patients with pancreatic cancer lived without disease progression or death.</p><p>----------</p><p>Up to 10,000 jobs at HSBC Holdings are at risk, as the lender's interim boss plans an overhaul which could also see parts of its US division axed, the Daily Mail reported on Sunday. Retail banking operations in France also could be closed, according to the newspaper. In the US, the firm is mulling the sale of branches in US cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco. Interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn is set to unveil plans for the shake-up in the company's annual results on February 18, as he looks to seal the job on a permanent basis, the Daily Mail said. In his third-quarter results statement back in October, Quinn set out the areas of the bank under scrutiny. \"Parts of our business, especially Asia, held up well in a challenging environment in the third quarter,\" Quinn said. \"However, in some parts, performance was not acceptable, principally business activities within continental Europe, the non-ring-fenced bank in the UK, and the US.\"</p><p>----------</p><p>Andy Smith is likely step down as chief executive of Smiths Group next year, after the spin-off of the engineering group's medical business is completed, the Sunday Times reported. Smith, who has been chief executive of Smiths since 2015, has been under fire since the company was forced to abandon a merger of the medical unit with American firm ICU Medical Inc, the Times reported. In September 2018, Smiths confirmed that talks with ICU for a deal fell through. According to the Times, the Smiths board was unhappy with the terms of the deal.</p><p>----------</p><p>COMPANIES - FTSE 250</p><p>----------</p><p>Entertainment One shares are to be suspended, the firm said, as it edges closer to the completion of its acquisition by US toy maker Hasbro. The trading suspension will be effective from Monday with cancellation of its shares to follow on Friday. Rhode Island-based Hasbro's takeover of Peppa Pig producer Entertainment One, which is a member of London's FTSE 250 index, was announced in August, valuing Entertainment One at GBP3.3 billion with a price per share of GBP5.60. </p><p>----------</p><p>COMPANIES - OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM</p><p>----------</p><p>BigDish, which operates a yield management platform for the restaurant industry, reported a widened pretax loss of GBP1.1 million for the six months to the end of September compared to GBP388,244 loss a year earlier, amid higher administrative expenses, which grew to GBP735,077 from GBP235,423. In addition, BigDish recorded a GBP396,277 impairment loss associated with Looloo and fees on fundraising. Revenue for the year remained insignificant, at GBP11,766 versus GBP2,448 a year ago. \"We have sufficient funding runway in order to increase the pace of restaurant acquisition which is the key performance indicator for the year ahead,\" Chief Executive Tom Sumner said. \"It is my expectation that 2020 will be a turnaround story for BigDish and our shareholders.\"</p><p>----------</p><p>COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL</p><p>----------</p><p>\"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" stayed on a strong glide path in North American theaters, taking in an estimated USD73.6 million for the three-day weekend, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported Sunday. The Walt Disney film, marketed as a grand finale of the nine-film \"Skywalker Saga,\" has had mixed reviews and was down considerably from last weekend's lofty USD177.4 million opening. But it has compiled a strong domestic total of USD364.5 million. It again maintained a big lead over the No. 2 film, Sony's \"Jumanji: The Next Level,\" an action sequel starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Kevin Hart, which had USD34.4 million in North American ticket sales for the Friday-through-Sunday period.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 59% to USD2.59 billion against USD1.63 billion in 2016. Antofagasta declared a final dividend of 40.6 cents, and a total dividend of 50.9 cents, compared to 18.4 cents in 2016 - almost tripling its payout. \"Group copper production in 2018 is expected to be in the range of 705,000 to 740,000 tonnes, higher than the 704,300 tonnes produced in 2017 as Encuentro Oxides reaches full capacity during the year.

Pretax profit increased to GBP72.0 million from GBP57.0 million in 2016. Pro-forma revenue was up at GBP1.76 billion from GBP1.69 billion the year before. The revenue is pro-forma because of the merger of Tullett Prebon and the ICAP voice-broking business to form the current TP ICAP. TP ICAP recommended an unchanged final dividend of 11.25p per share, making the total dividend for the year 16.85p per share, unchanged from that paid for 2016. \"So far in 2018 we have seen an encouraging start to the year, with a pick-up in volatility and interest rates. Although it is too early to tell whether these conditions are sustainable, our diversified business model and position as the world's largest interdealer broker leave us well-placed for future growth,\" said Chief Executive John Phizackerley.<br/>----------<br/>COMPANIES - LONDON MAIN MARKET AND AIM<br/>----------<br/>Fevertree Drinks said it continued to deliver strong growth across all regions, channels, flavours and formats with the UK once again delivering an exceptional performance for 2017.

The supervisory board of E.ON approved the transaction on Sunday and the supervisory board of RWE followed. In connection with the transaction, E.ON proposed a dividend of EUR0.43 per share for 2018. The board also confirmed a target rating of a strong BBB/Baa for E.ON. Separately, E.ON reported that its adjusted net income for 2017 was EUR1.4 billion, which surpassed the prior-year figure by 58%. Adjusted EBIT of EUR3.1 billion was at the upper end of the forecast range of EUR2.8 billion to EUR3.1 billion. Alongside solid 2017 earnings, debt-reduction measures such as the roughly EUR3.8 billion in proceeds anticipated in mid-2018 from the agreed-on sale of the Uniper stake to Fortum will give E.ON additional flexibility. E.ON said it intends to use this flexibility to achieve disciplined, profitable growth during the implementation of the transaction with RWE.<br/>----------<br/>RWE also published its results Tuesday, reporting its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for 2017 was EUR5.8 billion, up from EUR5.4 billion in 2016. At EUR1.9 billion, net income was substantially higher than last year, when a net loss of EUR5.7 billion was reported due to impairments. Adjusted net income came in at EUR1.2 billion, well higher than last year's result of EUR0.8 billion. For 2018, RWE projects adjusted EBITDA in a range of EUR4.9 billion to EUR5.2 billion, and adjusted net income between EUR700 million and EUR1.0 billion.<br/>----------<br/>Apple said it has agreed to buy Texture, a digital magazine subscription service owned by Next Issue Media.

The banking and insurance regulators will become a single entity, as China is aiming to streamline administration and improve its prevention of financial risks.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 59% to USD2.59 billion against USD1.63 billion in 2016. Antofagasta declared a final dividend of 40.6 cents, and a total dividend of 50.9 cents, compared to 18.4 cents in 2016 - almost tripling its payout. \"Group copper production in 2018 is expected to be in the range of 705,000 to 740,000 tonnes, higher than the 704,300 tonnes produced in 2017 as Encuentro Oxides reaches full capacity during the year. This will be partially offset by lower mined grades. Production is expected to grow quarter-by-quarter through the year as grades improve with approximately 45% of the year's production expected to be produced in the first half of the year,\" Antofagasta said.----------Anglo-South African financial services company Old Mutual said Travelers Cos and St Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co have lodged a claim in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York in relation to previously disposed US assets.

Pretax profit increased to GBP72.0 million from GBP57.0 million in 2016. Pro-forma revenue was up at GBP1.76 billion from GBP1.69 billion the year before. The revenue is pro-forma because of the merger of Tullett Prebon and the ICAP voice-broking business to form the current TP ICAP. TP ICAP recommended an unchanged final dividend of 11.25p per share, making the total dividend for the year 16.85p per share, unchanged from that paid for 2016. \"So far in 2018 we have seen an encouraging start to the year, with a pick-up in volatility and interest rates. Although it is too early to tell whether these conditions are sustainable, our diversified business model and position as the world's largest interdealer broker leave us well-placed for future growth,\" said Chief Executive John Phizackerley.----------COMPANIES - LONDON MAIN MARKET AND AIM----------Fevertree Drinks said it continued to deliver strong growth across all regions, channels, flavours and formats with the UK once again delivering an exceptional performance for 2017. Pretax profit surged to GBP56.4 million from GBP34.3 million the year before. Revenue was up 66% to GBP170.2 million compared to GBP102.2 million in 2016. The tonic water maker proposed a final dividend 7.64p, which brings the total payout to 10.65p. \"We have had an encouraging start to 2018 and I look forward to working with my board colleagues and the wider Fevertree team to continue to deliver growth,\" said Chairman Bill Ronald. ----------COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL----------E.ON and RWE concluded their agreement on the acquisition of RWE's 76.8% stake in innogy SE via a far-reaching exchange of assets and participations. The supervisory board of E.ON approved the transaction on Sunday and the supervisory board of RWE followed. In connection with the transaction, E.ON proposed a dividend of EUR0.43 per share for 2018. The board also confirmed a target rating of a strong BBB/Baa for E.ON. Separately, E.ON reported that its adjusted net income for 2017 was EUR1.4 billion, which surpassed the prior-year figure by 58%. Adjusted EBIT of EUR3.1 billion was at the upper end of the forecast range of EUR2.8 billion to EUR3.1 billion. Alongside solid 2017 earnings, debt-reduction measures such as the roughly EUR3.8 billion in proceeds anticipated in mid-2018 from the agreed-on sale of the Uniper stake to Fortum will give E.ON additional flexibility. E.ON said it intends to use this flexibility to achieve disciplined, profitable growth during the implementation of the transaction with RWE.----------RWE also published its results Tuesday, reporting its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for 2017 was EUR5.8 billion, up from EUR5.4 billion in 2016. At EUR1.9 billion, net income was substantially higher than last year, when a net loss of EUR5.7 billion was reported due to impairments. Adjusted net income came in at EUR1.2 billion, well higher than last year's result of EUR0.8 billion. For 2018, RWE projects adjusted EBITDA in a range of EUR4.9 billion to EUR5.2 billion, and adjusted net income between EUR700 million and EUR1.0 billion.----------Apple said it has agreed to buy Texture, a digital magazine subscription service owned by Next Issue Media.

'The tech giants are huge beasts and there is a growing sense of unease about their power,' he said.</p><p><br/><br/>Last November the attorney-general of the US state of Missouri launched an investigation into Google to establish whether it had broken antitrust and consumer protection laws. Other states are also examining the power that Google gains through collecting consumer data.<br/><br/>In Europe, Margrethe Vestager, the European Competition Commissioner, is about to hit Google with an antitrust fine of hundreds of millions of euros or more over its advertising network AdSense. The commission alleges that Google's contracts with other websites broke competition law by preventing them from using other firms' advertising networks within those websites' search results.<br/><br/>Last June the commission ordered Google to pay E2.4 billion (GBP2.1 billion) for abusing its internet search monopoly to promote its online shopping service - a record penalty for a European competition case. Facebook was fined E110 million (GBP94 million) by the EU last year for providing misleading information about its takeover of WhatsApp in 2014. At the time, the company told the commission it wouldn't be able to match user accounts on the two platforms before doing just that.<br/><br/>Professor Birkinshaw believes this is just the beginning: 'Over the coming year we can expect to see more of this aggressively activist approach in tackling companies with dominant positions.'<br/><br/>The current regulatory and competition regimes were designed more than a century ago for traditional corporations. They can't deal cope with tech companies whose profitability increases as they rapidly scale. 'Companies such as Google and Facebook operate in ways that don't fit the old supplier-manufacture-distributor-consumer model for which antitrust legislation was designed,' said Professor Birkinshaw.<br/><br/>Facebook now has more than two billion active monthly users. Google handles 42% of all digital advertising in the US and has more than four-fifths of online search advertising. Amazon has focused single-mindedly on growth rather than profits, and has successfully expanded well beyond its original domain as an online retailer, he said.<br/><br/>The tech titans show no sign of slowing down: 'The more people who join Facebook or use Google, the more data the company can mine. The economies of scale become ever greater. So we need to rethink the way we monitor the power of the huge companies now dominating the business landscape.'<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]     </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RCS-XVC1-F0K1-N557-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 11, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I report on tech policy from The Times's bureau in Washington. But this past week, one of the biggest stories began with an announcement an ocean away.</p><p>  For weeks, we had been waiting to see whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson would allow Huawei equipment to be used in Britain's 5G wireless network or follow American officials in shutting the company out. The United States has said for years that the company's networking gear could give the Chinese government access to key infrastructure.</p><p>  On Tuesday, Mr. Johnson revealed his decision: Huawei is in. The company's equipment can be used in a portion of the 5G, or fifth-generation, network.</p><p>  This is a big setback for the Trump administration's global anti-Huawei push. The White House had sent top officials to London to try to sway Mr. Johnson, a close ally. Shortly after the British announcement, the European Union told its members to limit but not totally eliminate Huawei's role in their network.</p><p>  I messaged Adam Satariano, who covers tech in Europe from The Times's London bureau, to find out more about the fallout from Mr. Johnson's choice.</p><p>  Why did Boris Johnson make the decision to allow Huawei to stay involved in building Britain's 5G network, despite all the pressure he was under from the Trump administration?</p><p>  There are a few key reasons. First, a practical one. Huawei has been part of the British telecom network for years. 5G will be built on top of that existing system. To implement a ban now would be extraordinarily costly and delay the rollout of the faster network because a lot of that old kit would have to be ripped out.</p><p>  Second, British intelligence and cybersecurity officials believe the risks of Huawei can be mitigated. As part of allowing Huawei to be part of its network, British officials years ago required the company to subject its products and code to tests. There's a lab near Cambridge where this is done. For British officials, this gives them a level of confidence that the problem can be managed. Of course, American officials think this is wishful thinking. With 5G, software plays a much bigger role, meaning it will be harder to keep harmful code from slipping through.</p><p>  Finally, as Britain exits the European Union, it can't afford to alienate China, which is a big investor in the country and a growing buyer of British exports. From an economic standpoint, it would be a big risk. Britain also sees 5G as a key to the country's economic future, and any delays could put it at a disadvantage to other countries.</p><p>  Here in Washington, Mr. Johnson's decision set off a paroxysm of concerned statements from the administration and hawkish members of Congress. What has the reaction been like in Britain?</p><p>  I think it was expected. The statement from the White House was actually quite mild. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo still went forward with a trip to Britain during the week. Perhaps harsher words were shared behind closed doors.</p><p>  This Huawei decision is also just one example of a split between how tech is regulated in the United States and in Britain. What's the future of the special relationship when it comes to tech?</p><p>  Complicated. Like many countries in Europe, Britain is very frustrated with Big Tech. It doesn't think the companies pay their fair share in taxes. And with Facebook and Google/YouTube, not enough is done to limit the spread of harmful content. Attempts to address taxes and harmful content will gain momentum this year, potentially setting up more tension with the United States.</p><p>  It's late in London, so I've got just one more: You cover all of Europe, not just Britain. Where does the American campaign to keep Huawei out of 5G networks go next?</p><p>Germany is another country where the United States has been applying a lot of pressure. But as our colleagues Katrin Bennhold and Jack Ewing recently reported, it also faces a tough decision. China has threatened to retaliate if Huawei is banned. That is not an insignificant threat for Germany, which sells a lot of BMWs and VWs to China. Chancellor Angela Merkel has signaled she doesn't want a ban, but she is facing pressure from others in government who want to take a more aggressive approach.</p><p>  It's a fascinating issue, touching on tech, trade, politics, foreign policy and national security.</p><p>  How tech is shaping the coronavirus story</p><p>  Three stories during the week underscored how the news around the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China -- and the way the public has responded -- is being mediated by online platforms.</p><p>  The Times's Raymond Zhong reported from Shanghai on the way that anger over the Chinese government's handling of the outbreak has boiled over on social media.</p><p>  Not surprisingly, the virus has also been the subject of online disinformation. BuzzFeed News's Jane Lytvynenko had a good roundup, including posts with false statements about how many people are affected and the authorities' response.</p><p>  But in The Atlantic, Alexis Madrigal noted that it was important to remember that while ''out-and-out conspiracies and hoaxes will draw some attention, it's really the stuff that's close to the boundaries of discourse that grabs the most eyeballs.''</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  Workers in Amazon or Walmart warehouses often sort through bins of random objects, looking for the right one to send off for packaging and delivery to consumers.

Khan will speak at the SXSW tech conference in Texas, where he will also criticise the government for not updating laws fast enough to keep up companies trying to take advantage of legal loopholes. Khan is expected to acknowledge the huge amount of racist abuse he receives on Twitter to highlight social media's problem with hate speech. </p><p>Khan presides over the most successful tech hub in Europe, so he can't afford to alienate tech companies entirely. London mayor Sadiq Khan will attack Google, Facebook, and Twitter for not doing enough to delete hate speech and abuse from their platforms in a wide-ranging speech on tech and inclusivity on Sunday. Khan's speech, due to take place at the SXSW tech conference in Texas, will also criticise Uber and its peers in the \"gig economy\" for circumventing laws around worker rights and pay. He is expected to say: \"Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have brought huge benefits to society. They've made it easier for us to stay in touch with those we love, meet like-minded people and have easier access to information we want. But \u2014 understandably \u2014 there are growing concerns about the way some of the biggest companies on the planet are impacting our lives and the overall wellbeing of our societies. In some cases, these new platforms have been used to exacerbate, fuel and deepen the divisions within our communities.\" Khan will highlight the problems of fake news, algorithm bias, election interference, and the rise of online abuse. He will say that Facebook, Twitter, and Google can remove offensive content and misinformation faster. If they don't, they must face government-imposed fines. \"[More] countries will start to follow or go further than what Germany has done,\" he is expected to say. \"The German government have changed the law so that social media companies face hefty fines if they fail to quickly remove hate speech, fake news and illegal material.\" Germany began enforcing a new in January that gives social media firms just 24 hours to decide if something is hate speech. German police are already investigating far-right politician Beatrix von Storch[1] after she described Muslims as \"barbarians\" on Facebook and Twitter. Khan will reference London's continuing battle with ride-sharing service Uber, which lost its licence in September 2017 over a number of regulatory problems[2]. The company is still operational in the city while it fights a legal battle with London's transport regulator. Khan will say: \"In London, we've been clear with Uber and other companies that everyone \u2014 no matter how big or small \u2014 must play by the rules. No exceptions.\"Sadiq Khan can't afford to alienate one of the UK's most important sectorsNot everything is about blame. Khan will acknowledge that the UK government had sat on its hands while services like Uber and Airbnb rewrote the rulebook around issues such as the minimum wage, employee status, and local planning. He will say: \"Rather than blaming companies for innovating ahead of regulation, politicians must fix things when the regulation is out-of-date. The question now for governments \u2014 or traditional sectors \u2014 should not be how we slow down innovation in its tracks \u2014 because we can't. And we shouldn't. It should be how we mitigate against the potentially negative impacts of disruption. And - more than that - how we can harness the very same technologies to drive up standards and to create more just and equal societies.\" Khan must tread carefully when it comes to creating anti-tech sentiment. Another gig economy company, food delivery startup Deliveroo, is one of the UK's best-known startups and has attracted almost $1 billion (715 million) in funding[3]. And British AI startup DeepMind was acquired by one of the major firms being criticised by Khan: Google. UK tech startups attract more venture capital funding than any other country in Europe, and most of that money flows to London. The threat of stricter regulation, as well as Brexit, may threaten London's status as the European tech capital.NOW WATCH: Watch how pillows are made[4]See Also: Here are the most popular Google

The mayor said that governments have been in \"dereliction of duty\" when it comes to passing regulations to combat the ways technology has negatively affected society. He specifically pointed to the way technology has been used to tamper with elections, spread false information and further polarize public discourse.</p><p>\"One of the biggest problems over the last few years is that politicians and governments have just been passive - sitting on their hands - while the tech revolution has happened around them,\" Khan said in his remarks, which were live-streamed on Facebook.</p><p>Ultimately, he said, it's up to governments - including at the city level - to work with technology businesses and leaders to make sure that technological advancement has the proper checks. He drew parallels to the way governments dealt with the first Industrial Revolution, which prompted new laws such as labor reforms to deal with the way technology and a move toward factory work upended the world's agrarian society.</p><p>\"Rather than blaming companies for innovating ahead of regulation, politicians must fix things when the regulation is out of date,\" he said.</p><p>While Khan aimed his most pointed criticisms at his fellow lawmakers, he still called on companies such as Facebook and Twitter to deal more quickly with bad content on their networks.</p><p>Khan is known for being pro-business and pro-tech. He has lobbied heavily to make London a world technology hub. Like President Trump - with whom he has had a number of Twitter spats - Khan is active on social media. (In his speech, Khan said he hoped his speech would not generate new tweets from Washington.)</p><p>But as a progressive politician and London's first Muslim <person><nameText>mayor, Khan </nameText></person>has been a target of right-wing criticism, in person and online. In a key part of his address, Khan shared for the first time a half-dozen personal attacks he has fielded on social media.</p><p>\" 'I'd pay for someone to execute <person><nameText>Sadiq Khan,</nameText></person>' \" he read, quoting a message representative of the \"loads\" of comments he said he sees every day. Other harassers also called for him to be killed, referred to Khan as a terrorist or called to have all Muslims deported to \"make London white again.\" He said that he shared this personal abuse to ask what effect this sort of rhetoric has on people, particularly young men and women.</p><p>Khan said that tech companies must take greater responsibility for the type of content shared on their platforms. \"[With] the skills and resources these companies have at their disposal - I believe it's possible to go further and faster,\" he said.</p><p>Social media firms are already under new regulatory pressure in Europe, thanks to German laws enacted in January that will fine companies that don't take down problematic content within 24 hours of it being reported.</p><p>Khan did not call for this type of regulation Monday but warned that even stricter regulation could be on its way if companies don't respond to government concerns.</p><p>\"If this doesn't happen, then more countries will start to follow or go further than what Germany has done,\" he said. \"Ultimately - there must be greater responsibility taken by some tech companies for the impact they're having on the world. And, crucially, no business or industry should ever consider itself above the local rules, or laws set by democratic processes.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-93fdb0c425194f26a8a5819a6b44c33f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RVP-KHW1-JB4M-V52D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><timeReceived>8:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 12, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

Speaking at Business Insider's UK Tech 100[2] party on Thursday night, Khan said there are \"challenges facing the digital sector\" and that collaboration, rather than heavy-handed regulation, will be needed to put things right. \"It is a reality that we have seen elections influenced by technology. It is a reality that we've seen people radicalised by technology. It is a reality we've seen the promotion of hatred, particularly against women and minorities,\" he told a room full of British tech talent at the top of The Gherkin in London. \"The way to address those concerns isn't to destroy that innovation, it's for the tech sector to work with politicians to try and grapple with some of these problems.\" Khan, who featured at number 40 on the UK Tech 100 ranking[3], was speaking at a time when it looks increasingly likely that Britain will introduce new regulations for Silicon Valley's behemoths. Influential Conservative MP Damian Collins, who also features on the Tech 100 list, told Business Insider that regulation is coming[4], with firms like Facebook set to be held to higher standards on things like illegal hate speech. Khan added that he wants to make London the tech capital of the world. \"London is the tech capital of Europe and my mission is for us to be the tech capital of the world. Not just because I'm competitive, but because I can see a difference tech makes to reshaping our society, reshaping our economy, and reshaping our culture,\" he said. The London Mayor also praised the breadth of talent represented on the Tech 100 list. He said: \"It shows the ecosystem is so diverse, from whistleblowers, journalists and chairs of select committees, to those involved in giant tech companies, those involved in startups.\"NOW WATCH:

Speaking at Business Insider's UK Tech 100 party on Thursday night, Khan said there are \"challenges facing the digital sector\" and that collaboration, rather than heavy-handed regulation, will be needed to put things right.</p><p><br/> \"It is a reality that we have seen elections influenced by technology.

Not just because I'm competitive, but because I can see a difference tech makes to reshaping our society, reshaping our economy, and reshaping our culture,\" he said. The London Mayor also praised the breadth of talent represented on the Tech 100 list. He said: \"It shows the ecosystem is so diverse, from whistleblowers, journalists and chairs of select committees, to those involved in giant tech companies, those involved in startups.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10687151</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDR-58P1-JBYT-H27K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"318\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 5, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The top transportation authority there says it will not renew Uber's license. The ride-hailing service is appealing that decision. And in the meantime, Uber can keep operating. London's move is being applauded by taxi drivers, as you might expect, but many Uber customers are not so happy. NPR's Chris Arnold reports.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRIS ARNOLD:                 In London today, people are being forced to envision life without Uber cars. It's a bleak vision for Yurr-Ann Chin and Svenya Tishmyer (ph).             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:                 Taxis are so expensive in London, so I usually rely on Uber at the moments during the night to get home from bars or clubs because the Tube doesn't go at night.             </p><p>CHRIS ARNOLD:                 Of course people could try to grab one of those stately looking black cabs. Arun Sundararajan is a business professor at NYU who was born in the U.K.             </p><p>ARUN SUNDARARAJAN:                 Of all the cities in the world, London's taxi service is perhaps the most iconic - you know, black cabs driving around - and most closely tied to the identity of the city.             </p><p>CHRIS ARNOLD:                 And because of that, there could be some politics going on here to protect the taxi drivers. And Sundararajan says that the move could also be a part of a more general backlash against big tech companies from abroad.             </p><p>ARUN SUNDARARAJAN:                 The fact that it is a non-European or non-British platform that is dominating what used to be a locally provided service.             </p><p>CHRIS ARNOLD:                 OK, but there is still a reason that Uber is popular in London.             </p><p>JACOB KIRKEGAARD:                 Anybody who has taken a black cab in London knows that this is a pricey service that is not always available where you need it.             </p><p>CHRIS ARNOLD:                 That's Jacob Kirkegaard, an economist with the Peterson Institute. He says London's subway, or Tube system, is crowded.             </p><p>JACOB KIRKEGAARD:                 London is a city whose infrastructure greatly benefits from the, in many ways, complimentary service of a company like Uber.             </p><p>CHRIS ARNOLD:                 But he says a series of glaringly bad missteps by the company has left it vulnerable. Perhaps the worst, the ride-hailing service angered regulators around the world with its so-called Greyball program which deceived officials by showing them fake Uber cars when they looked at the app.             </p><p>JACOB KIRKEGAARD:                 There is a federal criminal investigation here in the United States that they used this Greyball software to basically trick local regulators so that they couldn't identify individual drivers, so they couldn't check the identity of these drivers. That is a serious charge.             </p><p>CHRIS ARNOLD:                 Traditional taxi companies have pointed to sexual assault complaints against Uber drivers to raise safety concerns, and the London regulators faulted the company's approach to reporting, quote, \"serious criminal offenses.\" Uber says it complies with the same background checks that the cab drivers undergo in London and that it works closely with police. In the end, Kirkegaard thinks that London might force some changes on Uber, but he would be surprised if the city actually bans Uber cars.             </p><p>JACOB KIRKEGAARD:                 The U.K. is voting for Brexit, and you know, they really want to send the signal, we're still open for business. Banning a cheap source of transportation within the city is a step in the other direction.             </p><p>CHRIS ARNOLD:                 Meanwhile, today more than 300,000 people have already signed an online petition asking the mayor to reverse the decision to ban Uber in London.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p> In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p> MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p> BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p> BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p> MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p> BAKER:  OK.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p> They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p> A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p> Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p> NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p> DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p> And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p> So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p> And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p> Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p> Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p> And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p> CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p> BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p> BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p> I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p> CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p> MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p> KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p> BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p> KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p> KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p> KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p> Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.  What we know about the attacker this morning.   Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.  </p><p> Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues.  The  Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire  Whole Foods.  The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning!  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p> Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p> And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.  Brooks Koepka,  making a name for himself at U.S. Open.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Koepka, a major champion </p><p> (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The impact on one of his main sponsors; we'll take a look at  the shares of Nike coming up.  Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p> WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p> PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p> PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p> But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p> PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p> PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na[ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p> MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p> BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p> MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p> CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p> PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p> We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p> MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p> MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p> BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p> Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p> And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p> CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p> MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p> BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p> MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p> CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.

We've got all the highlights.</p><p> What's old is new again apparently.  Atari makes a comeback with a new  console.  This is the first new console in 20 years.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it: the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter is here; the CEO of  Rosecliff Mike Murphy is here; and the president of Diligence Mike Baker is  here.  Great to see you.</p><p> MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot on deck today.</p><p> BAKER:  Good morning.</p><p> LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Sure is.  Some great guests, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got important guests coming up to talk about what's  going on in London.  We're going to take you live to London momentarily.</p><p> The story out of the White House this morning in terms of technology and  Mike these markets are looking firmer.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Firm, new highs and I think there is a bit  underneath the market.  A lot of negatives out there but the market, as  they say, finds a wall of worry and that's what we're getting right now --  earnings supporting higher prices.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning: the counselor to  President Trump Kellyanne Conway is here -- don't miss that.  She's coming  up this hour.</p><p> First though new questions surrounding whether President Trump is actually  under investigation or not by the special counsel looking into Russia's  alleged election meddling.</p><p> On Friday the President tweeted this.  \"I'm being investigated for firing  the FBI director by the man who told me to fired the FBI director.  Witch  hunt.\"</p><p> But yesterday a member of the President's legal team contradicted that  tweet.  Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAY SEKULOW, MEMBER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM:  The President has not  been notified by anyone that he is under investigation.  That tweet, Chris  was in response to the \"Washington Post\" story that alleged that five  unnamed sources, anonymous sources linked to the \"Washington Post\" that the  President was in fact under investigation.  So that tweet was in response  to that.  </p><p> There has been no notification of any investigation.  Nothing has changed  since James Comey said the President was not a target or a subject of  investigation.  Nothing's changed.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst right now,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- good to see.  Good morning.</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on all of this.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, I think it's a little bit in the weeds because if you  have the former FBI director making a case for attempted obstruction of  justice or even bribery against the President of the United States and  making it in a fairly forceful way.  Whatever you think of him as an FBI  director, that is certainly enough to trigger an investigation.</p><p> So I think both sides are right.  I think that the President is being  investigated but he is not a target.  A target means they plan to bring  charges against you.  So when Jay Sekulow says he hasn't gotten a target  letter that it's probably technically true but it doesn't mean that he's  not been investigated.</p><p> State differently the FBI must investigate allegations of the nature and  quality that James Comey alleged in that senate testimony that he gave.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I don't know why the President feels the need to respond  to something like a \"Washington Post\" report.  He calls them fake news  anyway.  So why respond?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he has had tremendous success in energizing  his base -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  I know.  I get that.  I get that.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- with his tweets.  No human being in the modern era has had  the success that he has in communicating with his supporters and bypassing  the media.</p><p> But this is a dangerous area for him because we now see federal judges  taking literally Sean Spicer's statement.  The President's tweets official  government communications and federal judges using statements made in the  tweets to undermine oral arguments that his Justice Department is making in  court.</p><p> So he at times while undermining the base may be working at cross purposes  with what his Justice Department is trying to persuade federal judges.</p><p> BAKER:  This may not be a fair question, Judge but what is your gut  feeling?  Where is this going?  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  I don't know.  I wish I did.  I don't know where it's going  but I do believe that -- as I just said to all of you -- the allegations  that James Comey made were said with such credibility and confidence that  they can't be ignored and they will investigated.</p><p> Now, here is a good side of this.  Sometimes the FBI in the early stages  before you are a subject down here, before you're a target up here you are  sort of in the mix.  They may want to exclude certain people from becoming  subjects and targets and in order to do that they have to conduct an  investigation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, I think we should start looking at where the real  obstructionism has been in that where we know it was.  Senate Republicans  are now turning their attention and their investigative eyes to former  attorney general Loretta Lynch.  Some are saying that they want her to  testify after alarming accusations by the former director, Jim Comey, in  his recent congressional testimony.</p><p> Here is one thing he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  At one point the Attorney General had  directed me not to call it an \"investigation\" but instead to call it a  \"matter\" which confused me and concerned me.  But that was one of the  bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the  department if we are going to close this case credible.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So that was one of three things people are talking about in  terms of why Loretta Lynch needs to be investigated.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Number one, the matter versus investigation.  Number two, the  tarmac meeting -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- two days before Hillary Clinton was to testify, she met with  her husband President Clinton on the plane.</p><p> And number three, apparently there is a memo floating around that has not  been widely disseminated but basically says -- suggests that Loretta Lynch  I will be getting involved.  I'll make sure the FBI investigation of  Clinton doesn't go too far.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Now, we don't know if this memo exists.  But the reports on  the memo are the recipient of it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- the then chair of the Democratic National Committee.  Now  this was back before the DNC, when Bernie Sanders' candidacy was still  alive and Mrs. Clinton had not yet been exonerated by Jim Comey.  Just as I  said that Comey painted enough of a serious case against the President to  warrant investigation by the special prosecutor.</p><p> He clearly painted enough of a case against Loretta Lynch to be  investigated by not the senate judiciary committee but the same FBI, the  regular FBI, the Justice Department -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- and not the special prosecutor.</p><p> Now, it is odd and has only happened in rare instances that an attorney  general investigates his predecessor.  It happened, of course when John  Mitchell, Richard Nixon's Attorney General was prosecuted and convicted and  went to jail.  </p><p> But I am telling you there are enough allegations stated in a credible way,  supported by other forensic evidence like we saw pictures of her with Bill  Clinton -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- to warrant a criminal investigation of Mrs. Lynch for  misconduct in office.  Did she use the Justice Department as a political  instrument to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not to mention all of the spying that went on and the  unmasking.  Then there's that.  I am just throwing this out there because  there is a fair amount of things out there to investigate -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- at this point.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  but remember, this is not Bob Mueller.  This is Jeff Sessions  -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- and whoever is running.  It is still Andrew McCabe because  -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- Christopher Wray has not yet been confirmed.  It is the  regular DOJ that should be investigating her.</p><p> BAKER:  What I worry and this is what happens in Washington it seems like  all the time which is all these various issues now get molded together, the  public becomes utterly confused over where we're going with this.  And  eventually it all goes away and dies.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now it gives the impression of either scandal or  instability, neither of which is good to give that impression coming from  the Justice Department which is supposed to be relatively neutral -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- doing the right thing, enforcing the rule of law devoid of  politics and above the fray.  It doesn't seem to be that way right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is why I brought up the memo because there is also  speculation that is totally fake -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- I mean does it exist or not.  We don't know.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  We do know that the \"matter\" thing is true because -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The \"matter\" is true.  He testified under oath.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You'll get a peek at this because Mike -- you live in this  environment.  FBI agents were poking the director in the ribs saying,  you're now the director of the federal bureau of matters.  It's a criminal  investigation -- where is this \"matter\" nonsense coming from? </p><p> BAKER:  We've got to change the logo.  It's going to cost money.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right. Let's talk about a case that has really rocked  Hollywood and that is, of course, Bill Cosby; a shocking outcome to the  Bill Cosby sexual assault trial yesterday.  The judge declared a mistrial  after the jury was deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberation.</p><p> Judge -- what does this mean for the case against the comedian?  Walk us  through what a mistrial looks like.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  A judge must determine that no further deliberation time is  likely to change anybody's opinion.  Now we don't know if it's 11 to 1 or 6  to 6 or some combination.  Obviously you need unanimity for a conviction  and unanimity for acquittal.  And they didn't have unanimity.</p><p> Some judges will just ask the jury foreman, can you tell me Madam Foreman,  whether or not in your opinion any further deliberation will help.  Some  judges -- this is what I used to do were asked each individual juror.   Don't tell me how you're voting.  That's none of my business.  I want to  know if you still have an open mind or if you are steadfast and nothing  else will change that opinion.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll see.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  And once the judge comes to that conclusion well then it's  simply a waste of time.  The prosecutors have announced that they will  retry him probably in the fall or the winter.</p><p> This is a very, very strange case because he received a promise, Bill  Cosby, from a prosecutor don't worry you're not going to be prosecuted you  can give a deposition into what happened.  He gave the deposition, the  prosecutor died.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.</p><p> NAPOLITANO: The new prosecutor can -- the judge said, the promise is only  good for as long as he's the prosecutor.  So they can use your own words  against you.  That's called a built-in appeal.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is extraordinary.  That's incredible.  </p><p> Judge -- thank you.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great insights as always from you.  Judge Napolitano.</p><p> The U.K. authorities are now investigating that van attack near the London  mosque early this morning as a possible terrorist attack.  </p><p>Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is on the ground in  London right now with the very latest.  Benjamin -- good morning to you.</p><p> BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you  from London.  Well, yet another attack hitting London over here but, of  course, what it so s strikingly different in this case is that this was an  attack on Muslims.  Of course, we have seen vehicles being used time and  time again.  But not like this.</p><p> And as you said, this is now being treated as an act of terrorism and  investigated by the counter terrorism unit.  It happened just after  midnight here in Finchley, north London outside a Muslim center.  At a time  when the neighborhood was crowded with Muslims finishing Ramadan prayers.   It seems that the attacker knew when prayers ended and he was waiting.</p><p> Muslim leaders have now called it a hate crime and they've asked the public  to stay calm and try to avoid divisions within the community.</p><p> Police have arrested the driver.  He's a 48-year-old white man.    He was  grappled to the ground by two bystanders until the police could arrive.   Those two men are being called heroes.</p><p> Eyewitnesses have also reported that he said a number of times \"I've done  my bit\" and \"I want to kill Muslims.\"</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He did what he did deliberately to hit and kill as many  Muslims as possible.  So he is a terrorist.  So at this stage we are  calling for calm.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HALL:  And the video has also emerged showing the attacker apparently  blowing a kiss from the police van that he was been taken away.  He's been  taken to the hospital.  He's going to be charged when he is let out of  there.</p><p> But a lot of people are saying this is exactly what ISIS wanted.   (inaudible) the narrative.  It helps to create even greater divisions.  And  so right here where we are now in London very much on edge.  It's a very  multi-ethnic, very diverse neighborhood and the police really are just  trying to keep it safe, keep it under control.  The Prime Minister coming  out as well and saying this was not only an attack on this community.  It  was an attack on the whole of the country.  Back to you guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Benjamin -- thank you.  Benjamin Hall will get back  to you as news develops there.</p><p> Coming up -- Google cracks down on terrorism -- how technology giant says  it is combating the spread of extremism on YouTube.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The acting secretary of the Navy has promised a  full investigation into a collision between the destroyer a container ship  off of the coast of Japan.  It killed seven sailors.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the story now -- Cheryl</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria -- of course the story  developing over the weekend.  That collision happened early Saturday  morning as many of the crew slept.  Secretary Sean Stackley praised the  crewmembers for saving the USS Fitzgerald from further damage and bringing  it back into part.  And of course, the sad story is they find those  sailors.</p><p> Representative Steve Scalise's condition, we should say, has now been  upgraded to serious from critical.  According to Medstar Washington  Hospital Center, the congressman had more surgery over the weekend but he  does continue to show signs of improvement.  </p><p> And Scalise did not let his health crisis get in the way of father's day.   He said on the father's day message on twitter, saying quote, \"Steve's  greatest joy is being a father to Madison and Harrison and a husband to  Jennifer.  This father for the Scalise family and they send their best  wishes to every family especially the dads.  Take the time to be close to  the ones that you love.</p><p> Of course Scalise, one of five people wounded last week when a gunman  opened fire on Republicans at a baseball practice in suburban, Virginia.</p><p> Well, tomorrow's special election in Georgia.  It's too close to call.  And  the two candidates are scrambling for last-minute votes.  The race between  Republican Karen Handle and Democratic Jon Ossoff is seen as a key test for  Republican swing voters, uneasy with President Trump's policies.  </p><p> And Atari is back in the hardware business.  The company says it's making a  video game console for the first time in more than 20 years.  It's called  the Atari box, Some of the world's most iconic video games ran of course,  on Atari including Pong, Pac-Man.  Atari filed for bankruptcy in 2013.   They emerged here later as the company focused on mobile and online games  but the company says that Atari box is based on PC technology.  As a kid  always playing Atari -- bring it on back, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Bring back Pac-Man.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm ready for that.</p><p> BAKER:  I put a lot of quarters into the Pong machine -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How cool we are?</p><p> MURPHY:  It's fantastic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Pong, Pac-Man.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  I bought my three little boys Scooter, Slughorn (ph) and  Mugsie (ph).  I bought them an old Atari and they love this thing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BAKER:  And I was worried.  I thought they're going to look at it and go,  \"are you kidding me\".  They loved it.</p><p> MURPHY:  They take the Atari over the iPhone?</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  Come on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not your kids.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not your kids.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your kids are not taking Atari over the iPhone.</p><p> MURPHY:  They need the iPhone 7.  The 6 isn't even good enough.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.  All right.  We'll take a break.</p><p> When we come back, Google takes new measures to combat the rise of  terrorism online.

Tracee -- good morning to you.</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p> Now the parent company of Google says it is working to remove all videos  that violate YouTube's community guidelines such as those promoting  terrorism.  YouTube will increase technology and the number of experts to  flag terrorist-related content and videos that do not meet grounds for  removal but still promote offensive viewpoints will come with a warning and  will not be able to be recommended, endorsed or commented on by users  making them harder to find.  </p><p> YouTube will also use targeted online advertising to reach potential ISIS  recruits and then redirect them towards anti-terrorism videos that can  change their minds about joining.  A spokesperson for Google says quote,  \"There should be no place for terrorist content on our services.\"</p><p> The changes come after reports that one of the suspects in the London  Bridge terror attack became radicalized after watching pro-ISIS videos on  YouTube.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have faced harsh criticism for not  doing enough to remove extremist content from their Web sites.  </p><p> It is a daunting task with, you know, over 400 videos uploaded per minute.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For a long time these companies, YouTube included, were getting  criticized for not doing enough.  Do you see this as enough.</p><p> MURPHY:  Right.  I don't but I don't know what the answer is.  I think  somehow someway extremists are going to figure out a way to get their  message out there.</p><p> I don't know if these companies can actually do enough to stop it, if they  can do anything to stop it because I think the terrorists will get around  it someway.</p><p> BAKER:  This is an advantage.  This is actually a good move.  I agree, it's  not going to solve the problem entirely.  But it is in combination with a  variety of other things including locating, identifying and taking them  out.  This sort of step is also very helpful.</p><p> CARTER:  But I can't help but wonder, I mean with all the big data  advancements and they know who the target audiences are that are on their  sights, what they're interested in so they can serve up advertisement.  How  can they not know what else is going on?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's a good point you make because they've got  all these measurement tools -- </p><p> CARTER:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- to track everything else.  How come they can't track this  better?</p><p> CARTER:  When they could give me an advertisement on what I want why can't  they say, do you want something bad.</p><p> BAKER:  They could.  They could.  But you know what that means.  That means  changing laws.</p><p> MURPHY:  Censorship. </p><p> BAKER:  That's right.  And if they -- </p><p> MURPHY:  You're giving up something for getting something.  I'm not saying  we don't.  I think we should be more aggressive.  But that is a bigger  conversation.</p><p> CARTER:  But giving up a privacy to be told to.  I mean why not for  security.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's all important issues to bring up.</p><p> Tracee -- thank you.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p> Coming up -- Pushing ahead with President Trump's agenda.

Thanks so much  for joining us. </p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 19.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> London on edge once again -- a man ploughs his van into a crowd outside of  a mosque and is in police custody this morning.  Authorities are  investigating the incident as a terrorist attack.</p><p> Meanwhile news questions about the Russia probe -- whether President Trump  is actually under investigation at all despite his recent tweets.</p><p> Technology leaders are descending on the White House today.  The first  meeting of the Technology Advisory Council convenes late this afternoon  focusing on the government's IT system; among those attending Apple's CEO  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Amazon's Jeff Bezos among others.</p><p> While all of this is happening at the White House Congress is focused on  the agenda.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that he wants  healthcare done by the Fourth of July.  Senator Marco Rubio says speed  should not be the priority.  Here's what he told me yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I would rather us do it right than do it  fast because no matter what passes, if it isn't good or it has some  unintended consequence the President is going to be held responsible for  that.  Republicans are going to be held responsible for that.  Let's not  repeat the mistakes the Democrats made.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take a closer look at the legislative agenda coming up.</p><p> Markets are rallying today, kicking off the week strongly -- Dow  Industrials at the highs of the morning right now up to 75 points.  Nasdaq  up almost 40.</p><p> In Europe the indices are also higher across the board; up between half a  percent and 1 percent the CAC 40 up almost 1 percent this morning in Paris. </p><p> In Asia overnight, stocks finished higher there as well.

We've got the highlights of the U.S. Open this morning.</p><p> And Olympic Great, Michael Phelps taking on new competition, get this,  details on his race against the great white shark.  How's that going to  work?  We will tell you about it. </p><p> First, our top story this half hour right now, tragedy strikes London  again, British authorities now saying a suspect has been detained after a  van plowed into a crowd of worshipers near a Mosque in Northern London  early this morning.  According to London police they are treating this as a  possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at the scene though it's  unclear if his death was actually related to the attack.  Ten others were  wounded, the driver, a 48-year-old man arrested at the scene after being  detained by members of the public.  According to some reports witnesses  said that the driver was heard shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.</p><p> Joining me right now is Counsel to the president, Kellyanne Conway.   Kellyanne, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, U.S. PRESIDENT:  It's a pleasure Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  We've got extra security  measures being taken, people are worried.  Do you expect we'll see extra  security measures taken in the U.S. as a result of what went on in London?</p><p> CONWAY:  Well the president and his counterterrorism team assess this  situation throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were  concerned with their British counterparts and since it looks like the  British government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll  wait to see how that investigation unfolds.</p><p> And where we support our allies anyway that they need, we just don't want  this to become the new normal where people feel like they're changing the  behavior, their lifestyles, their lives indeed Maria and allowing the  terrorists in any form to win and to prevail.  And so we know that people  are very concerned about national security, it's in large part how the  president won.  He just frankly put out the more masculine, more robust  antiterrorism program whether it's (inaudible) strength or him wanting ISIS  to be in retreat.  Hillary Clinton referred to them as our, \"determined  enemies\" at her convention speech so I think there's a huge contrast.  And  you're seeing that play out now where the president is constantly talking  about how his first response really to this nation is our safety and  security.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, he really did.  And I think that's why it's just a head  scratch as far as why he gets this pushback on the travel ban and  everything else.</p><p> Meanwhile, there are new questions surrounding whether or not the president  is actually under investigation or not by the Special Counsel looking into  Russia's alleged election meddling.  On Friday the president tweeted out  this, \"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who  told me to fire the FBI Director!  Witch Hunt.\"  And then yesterday, a  member of the president's legal team contradicted the tweet.  Kellyanne, is  the president under investigation?</p><p> CONWAY:  Well I don't think Jay Sekulow, the president (inaudible)  contradicting the tweet, I think he explained it.  What Mr. Sekulow said is  that is that the president is constrained by the 140 characters in Twitter.</p><p> The president uses his social media platform to communicate directly with  the people as you know Maria.  But that Jay Sekulow, his per -- one of his  personal lawyers said the president has not been notified that he's under  investigation.  In fact, Mr. Comey testified that the president is not the  president said in the letter where he dismissed Mr. Comey in May, that  Comey had told him three times that he wasn't under investigation, they've  not been notified otherwise.  His personal lawyer would know this.</p><p> And it's important to say that because what the president was reacting to  in that particular social media message was the Washington Post report that  was based on five anonymous seekers, anonymous sources that must have been  leaked that he's somehow under investigation.  His lawyer is saying no he's  not.  So I think he's explaining that the president is really pointing out  the irony of everything and the last part of his tweet is the most  important which is that he consider this to be a witch hunt.</p><p> We've been doing this for many, many months now having an investigation,  where's the collusion?  Where's the obstruction of justice?  Where's the  evidence that supports this conclusion and we have separate, what, five or  six different separate congressional investigations going on and we've been  doing this for eight to nine months, I mean you could have a baby in this  time and they have no evidence.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well look, I have been very adamant about this as well from the  beginning saying, look, this is a -- it looks like a completely  manufactured story.  Russia has been hacking, it has been undermining the  U.S. and the West for decades, why attach the president to that he has  nothing to do with it?</p><p> However, why respond to the Washington Post do you think Kellyanne?  I mean  the president has rightly so called some of the news out there fake news  and in many cases the president was right, why respond to the Washington  Post?  I mean the idea of tweeting, I understand he's speaking directly to  the American people, people like it and it's been a good strategy for him.   But can you convince him or ask him why he's not tweeting about the agenda?   Why he's not tweeting about other -- why bring up the Russia story and  respond to the Washington Post when this is a news organization he's called  fake news anyway.</p><p> CONWAY:  So here's where everybody has to wake up each morning and make  their own choices.  The media could cover all of his tweets and if they did  that, they would see that he more often tweets about agenda items than  other matters.  </p><p> He has this constant stream on Instagram, on Facebook, on Twitter, his big  social media platform where he says reaches about 100 million people,  Maria.  And you had the entire day in Cuba the other day where he rolled  back these awful rules that Obama put in place that allowed the Cuban  Regime not the Cuban people to benefit financially.  We had the first  meeting at the White House with the Opioid Commission on Friday.  Earlier  in the week the president did workforce development and apprenticeship  week, that's all on Twitter.</p><p> This week he'll be meeting with the -- today he'll be meeting with the tech  CEOs.  Last week he also sign some things into laws and the EOs that  benefit people, benefit workers.  All of that goes on to his Twitter feed  when he has a bilateral.  He's hosted I think more than 20 now with the  White House with foreign leaders but people don't want to cover that, they  want to cover -- they're very selective in the different tweets they want  to cover.  So he -- I'm telling you, the American people see all of the  social media platforms.  They're sort of saying attention saying, \"Wow,  he's going to put all this money and all this force in effect of the White  House behind apprenticeship programs where those who go through at  apprenticeship program the Department of Labor say they get -- they're 90  percent get employed immediately and they make an average of $60,000 per  year.</p><p> So we want to dignify all types of career paths, all types of jobs, the  welders, the hairdressers, the plumbers, the carpenters, people who get a  high school diploma and a skill certificate.  All of that's on the social  media platform, they just don't want to cover it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  I think that's a fair point.  I mean, but there is  criticism that the president brings up things that he doesn't really need  to.  I mean does he create some obstacles for himself by bringing up some  of the things that perhaps the supporters don't believe anyway?</p><p> CONWAY:  Well in this case though he -- first of all, he's the president of  all Americans and he made that clear beginning on November 9th and he's  never wavered from that.  </p><p> People who criticize him and even deny that the legitimacy of his  presidency will benefit from his tax cut, they will benefit from better  healthcare, they will be benefit from infrastructure, they will benefit  from ISIS in retreat, they will benefit from the regulatory framework being  chipped away because it's impeding our pocketbook in a personal liberty  issues.  But Maria, the fact that the president feels he has a right to  defend himself on occasion.</p><p> He's watching a one-sided witch hunt as he refers to it because it's not  like if we're in a court of law and you're watching people -- you're  watching one side and it's a prosecution rest and here comes the defense,  it doesn't work that way.  You got Comey testifying without anybody  responding in front of 20 million people.  You've got outlet after outlet  that's still criticizing him that is against him, that's part of the  \"resistance and obstruction.\"  You got an entire democratic party and their  presidential nominee (inaudible)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about what the president could do but let  me get to this because the president has added John Dowd, a veteran lawyer  in Washington to his legal team.  Is the president preparing for a legal  battle?  Is that why he is upping the number of people on the legal team?   Tell us what he's expecting.</p><p> CONWAY:  Well he's always been a prepared man.  He's a very smart  businessman, among the smartest, most successful.  </p><p> And he's just somebody who surrounds himself with the best and the  brightest and he's doing that here as well.  What he's preparing for is  what we already know exist which is this investigation that's ongoing --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The witch hunt is what he calls it.</p><p> CONWAY:  Witch hunt.  But it continues forward for now and he's just  preparing himself for that.  And I know a number of these attorneys and  they're all very talented and they all have different types of expertise.</p><p> And I think the most important thing is that they understand their client  in this case and that they protect him and they avail him of every possible  resource in him defending himself, he has the right to do that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, I think the left has been really driving this  narrative in terms of the Russia probe from the get-go since the president  took office.  What can the president do to keep the team on focus on the  agenda?  </p><p> I mean, yesterday I had on a number of congressman and they blame the  senate for part of the obstructionist.  I mean we've got a healthcare bill  sitting in the senate, a lot of people want to see tax reform this year.   The president has been vocal about it, he wants a 15 percent corporate tax  rate, he's talked about his white paper that he's come out within that  regard but is there anything that the president can do to ensure that they  get something done, the congress passes legislation this year?  Because  Kellyanne, the truth is is, you could take one issue like the travel ban,  they're pushing back there.  You could take another issue like repealing  and replace ObamaCare, pushing back there.  But the real goal of the left  is to take over the house in 2018 and move to impeach President Trump.  How  does he get ahead of that?</p><p> CONWAY:  Well first of all, he has asked for their votes, we would still  love to have democratic votes on healthcare, on tax reform the way  President George W. Bush had 10 or 12 democratic senators in 2001 Maria to  pass his tax cut.</p><p> The democrats -- the senate was controlled by the democrats when President  George W. Bush passed his tax cut.  So we would love to have democratic  vote on infrastructure and any number of these measures.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It doesn't look like (inaudible) </p><p> CONWAY:  And it doesn't look like they're even interested in governing.   The democrats are interested in politics, the president is interested in  governing and leading and having impact from people's lives.</p><p> So we're always open in getting their votes, where are they?  Why don't  they come to the table and channel some bipartisanship on measures that  affect their constituents as well?  Number two, the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the healthcare  reform.  You know, ObamaCare has been a (inaudible) for over seven years,  the sinking battleships turns slowly and they've got part one through the  House, now the senate will do its work, Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th that's around the corner.  Tax reform later  this year, they're moving towards infrastructure, towards border security,  more of that, the military's got new funding.</p><p> So things are happening and everywhere I go that's what people reflect back  to me, \"Tell the president we see what he's doing, to keep doing it, to not  give up, to knock it in.  We're praying for him, we support him, he's  making the impact on people's lives.\"  So I think the president just has to  have this two front in the one hand keeping an eye on these investigations  that he calls a witch hunt that so far have produced nothing but a waste of  taxpayer dollars --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's expensive.</p><p> CONWAY:  And it's getting really expensive.  We live through this before,  where are the same democrats who complained about previous investigations  that actually did bear fruit where a former president lied under oath and  obstructed justice.  We know what happened there.</p><p> They were -- they complained completely about the waste of taxpayer  dollars, I would up that end up to here.  And then, of course, the  president's main front is passing all this stuff, I work with him every  single day he and his senior team and his cabinet, his vice president  Maria, are forging ahead to create those jobs, to continue to have  confidence in the economy.  You see the small business manufacturing home  builder, consumer confidence numbers, you see the way the markets has  responded to this man's presidency.  He's been there five months tomorrow,  it's only five months.  People feel like things should be going faster and  faster because they know that's Donald Trump's pace.</p><p> But he's up against a Washington that moves much more slowly than he does  but I think the two shall meet.  And there's two paces and there's two ways  of doing business will actually produce -- continue to produce results for  real people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well there's no doubt about it the president has been  incredibly successful in terms of rolling back regulations.  Whatever he  can do in terms of executive orders, without the congress, he's been able  to do and it's been very successful.</p><p> But he does face this goal on the left of just obstructing, stop the  agenda.  Chuck Schumer has been very clear.  They don't -- you're not going  to get democratic support.  I mean do you really think you're going to get  democratic support on tax reform or repeal and replace?  No.</p><p> CONWAY:  I feel like if people watch your show should call the democratic  senators and members of congress and say, \"Get on with it now.  Accept the  election results, stop with the resistance and move on to governing, move  on to leading.\"  </p><p> Because the democratic party is in an odd place right now, they had their  true leader, they're all arguing, they don't know what they're governing  philosophy is accepted, the message now is the message wasn't (inaudible)  Maria which is, \"You're terrible and I'm not you.\"  That's not a message,  that's an insult to anyone (inaudible).  But the democrats are stuck  somewhere between not being able to accept the 2016 election results and  being completely focused in the 2018 election results.</p><p> What about 2017?  What about governing?  What about leading?  What about --  you owe it to your constituents to get things done --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see -- yes.  We'll see if the public responds to the  obstructionism come '18.</p><p> CONWAY:  They were (inaudible) did you see the approval ratings?  Chuck  Schumer, the democrat, Pelosi their approval ratings are all much lower  than the president.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.  All right.  Today, you've got a very  big meeting at the White House with technology CEOs.</p><p> CONWAY:  Yes, very exciting.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The IT of government system is at focus, is that where the  priority is?  What's going to go on at the --  </p><p> CONWAY:  It is indeed.  And President Trump and Jared Kushner, his senior  adviser who runs the Office of American Innovation has been way on top of  this issue from day one.  </p><p> What is it?  We literally have government agencies and cabinets they can't  speak to each other because they have different programs.  And look at what  just happened recently in the last couple of weeks with the Veterans  Affairs Administration, you've got the Department of Defense and Veterans  Affairs literally weren't talking to each other.  So what Jared did is he  invited in the five brightest tech people or five tech experts in DoD, five  from Veterans Affairs and said, \"How can we get this together?\" </p><p> Viola, now we have a system in place where veterans will be treated as one  single patient seamlessly through both of those agencies.  So the idea is  to stop all this waste -- do you realize that LMB just finished with Y2K?   In 2017, do you realize that there are 1,000 different hotlines for  veterans to call the Veterans Affairs?  Do you realize that we spend -- the  average American spends like 30 hours a year on paperwork for the  government?  So we need a government agency that talks to each other and  make it seamless and modernize it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what the goal is today.</p><p> CONWAY:  And we're glad the tech CEOs are coming in to do that.  We know  that they have been incredibly successful, they do this for a living and  we're happy that they're coming to share their best practices with the  president.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Kellyanne, good to see you.</p><p> CONWAY:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kellyanne Conway there.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The death toll from last week's high-rise fire  in London is continuing to rise.  Cheryl Casone with the details now,  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes Maria, we're getting the numbers  unfortunately London police now says 79 people are now dead or missing  following that terrible fire at Grenfell Tower.  That's up from the last  update that we'd received a 58 dead or missing.</p><p> London Mayor Sadiq Khan says the fire was a preventable accident caused by  years of neglect from the government, their siding materials in that  building.  Local officials have come under heavy criticism for not  providing enough support or information.  So the cause of the fire was  (inaudible) 24 storey building does remain under investigation today but  there had been suggestions the new paneling used in a recent renovation may  have helped the flames move quickly at the outside of the building.  Again,  we're following the story for you out of London this morning.</p><p> We're also got (inaudible) at home Lockheed Martin in the final stages  negotiating a huge deal worth more than $37 billion.  The defense  contractor reportedly going to sell a record 440 F35 fighter jets serve  from 11 nations that does include the U.S.  The final price those jets  expected to be around $85 million.</p><p> And finally this is a way to make sure your child flies for free, give  birth onboard the aircraft.  A baby boy was born yesterday on an India Jet  Airways flight between Saudi Arabia to India.  The flight diverted to  Mumbai after a mom went into labor.  Luckily, a trained nurse was onboard,  and crew, and, of course, the passengers as well helped deliver that baby.   The airline has given the little boy Maria a free lifetime pass as a  birthday gift.  He flies for free for life.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Thank you so much Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Brooks Koepka, how about that, swinging into the  history books this weekend with his first major championship.  The winner  of the U.S. Open, we've got all the highlights for a wild end for that  Open, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We have another first time winner of the major  championship in golf to report.  The U.S. Open wrapped up yesterday in  Wisconsin, we were happy to be there last week.  Jared Max with all the  highlights, Jared.</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.  Seven straight major  won by a golfer who never won a major before.</p><p> 27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka did in a record setting fashion.  All  tied up on the scoreboard with just six holes to go, Brian Harman now enter  Sunday lead to get minus 12 but fell apart with a couple of lay bogies on  12 and 13 as he was fall -- he would fall a couple of shots behind.  While  Brooks Koepka would to everything he needed to do.  Late in the tournament,  Koepka had birdies on 14, 15, and 16, eventually we would go to the 18th  hole and Brooks Koepka would manage to get in there for a birdie.  He  finishes at 16-under par, that ties Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest  score in relation to par at a U.S. Open.  Good for a check yesterday of  $2.16 million, that's the largest earning in one day in golf history,  congratulations to the 27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka.  </p><p> Last August, Kyle Larson earned his first career NASCAR victory at Michigan  International Speedway by beating out his friend Chase Elliot.  Yesterday,  Kyle Larson did it again.  In the target car, 15 laps to go at the  (inaudible) 400.  Larson would take advantage of a restart and claim the  lead from Kyle Bush and then with about 10 laps to go, you see Ryan  Blaney's care malfunctions, causes a pileup, Daniel Suarez gets clipped, he  runs in down (inaudible) into the wall.  Final laps though, Kyle Larson  scores his third career win and second of the season and celebrates with  his son on Father's Day.</p><p> All right.  So the Warriors lost the NBA title last year and then they  signed Kevin Durant and then they beat the Cavaliers for the championship  this year.  So now it's the Cavaliers turn to make a splash, right?  Well  according to Yahoo's Vertical, the Cavaliers received a phone call this  weekend from the Indiana Pacers who wanted to know if they might be  interested in making a trade for All Star Paul George who reportedly told  the team he will opt out of his contract in 2018 to become an unrestricted  free agent.  Paul George average nearly 24 points gain for the Pacers and  he is also friends with Lebron James back in April.  Lebron posted this on  Instagram saying, \"Nothing but love and respect.  Love the battle last  night bro.  I'm glad to see you back where you belong\" and includes this  hashtag #youngking because Lebron is king.  So maybe this is the beginning  of a recruiting process, Paul George, what a talented player, he's beaten a  bad injury, his back, so Cleveland would have to give up an arm and a leg  together.</p><p> MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was going to say, who are they  going to give up?</p><p> MAX:  Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love maybe.</p><p> BAKER:  You can't give up Kyrie.  No, no.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Paul George is no Kevin  Durant.  </p><p> MAX:  Correct.  Very few people are.  </p><p>      BAKER:  Do you think Erin Hills is going to take -- that was the first  time they hosted the Open, are they going to take any heat for the  (inaudible)?</p><p>      MAX:  Yes because the scores were way too strong.  We had more I  believe -- there were more scores under par yesterday than -- in this  tournament than we ever have in history as far as U.S. Open, so it wasn't  strong enough.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting if that's the case.  It was a long course,  they walked nine miles versus an average six miles on other course.</p><p> Let me ask you this, you got to explain this story to me, the Olympic  swimmer Michael Phelps has a new rival.  Phelps is going to face off  against El Great White Shark for a reality series on the Discovery Channel.   It's unclear how they're going to be raising against one another but it  will air during the Discovery Channel Shark Week, what do you make of this?</p><p> MAX:  Michael Phelps swims at best six miles per hour, a great white goes  twenty miles per hour.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, what's the point?</p><p> MAX:  So I don't know how -- maybe -- somebody said maybe if Phelps gets a  head start, he starts first and then the shark coming after him maybe he  can get the seven miles an hour.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  (inaudible) the sharks chasing him, let's see how fast he  goes then.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There will be some protective situation where he's in like a  tunnel of some sort.  I don't know, how are they going to do it.</p><p> MAX:  Maybe.  He's going to need a bigger boat.</p><p> LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Swim in a cage.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to watch Discovery Channel for that one.   Jared, thank you.</p><p> MAX:  Thanks Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jared Max.  Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines  24/7 or SiriusXM 115.</p><p> Still ahead, watch out Bill Gates you've got somebody in your heels, Amazon  Founder Jeff Bezos just a few billion shy from becoming the world's richest  man.

Rosecliff  Chief Executive Officer, Mike Murphy is here.  And Diligence President,  Mike Baker.  Good to see you everybody.</p><p> MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Good morning.</p><p> LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Really important conversation today, we're going to talk  about London, a fourth terrorist attack.  And in that meeting at the White  House Mike, I know you want to talk a lot about technology as well.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lot to get to this morning.  And coming up joining the  conversation this morning, the Adviser to President Trump, KellyAnne Conway  is joining us this morning.  So we're going to get into all of the above  with KellyAnne Conway when she joins us, coming up.</p><p> But first, terror strike in London again this morning.  British authority  say that the suspect has been detained as a van plowed into a crowd of  worshipers near a mosque in North London early this morning.  According to  London police, they are treating it as a possible act of terrorism.  One  man found dead at the scene though it is unclear if his death was related  to the attack.  At least 10 others were wounded.  The driver, a 48-year-old  man arrested at the scene after being detained by members of the public.   Video of the moment showed a Caucasian man being detained by police.   According to some reports, witnesses said that the driver was heard  shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.  Mike Baker, what do you make of this  attack?</p><p> BAKER:  Well I think the London authorities are right when they say, \"Look,  you got to condemn extremism no matter what it is.  This is not rocket  science.</p><p> A van drove in to a crowd of Muslims coming out of Mosque, it's Ramadan so  they're coming out, it's about a quarter twenty after midnight and so we  don't have to sit in angst and think too much about what this was all  about.  This is anger welling up from the recent attacks most likely that  had taken place in London whether the concert bombing or London in  Westminster Bridge attacks.  So --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I guess you look at the facts that it's four attacks in just  three months and try to put together the similarities as if it's ISIS  related but this doesn't seem to be that.</p><p> BAKER:  No, this is not.  Again, I don't -- I'm not one to sit and over  think something like this.  We just have to look at it, be pragmatic,  understand what it is and this is a response to what's been happening and  it's wrong and you can't -- what -- people always talk about sort of this  equivalency.  </p><p> \"Oh, if you talk like that or if you do drone campaigns then you lower  yourself to the level of the terrorist.\"  With the drones, I don't think  that's the case, I've never had a problem in operations in counterterrorism  differentiating myself from the bad guys.  But when something like this  happens, it does.  It's on the same level, you're attacking people coming  out their place of worship, you can't do it.</p><p> MURPHY:  I mean it's got to be a really scary time to live in London  because you have so many recent attacks and then there -- I'm sure there  are more people like this looking to respond to those attacks.</p><p> So you look back at all the people that they brought in to London and how  they let them branch off into little areas, pockets of their own  communities and it's got to be a really scary place to live right now.</p><p> BAKER:  Well it's a real divisiveness and you're absolutely right.  To  point out with this whole concept of multiculturalism that has developed  over decades now.</p><p> In the U.K. and now across the E.U. where the idea was, you don't  necessarily -- it was no effort to integrate within the society.  Celebrate  where you came from, celebrate your own culture.  Well that has created  this problem, this is a self inflicted wound to some degree and how they  resolve it, well in the immediate aftermath, they have to do what they're  doing which is Theresa May and all the other leaders have to come out,  condemn it, denounce, show transparency and a quick response just like they  would with any other attack.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But also push this idea that we will clamp down on any  extremism which they haven't done.  As you say, they're allowing people to  live in this no-go areas practice Sharia Law.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  The no-go thing is -- it's complicated, it's not quite the  narrative that has built up over a period of time now where somehow these  are (inaudible) police can't go in there, they go in there, they can go in  there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Even in Paris?</p><p> BAKER:  Yes, even in Paris.  The problem is, it's not so much you have  access to go in there, the problem is developing communication.  And I know  this is going to sound touchy-feely at some 30,000 foot level but I'm  talking from an operational perspective.</p><p> You have to get into this communities, develop some level of trust in  communication in order so that when they see somebody, an immediate family  member, this is the only way you stop some of these folks is that the mom  or the cousin or the brother picks up the phone and has the ability to call  the local authorities.  So the no-go area is more of a tactical operation  which is no communication within these communities.</p><p> CARTER:  Yes.  I do think this is a global issue though.  I mean we're  looking at London and what's happening right now in London.  Paris for a  while was the focus.</p><p> Here we've had -- even here in United States we've had so many issues.   This is global percolating -- percolation as a result I believe of ISIS --  as the result of this attack.  And so I think --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think is okay to do.</p><p> CARTER:  Well exactly.  When I think what -- this would have been an  opportunity for Theresa May I think to really regain confidence and she  hasn't really stepped up into that level.</p><p> And so I think it's really important right now that our world leaders step  up to the table and everybody says, \"Look, we're on the same page here,  let's stop with the blame game, let's just keep moving things forward and  let's start fresh.  There's so many opportunities right now on so many  things that we agree on, enough is enough let's move forward.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  Meanwhile, in Washington today, President  Trump meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White  House.  </p><p> This is the inaugural meeting of what they're calling \"The American  Technology Council.\"  Take a look at some of the leaders that are going to  be present there, the CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos will be there, as well as  Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, Tim Cook from Apple, IBM's Ginni Rommetty  just to name a few.  Mike Murphy, what do you make of this?  This is the  Trump Administration trying to update its IT they say.</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't know how you can find a negative in this.  So Trump feels  like we need to serve the American people better with better technology so  he goes out and he gets the top people from the field of technology in the  world to advise him on it.  So I think -- and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What's wrong with that?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think it's the exact, right way to handle it and I think anybody  who doesn't show up or chooses not to show up is just showing a lack of  openness because you can debate.  </p><p> We can have different views on things but if I'm an expert in a certain  field and you're leading the country, you want to hear from me, you need to  hear from me.  So I think anybody who shows up there, it doesn't mean they  necessarily support President Trump, it means they support the United  States of America and I think it's a great thing that he's doing, I think  it's a great thing all of these people are doing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And to modernize the IT system of the U.S. is exactly what we  need by the way.  We're just looking at pictures of the president and the  first lady coming off of the plane from Camp David, the spent the weekend  in Camp David, Lee Carter.  He tweeted out that it was an honor to be there  as well.</p><p> CARTER:  I think that the American people are really glad to see him doing  these kinds of things.  I think they were -- there's a lot of criticism  spending time at his own property and I think people want to see President  Trump acting presidential doing a lot of the activities that they're used  to and I think there's something comforting about seeing him here.</p><p> I think it's also nice to see Barron in the picture too and enjoying  himself taking selfies being -- it's very, very human.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's being a kid.</p><p> CARTER:  Being a kid, yes.  </p><p> BAKER:  I wouldn't want to be a kid coming off of the Marine1.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I would have taken a selfie.  All right.  Let's talk  about the agenda for a second because senate republicans are working hard  to finalize their bill to replace ObamaCare.</p><p> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he hopes to bring the bill  to the floor within the next two weeks.  Yesterday, I spoke with Senator  Marco Rubio he said the process will likely take a little longer.  Here's  what he told me on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) FLORIDA:  I think healthcare will happen this year,  tax reform we'll see.  We're working on that now, there's a component of it  that I'm working with Ivanka Trump on where there's the pro family  component of it and in fact we'll have a meeting this week with her and a  number of senators and house members to begin to layout that portion of the  agenda.</p><p> But I do think tax reform, these things can work simultaneously.  You don't  have to wait to finish on healthcare before you start formulating ideas on  tax reform and that's happening right now.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well I would expect the questions to really ramp up certainly  this week after what happened last week.  Steve Scalise is still on the  hospital obviously.  His condition was downgraded from a critical to  serious condition.  But do you worry about where the agenda stands now in  terms of tax reform and healthcare reform?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think it seems like as if people after what happened last week,  people want to work together.  So hopefully, this was a bottom as far as  the divisiveness in Washington and now people can come together, put both  sides on the table and reach an agreement.</p><p> BAKER:  What I don't understand and maybe I'm just speaking this average  simpleton, when Marco Rubio says, \"You don't have to wait to start ideas on  tax reform\" why weren't the republicans doing this two years ago?  Why  didn't -- when they had this opportunity and they stepped in, they didn't  open the drawer, pull out their plan and say, \"Here it is, here's our tax  reform\" because that would have been the time to do this and not now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They repeal and replace.</p><p> BAKER:  Right.  I don't understand how Washington works, maybe that's as  simple as that.  I -- it's dysfunctional.</p><p> CARTER:  I think America does that's why Donald Trump is president.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I will say this, there is a feeling the leadership says  continually that they are having meetings on tax reform right now just what  Marco Rubio just said that they are doing this behind the scenes in hopes  of getting this done this year.  Are you still a believer that they're  going to get something done?</p><p> CARTER:  I'm always an optimist and I hope they're going to get something  done.  I would love to see them say, \"We're going to work through the  summer break right now to get it done for the American people\" because  that's what they should do.  They made a promise, they should keep it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Or they will do healthcare before July 4th which seems  incredible or maybe they get something out and then they do tax reform  after the summer, I don't know.  Two weeks.</p><p> CARTER:  It's just two weeks, yes.</p><p> BAKER:  They need the big legislative win.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They do.</p><p> BAKER:  They have to have that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They really do.  We'll take a short break we've got a lot of  conversations on deck this morning.</p><p> Coming up in Colorado, some kids may go back to using a landline.  Why one  group is looking to ban the sale of cell phones for children under 13.</p><p> Then Brooks Koepka wins the U.S. Open, gaining his first ever major  championship victory.  We've got all the highlights from the big open, back  in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A navy jet has shot down a Syrian warplane.   Cheryl Casone with the details now, good morning.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Maria.  Well a U.S.  navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian government warplane after it attacks  Washington best fighters near Raqqa.</p><p> This is according to statement from U.S.-led coalition, the coalition said  in that statement that the shoot down was in accordance with rules of  engagement and a number of (inaudible) fighters were wounded in the attack.   Fox News is reporting the Super Hornet that shot down the jet was based  onboard the USS George H.W. Bush which is currently operating in the  Mediterranean Sea.  </p><p> Meanwhile here at home, Colorado is considering banning preteens from  owning cell phones.  Residents in favor, the campaign say that kids under  13 years of age spend too much time on their phone.  Under proposed law,  cell phone retailers will be required to ask the age of the primary cell  phone user before it's sold, parents would not be allowed to buy phones for  their kids that are under the age of 13.  Retailers would face a $500 fine  if they don't comply with this one.</p><p> And Cars 3 sped, get it, into the number one spot at the box office over  the weekend.  This is the 16th Pixar film to debut at number one.  They  brought in $53.5 million that beat the recording breaking Wonder Woman we  should say over the weekend but she is still a force to reckon with Maria,  that moving topping $570 million worldwide.</p><p> And a big in tournament, Brooks Koepka, the golfer coming out on top at the  U.S. Open this weekend.  He won his first major championship, he finished  16 under matching Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest rating score to par  at a U.S. open.  Koepka now the third American to win the U.S. Open in a  row following Dustin Johnson last year and during the (inaudible) in 2015.   Maria, I watch the show that looks like you had a great time at the U.S.  Open.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is beautiful.  We really did enjoyed.  It was great Cheryl.   Thank you so much.  </p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the -- as U.S. authorities consider expanding a ban  for carryon laptops, airlines are faking the consequences.  How a broader  ban could affect you with the airport, coming up.</p><p> Then one American businessman, $5 billion away from overtaking Bill Gates  as the world's richest person, we'll tell you who it is next, back in a  minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos coming closer to  becoming the world's richest man after the company announced the Whole  Foodss deal on Friday, Amazon shares soared adding nearly $2 billion to  Bezos' net worth.</p><p> According to the Wall Street Journal, one firm says that the bidding for  Whole Foodss may only be getting underway -- just beginning to get  underway.  Joining us right now is Kingsview Asset Management Chief  Investment Officer, Scott Martin.  Scott, good to see you.</p><p> SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Hey  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What an incredible deal.  When we first heard that deal on  Friday, what do you say?  My instinct was, they're taking over the world,  Amazon, I mean it's pretty incredible.  What were your thoughts?</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes.  I was shocked.  I mean Amazon now wants to control your  grocery aisle.  And you know what's interesting Maria too, I think there's  a couple of things going on with this deal, first of all, it's been rumored  and it came together at a very last minute.  </p><p> In fact, Amazon was only supposedly working on this deal for a matter of  weeks which maybe speaks to your point about this just begins the whole  negotiation process with respect to this deal but as far as the grocery  aisle goes, this isn't a great business.  If you look at the grocery in the  last several years, consumers are becoming more discerning, profit margins  are lowering at the grocers.  So what exactly Amazon's going to do to the  grocery aisle and do how you shop for your groceries is going to be  interesting with respect to the big reach they have now with Amazon Prime  and some of the other things they're doing at the company.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean look, people saw the deal, Mike Murphy, and they  thought, \"Wow, this is an incredible combination, they bid up the stocks  but the grocery business not such an easy business, that's number one.  And  number two is this may not be so easy to take it over, the journalist  reporting the Neuberger Berman might be a bidder, that there's a new  process that other bids will come in.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I can see anyone coming into bid against Bezos and Amazon.   They have --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And paying more than $13 billion.</p><p> MURPHY:  Because if you do bid it up, I think Bezos, he obviously wants the  company, he can go in and bid above them, it's going to be hard to compete.   I mean maybe a Walmart could go in and try to compete but I don't really  see that.</p><p> I think Whole Foodss is going to be acquired by Amazon and it's a low  margin business, it's not a great business to be in but I think Bezos is  thinking two or three steps ahead.  I think he's thinking about using all  the Whole Foods stores over 400 stores nationwide as fulfillment centers,  as processing centers, as warehouses.  I think he's seeing all the Whole  Foods customers, the affluent customers as Amazon members.  Remember,  Amazon stock popped on Friday on this news, it went up and increased more  market value than the entire purchase price that they're paying for Whole  Foods.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p> MURPHY:  So I think right now the market's betting on Bezos and thinking  Bezos is going to figure this out.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How about all the other supermarket companies that all sold  off?  I mean everybody was worried it.  You look at Kroger, you look at the  other supermart companies and -- I mean what was that all about?  Do you  think people were just nervous?</p><p> MURPHY:  It was Kroger, it was Walmart, it was all of the supermarket  companies just thinking that Amazon is getting in here now, they're going  to do what they did in e-commerce.  They're going to just crush margins,  they can afford to lose money for a number of years.  So therefore they  could really put a ton of pressure on all the other grocers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> MURPHY:  But I there's potential there because I think there'll be more  consolidation amongst the other place.</p><p> BAKER:  Well Whole Foods been having problems for some time now, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They needed help.</p><p> BAKER:  And I wonder to what degree this might be in part a strategic shot  at Walmart, you mentioned Walmart.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, big -- I mean it's a big part of it.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  Yes.  And remember, an activist hedge funds came in and took  a big stake, almost a 10 percent stake in Whole Foods Jana Partners and  they were putting a lot of pressure on the board to do something, that  definitely had something to do with this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey Scott, jump in here.  What about -- then there's the Yahoo  story as well, end of an era, officially becoming Altaba as it starts  trading under a new name, Yahoo becomes Altaba.  Do you think the company  will be able to turn around now that the Verizon deal is done?</p><p> MARTIN:  You know it's interesting Maria, when you look at Yahoo in the  last say six to twelve months and those shareholders that waited around for  this end of the Marissa Mayer deal even or the era of Marissa Mayer, that  actually got reward to shareholders because that's really one of the other  thing that I think the company is seeing moving forward but I'll tell you  what's interesting as far as Yahoo and ramping this back in the Amazon, i  mean Amazon is taking over the internet too.</p><p> I mean you look at Amazon web services, you look at all the reach that they  have now with their website and their apps, I mean a lot of these companies  that are trying to compete with Amazon whether it is in the grocery aisle,  whether it is online are really losing this battle and as I think what Mike  pointed out, Amazon is willing to go into these markets wherever it is and  lose money just to get consumers and customers just to be beat out the  competition.</p><p> CARTER:  I mean I also think though -- and I'm really curious to what you  think about this, is, is that there was some kind of a status symbol  associated with being able to afford to go to Whole Foods and what -- and I  think there's an opportunity for some of these brands to really step up and  sort of that niche that experience but they are going to have to adopt with  the time.  Do you think that there's any other brand that's going to be  able to comment and take that place?  I'm kind of wondering if the Whole  Foods brand is going to become water down now.</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes.  Well I'm seriously worried about.  And that the curious  part, I mean I'm concerned about this deal from a standpoint of and Mike  brought it up.</p><p> If he turns these into the fulfillment centers and warehouses, then what  happens?  I mean -- because I agree the -- exactly.  The Whole Foods  experience is really good.  You know what happens Maria around in Chicago,  they just have a new one that's by my house, you go there, you shop, you  have a couple of beers in the bar, you maybe watch the game.  I mean that  maybe go away now and I think that's what's interesting about this deal for  Amazon that they're making for Whole Foods, do they want to take away that  experience because to me that's the value of the shopping experience at  Whole Foods.</p><p> BAKER:  Best line I heard over the weekend was Bezos to pay cash for Whole  Foods.  Who pays cash at Whole Foods?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love that.  That's the best joke ever.</p><p> BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Best joke ever.  Go ahead Scott, you want to react?</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes.  I mean -- well you can't afford to pay cash at Whole Foods  that's why I'm a company man because if you don't have enough cash to go in  there that's why the plastic is so good.</p><p> And that's the other thing, Amazon Prime is one of the best let's say  gateway drugs in the planet with respect to what Amazon Prime does for  those who actually ends up going on Amazon and just buying more stuff  because they're Prime members.  It's similar demographic to who does shop  at Whole Foods, so there's some cross over there but how they change them  and how they manipulate that into really big sales is the question that I  have on my mind today but something that Bezos I think is going to answer  in the next couple of years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  Scott real quick, markets  are up today, you put new money to work or no?  Are you pulling back?</p><p> MARTIN:  No, I'm putting money to work Maria.  In fact, I love the tech  sector, they've beaten down the last couple of weeks because of investors  getting nervous.  That's been weak money, I think strong money is going to  come back in here towards the end of the quarter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  You agree with that Mike Murphy?</p><p> MURPHY:  I do completely.  It's opportunity here.  Market, there's a bit  under the markets goes higher.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tough first quarter for tech.  All right.  Scott, good to see  you sir.  Thank you. </p><p> MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, British Prime Minister Theresa May in the spotlight  this morning as formal negotiations for Brexit are underway.  How the  European Union is expected to respond as Britain moves to exit, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: Welcome  back!  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 19th, your top stories right now  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London is on edge, once again this morning.   At least one person has been killed and several others injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in north London; police are treating  this as a terrorist attack.  Meanwhile, Britain also focused on  negotiations for its exit from the European Union; those talks begin today  in Brussels.  We've got a lot at what's at stake.  The possibility of a  laptop ban as airlines scrambling, what it would mean for your trip to the  airport?  </p><p> And markets are rallying this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a  gain of 60 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average today at the open;  NASDAQ, strong by 35.  In Europe, markets are up across the board.  Take a  look at the indices in the Eurozone with the FTSE 100, up one-half of one  percent; and the CAC40 and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  In Asia,  overnight, mostly higher as you see across the board, actually; Nikkei  Average in Japan up two-thirds of a percent; Hang Seng Index and Hong Kong  up better one percent.  </p><p> And the Southwest facing blazing hot triple digit temperatures today,  that's not keeping tourist away though, in fact, they are flocking to Death  Valley.  We will tell you all about it.  Amazon and Wal-Mart on a collision  course for sure now, Wal-Mart announcing its own deal; what the competition  means for the company is coming up.  And the Vice President getting an  extra special Father's Day present; the Pence family welcome two new furry  members: a kitten and a puppy.  All of those stories coming up this  morning.  </p><p> First, our top stories this half an hour: Britain has been rocked by a  tragedy yet again.  London police are investigating a possible terrorist  attack outside of a mosque late last night.  Investigators say that a 40- year-old man rammed a van into a crowd injuring ten people, at least.  One  man was found dead at the scene; it is unclear, however, if that death is  related to this attack.  Prime Minister, Theresa May, is planning to hold  an emergency meeting on the case later today.  </p><p> Joining us right now: the Wall Street Journal U.K. and Brexit Editor,  Stephen Fidler.  Steven, good to have you, thanks so much for joining us.   I want to get to Britain exiting the E.U. in a moment, but first, this is  the fourth major attack in the U.K. since March; what is your reaction?  </p><p> STEPHEN FIDLER, WALL STREET JOURNAL AND BREXIT EDITOR:  Well, I think it's  certainly a surprise than worried people here.  And I think there's an  extra air of uncertainty, not only with these attacks but with the building  fire last Wednesday.  So, London, in particular, I think is feeling this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there a feeling that things need to change in terms of  security?  I mean, how are people feeling in terms of why this is  happening, why London has been under such attack just in the last three  months or so?</p><p> FIDLER:  Well, I think the - I think there is a sense that things need to  change, and there is a question that obviously the security services have  in terms of what they're going to do to deal with people who appear radical  but don't necessarily appear set of violence, you know, what to do to stop  these people going into violence.  So, that's one thing; I think there'll  be a lot of community policing and these kinds of things.  So, I would say,  you know, London has noticed this, but I was down at Borough Market despite  those attacks on London Bridge a week or so ago on Friday, and the place  was just teeming with people.  I mean, it's a - you know, London isn't  shutting down in any sense.  </p><p> LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  I'm curious what the political  environment is like there?  Here in the U.S., people say enough with the  partisanship.  It seems like the U.K. is having a very, very similar  experience right now.  And I'm just curious how people are looking at  Theresa May, and is she going to be able to lead us through this?  </p><p> FIDLER:  I think you hit on something there.  I think there is a lot of  political uncertainty, particularly given what the election result was last  - a couple weeks ago.  In a sense that she expected to come with an  increased majority; we expected to have a stronger government, and in many  ways, we have a weaker one, she doesn't even have a majority in the House  Commons.  And it looks like she's kind of uncertain in handling a lot of  these things.  You know, she hasn't been very adept at adjusting to and  dealing with the crisis as they've come one after the other.  So, I think,  you know, there is the sense of the government is, you know, not reacting  to this very well, and that she, in particular, is struggling to cope with  all of the things on her plate, you know, including the Brexit negotiation  which is starting today.  </p><p> MIKE BAKER, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIVE:  Stephen, you  just something, I think is very important, you just referred to community  policing when you talk about how we try to get ahead of the curve here.  To  what degree do you think the Met Police, or MI-5, or others had had or  having success in developing some line of communication within the Muslim  communities here in the U.K?  </p><p> FIDLER:  I think they've done that.  Obviously, they'll be looking at  what's happened and figure they haven't done it will enough, and it's one  of those things that's come into the political debate here which is whether  the cutbacks that have taken place in terms of government spending since  the financial crisis certainly have reduced the numbers of policemen and  reduced the numbers of police on the streets.  So, that sends at the  political debate with the Labour Party saying, you know, this is a  consequence of the conservative policies that there aren't as many police  on the street as they used to be in, and the community policing that used  to go on five years ago or so, isn't happening to the same degree now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to be watching that.  That's a really  important point to bring up.  Let me switch gears and ask you about talks  officially underway now for Britain to leave the European Union; what are  you expecting here, Stephen, in terms of David Davis-the Brexit Secretary- meeting with the E.U.'s Chief Negotiator in Brussels; that meeting  happening right now.  David said that you're determined to build a strong  partnership.  Listen to this; I want to get your reaction.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DAVID DAVIS, BREXIT SECRETARY:  There's more that unites us than divides  us.  So, while we were ghastly to be, challenging times ahead of us in the  negotiations, we will do all we can to assure that we deliver that works in  the best interest of all citizens.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there are concerns that Prime Minister  Theresa May's government is too fragile when she the majority in the snap  election two weeks ago.  Their growing calls for her to drop her plan of  the hard exit out of the E.U.; what are your thoughts here?  How does this  play out?  </p><p> FIDLER:  Well, it's a - I think a when Theresa May called an election in  April, there was a feeling in Europe, in Brussel that, OK, we're going to  have a stronger leader in the U.K. that can deliver on the promises she  makes in the negotiations.  So, that hasn't happened.  So, I think on the  other side of the, you know, from European Union perspective, there is sort  of, you know, a lot questions about who they're dealing, and whether this  woman is going to be in charge six months from now, and whether they should  make concessions in negotiations with someone who might not be around for a  very long.  </p><p> And on the other hand, as you say, in the U.K., she less able to deliver on  the promises, you know, because the House of Commons is divided, as some of  their own party don't want the kind of hard  Brexit.  And you know, it's  possible that the House of Commons or the House of Lords, which is the  unelected second chamber could overturn a lot of what she's trying to do.   So, I think we're entering these negotiations only 21 months to go before  the U.K. leaves the E.U. in a very uncertain situation.  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF VENTURES FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Stephen,  it's Mike Murphy, I would think of these recent attacks that's in the U.K.  that the people who are going to be voting would want to be more for  Brexit, so that they could kind of control their borders, and maybe be  safer as a group.  Do you see that gaining any momentum kind of the pro- Brexit crowd because of the recent attacks?  </p><p> FIDLER:  I don't see that as a - the opinion polls don't seem to show that.   I mean, there is an element of that in the discussions.  I mean, you know,  even in the European Union, the UK. could - you know, they're always  possible controls from other people coming in for the U.K.  So, it's not  quite true to say the U.K. didn't control these borders.  What it had an  issue with was people coming into, and working in the U.K. from other parts  of the European Union, and the U.K. could say, quote his answer.  So, I  think there's a slightly different questionnaire, and I think from the  other side of the coin is the state of the British economy.  I mean, the  pound fell very sharply after the referendum last year.  Inflation is  starting to feed through, and people are fighting their standard of living  being eroded.  So, maybe that the sorts of an anti-Brexit crowd are kind of  getting a little more growing, somewhat, because of concerns about the  economy.  </p><p> BAKER:  Stephen, Mike Baker here again, do you feel that comment of David  Davis is correct when he said that there's more that unites the U.K. with  U.E. and then divides you?  </p><p> FIDLER:  I think there's a -- there's a sense in both - in which both sides  want a good deal out of this.  I don't think it's in any - nobody thinks  it's in their interest, but this all blows up and that's a sort of a big  break, or at least very few people think that's a - that's a great idea.   So, I think that's true.  I think that the thing that's left unsaid and  really that the U.K. hasn't held its answer is what actually do they  (INAUDIBLE) from this new relationship.  And certainly, some of the things  that they've outlined don't seem to be likely to be agreed on the other  side.  So, I think the - actually, the E.U. said much more about what it's  -- how it's going to approach the negotiations than the U.K. - than the  U.K. has.  There are a lot of unanswered questions about what the U.K.  really is looking for out of all of this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stephen, then new developments in France, newly elected  President, Emanuel Macron consolidating power.  His party obviously winning  a clear majority in parliament overnight what does this victory mean for  the E.U.?</p><p> FIDLER:  It's interesting because it's contrast very much with what's going  on in the U.K., where you have - you have a leadership that is weakened.   Now, we've had this guy coming almost from nowhere in a year, creating a  political movement, becoming the President of France and gaining a huge  majority in the parliament to push through the kind of things that he said  he wants to do, which is including reforming the French slave market.  So,  I think the narrative in which the U.K. went into the sort of referendum  which was a declining European Union and sort of strengthening Britain.   That sort of - that kind of mood music has changed because I think the --  to some extent, anyway, and I wouldn't want to exaggerate this, the E.U.  has got its mojo back partly thanks to, what, some Macron who was a very  pro-E.U. candidate is doing, and also the fact that Angela Merkel looks as  if she's going to come back as chancellor, possibly with, you know,  increased majority or an increased size of her party.</p><p> So, in a sense, you know, it looks like the E.U. is sort of moving forward  to an extent that we didn't expect a year ago.  I mean, Macron's problem is  going to be not in the parliament now.  The question is going to be, what  happens in the streets?  How are they going to react?  The trade unions and  others, how are they going to react to what he's trying to do in the labor  market and to reform the economy?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's an important point, and that obviously becomes  clearer over the months and days to come.  Stephen, great to get your  insights.  Thanks so much.  Stephen Fidler joining us this morning in  London.</p><p> FIDLER:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Boeing takes flight with a new plane.  How the  jetliner could rub up competition against rival, Airbus.  Stock has been on  fire of Boeing.  Then, Vice President Mike Pence ads some four-legged  friends to his family.  Their cute new pet social media debut, straight  ahead.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher this morning.  Take a  look at Futures indicating a pretty good rally at the opening of trading.   68 points higher on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  We're watching a  couple of names for you.  Boeing unveiled its first new jet in four years.   The company will develop a bigger 737.  Boeing says 10 customers have  already committed to buying that plane.  The announcement coming at the  Paris air show as the jetmaker looks to take on rising competition from  Airbus.</p><p> We are watching the banks this morning, including JPMorgan Chase.  The  Federal Reserve is set to release the latest result of the stress test  beginning Thursday this week.  Investors are hoping that the banks will get  approval to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends.  And U.S.  Airlines gearing up for the possibility of an expanded ban of carryon  laptops.  Cheryl Casone on that detail right now.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria, we were thinking  that we might get news like this.  So, that initial ban that was put into  effect in May by the U.S. and the U.K. did affect some flights from the  Middle East and North Africa.  A ban now under consideration by the Trump  administration would involve flights originating for as many as 71 airports  around the world.  Big expansion.  That would mean additional security  checks and most likely a lot of angry international customers.  </p><p> Well, we're watching an extreme heat wave happening right now as out in the  southwest, parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah all really  suffering.  Temperatures expected to climb well above 110 degrees this week  in several parts of that region.  Death Valley, that's the hottest place in  America could see, get this, 124 degrees tomorrow.  And we are told that  some tourists actually finding to go there to experience Death Valley in  124 degrees.  No, not a smart idea.  </p><p> All right.  Another headlines this morning.  Good God.  Wal-Mart is going  shopping for an online retailer.  The company - this actually went down on  Friday, Maria, is buying Bonobos, they sell men's clothing for $310 million  in cash.  Now, this deal coming as Wal-Mart takes on Amazon for the future  of retail, and of course, it's on the same date that Amazon announced the  big deal, of course, to buy whole foods.  Wal-Mart has been moving  aggressively to try and transform himself into a major e-commerce power.   They bought jet.com last year for more than $3 billion (AUDIO GAP) today as  you could see on your chart under pressure, though, this morning.</p><p> And then, Vice President Mike Pence celebrated Father's Day by adding two  new members to the family.  The Pences welcomed a new kitten and dog into  their home.  The V.P.'s daughter, Charlotte, posted pictures of the new  addition, Charlie and Hazel.  They replaced the Pence's beagle, Maverick,  who died shortly before for the election.  And then (INAUDIBLE) of a cat,  Oreo, who passed away earlier this month.  They joined Pickles, another  family cat, by the way.  And they also have a bunny, Maria, named Marilyn  Van Dough.  They love (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Marilyn, Hazel, Pickles.  I love it.  I love it. </p><p> CARTER:  I always trust people who - I always trust people who love animals  more than those that's -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Me, too.  That's great.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are on this story, ladies and gentlemen.  For all  new Mike Pence pet news, you (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of pets.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  fighting crime and making a return on your investment at the same time.   Why superhero comic books are trending at the auction block.  We'll tell  you about it, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  May 2017 was a win for comic books with $48.2  million worth of merchandise ordered.  This after comic book sales had a  20-year sales record last August who was (INAUDIBLE) by the success of both  the Marvel and D.C. Film Universes.  Joining me right now is  ComicConnect.com COO, Vincent Zurzolo.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much  for being here.</p><p> VINCENT ZURZOLO, COMICCONNECT.COM CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, your auction of nearly 18,000 comics just closed last  night.  How did it go?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  We had a record week last week.  Closed from Monday through  Friday last week, and preauction estimated were $4 to $5 million.  We broke  $7 million on the auction.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Yes.  We can make the -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think is behind this obsession with comic books  that we have.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Well, I think people are very nostalgic and they're trying to  recapture the happiest times of their life, their childhood.  But I also  think it has a lot to do with the - that comic books have become  commodities.  They are all encapsulated in hard plastic holders from CGC  grading company which is the world's largest grading company.  And they are  encapsulated in these comic book holders, and it makes people who don't  know how to grade a comic book makes them able to buy and sell comic books.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because actually we're looking - I  was thinking, yes, there is that, that we want to relive our childhood, and  I'm thinking, \"Well, that's really wholesome, right?\"  But some comics are  not wholesome.  I've seen a lot of comics.  My husband likes comic books.   And some of these comic books get serious.  I mean, it's not so wholesome.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Well, they're not all for little kids.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Exactly.  Like my husband.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  You know, so there are - there you go.  Exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what is the attraction, do you think?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  So, I think it's nostalgia, I think it's this idea that you -  it's a form of entertainment, it's escapism, it's a form of investing.   People are not so in love with - I think nowadays ever since the recession,  traditional forms of investment.  They have to have - become their own type  of investor.  So, they look at things they love, tangible assets like  vintage comic books.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And one of them that you brought in was the comic in which  Superman appears for the second time.  Let's look at that one here.  How  much does that one go for at all?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  This comic book, the second cover appearance of Superman went for  $188,000.  What's important about this is, this is the court case copy.   This was used when D.C. Comics sued Fox who had made an intimation Superman  back in the 40s, 30s and 40s.  And -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's show that one.  That's this one right here.  Yes.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Because if you the stamp, the court case stamp.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So this is the court case stamp.  Wow.  Because they made a  Superman -</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Yes, Wonderman who was kind of a rip off from Superman.  But this  is the comic book that sold for the most in our auction is the first  appearance of Superman in action comics number one.  Now, my company holds  records, world record.  We sold the first million-dollar comic book, 1.5,  2.2, and over 3 million.  This copy is conserved.  It has a little bit of  conservation done to it to maintain the structural integrity.  This comic  book, we estimated to sell for about $200 to $250,000, sold for $393,000.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  What -- now what does a collector do with that?   Just keep it covered and it's just - that's the price.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  I think it's in their safe or something like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  $300,000 for a comic?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  $393,000.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Almost 400 grand for this cover.  Batman, a  significant character in D.C. Comics.  Why did that one bring in such a  large amount of money?  Tell us about the Batman.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  So, Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman.  This  comic book is actually restored.  If it wasn't restored, it would sell for  over a million dollars easy.  This comic we estimated to sell for about 200  to 250.  It sold for $313,000.  People love Batman, they love Superman.   These are two of the biggest characters in the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  But what about characters today?  Are there new  characters that have emerged today that perhaps could command these kinds  of numbers? </p><p> ZURZOLO:  You know, there's a comic book that came out.  You might have  heard of it, The Walking Dead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Well, it's a huge T.V. show.  Walking dead is huge.  That's  comic book in perfect condition.  The number one copy can sell for over  $3,000, which is really exciting.  Our company will be bringing the world's  best collection of Walking Dead to auction later this year to coincide with  New York Comic-Con as well as an original art collection that's going to  blow the minds of many people around the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And how do you choose something like that, Walking Dead.  Why  did you think Walking Dead would be a good thing?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  I never did.  You know, it's not my market.  But I started  reading them and a comic book done in black and white that was done so  effectively.  It was just amazing.  When you read the original comic book,  you understand why it's become a worldwide phenomenon.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fascinating.  Vincent, great to have you.  Thanks so much for  walking us through it.  </p><p> ZURZOLO:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Vincent Zurzolo there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  Congressman Steve Scalise's condition has improved.  He is upgraded from  critical to serious, just coming after he was shoot last week during  baseball practice with other Republican lawmakers.  The details next hour.   MORNINGS WITH MARIA back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th.  Here are  your top stories 7 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> Breaking news this morning.  London on edge again.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p>In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p>BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p>BAKER:  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p>They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p>A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p>Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p>And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p>So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p>And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p>Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p>Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p>And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p>BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p>BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p>I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p>CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p>MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p>KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p>BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p>KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p>KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p>KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p>Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.  What we know about the attacker this morning.   Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.  </p><p>Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues.  The  Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire  Whole Foods.  The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning!  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p>And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.  Brooks Koepka,  making a name for himself at U.S. Open.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Koepka, a major champion </p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The impact on one of his main sponsors; we'll take a look at  the shares of Nike coming up.  Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p>WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p>PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p>But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p>PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na[ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p>MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p>BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p>PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p>We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p>MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p>BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p>And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p>CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p>CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday June 19.</p><p>Here are your top stories 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning: London on edge again.  At least one person has  been killed, several others injured after a man plowed his van into a crowd  near a mosque in northern London.  British Prime Minister Theresa May  addressing the attack moments ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  This morning, our country woke to  news of another terrorist attack on the streets of our capital city; the  second this month and every bit as sickening as those which have come  before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to London straight ahead to get the  latest there.</p><p>Meanwhile, YouTube taking steps to combat extremism.

And joining me to talk all about  it: the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter is here; the CEO of  Rosecliff Mike Murphy is here; and the president of Diligence Mike Baker is  here.  Great to see you.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot on deck today.</p><p>BAKER:  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Sure is.  Some great guests, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got important guests coming up to talk about what's  going on in London.  We're going to take you live to London momentarily.</p><p>The story out of the White House this morning in terms of technology and  Mike these markets are looking firmer.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Firm, new highs and I think there is a bit  underneath the market.  A lot of negatives out there but the market, as  they say, finds a wall of worry and that's what we're getting right now --  earnings supporting higher prices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning: the counselor to  President Trump Kellyanne Conway is here -- don't miss that.  She's coming  up this hour.</p><p>First though new questions surrounding whether President Trump is actually  under investigation or not by the special counsel looking into Russia's  alleged election meddling.</p><p>On Friday the President tweeted this.  \"I'm being investigated for firing  the FBI director by the man who told me to fired the FBI director.  Witch  hunt.\"</p><p>But yesterday a member of the President's legal team contradicted that  tweet.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, MEMBER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM:  The President has not  been notified by anyone that he is under investigation.  That tweet, Chris  was in response to the \"Washington Post\" story that alleged that five  unnamed sources, anonymous sources linked to the \"Washington Post\" that the  President was in fact under investigation.  So that tweet was in response  to that.  </p><p>There has been no notification of any investigation.  Nothing has changed  since James Comey said the President was not a target or a subject of  investigation.  Nothing's changed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst right now,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- good to see.  Good morning.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on all of this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I think it's a little bit in the weeds because if you  have the former FBI director making a case for attempted obstruction of  justice or even bribery against the President of the United States and  making it in a fairly forceful way.  Whatever you think of him as an FBI  director, that is certainly enough to trigger an investigation.</p><p>So I think both sides are right.  I think that the President is being  investigated but he is not a target.  A target means they plan to bring  charges against you.  So when Jay Sekulow says he hasn't gotten a target  letter that it's probably technically true but it doesn't mean that he's  not been investigated.</p><p>State differently the FBI must investigate allegations of the nature and  quality that James Comey alleged in that senate testimony that he gave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I don't know why the President feels the need to respond  to something like a \"Washington Post\" report.  He calls them fake news  anyway.  So why respond?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he has had tremendous success in energizing  his base -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  I know.  I get that.  I get that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- with his tweets.  No human being in the modern era has had  the success that he has in communicating with his supporters and bypassing  the media.</p><p>But this is a dangerous area for him because we now see federal judges  taking literally Sean Spicer's statement.  The President's tweets official  government communications and federal judges using statements made in the  tweets to undermine oral arguments that his Justice Department is making in  court.</p><p>So he at times while undermining the base may be working at cross purposes  with what his Justice Department is trying to persuade federal judges.</p><p>BAKER:  This may not be a fair question, Judge but what is your gut  feeling?  Where is this going?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know.  I wish I did.  I don't know where it's going  but I do believe that -- as I just said to all of you -- the allegations  that James Comey made were said with such credibility and confidence that  they can't be ignored and they will investigated.</p><p>Now, here is a good side of this.  Sometimes the FBI in the early stages  before you are a subject down here, before you're a target up here you are  sort of in the mix.  They may want to exclude certain people from becoming  subjects and targets and in order to do that they have to conduct an  investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I think we should start looking at where the real  obstructionism has been in that where we know it was.  Senate Republicans  are now turning their attention and their investigative eyes to former  attorney general Loretta Lynch.  Some are saying that they want her to  testify after alarming accusations by the former director, Jim Comey, in  his recent congressional testimony.</p><p>Here is one thing he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  At one point the Attorney General had  directed me not to call it an \"investigation\" but instead to call it a  \"matter\" which confused me and concerned me.  But that was one of the  bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the  department if we are going to close this case credible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was one of three things people are talking about in  terms of why Loretta Lynch needs to be investigated.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Number one, the matter versus investigation.  Number two, the  tarmac meeting -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- two days before Hillary Clinton was to testify, she met with  her husband President Clinton on the plane.</p><p>And number three, apparently there is a memo floating around that has not  been widely disseminated but basically says -- suggests that Loretta Lynch  I will be getting involved.  I'll make sure the FBI investigation of  Clinton doesn't go too far.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Now, we don't know if this memo exists.  But the reports on  the memo are the recipient of it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- the then chair of the Democratic National Committee.  Now  this was back before the DNC, when Bernie Sanders' candidacy was still  alive and Mrs. Clinton had not yet been exonerated by Jim Comey.  Just as I  said that Comey painted enough of a serious case against the President to  warrant investigation by the special prosecutor.</p><p>He clearly painted enough of a case against Loretta Lynch to be  investigated by not the senate judiciary committee but the same FBI, the  regular FBI, the Justice Department -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and not the special prosecutor.</p><p>Now, it is odd and has only happened in rare instances that an attorney  general investigates his predecessor.  It happened, of course when John  Mitchell, Richard Nixon's Attorney General was prosecuted and convicted and  went to jail.  </p><p>But I am telling you there are enough allegations stated in a credible way,  supported by other forensic evidence like we saw pictures of her with Bill  Clinton -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- to warrant a criminal investigation of Mrs. Lynch for  misconduct in office.  Did she use the Justice Department as a political  instrument to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not to mention all of the spying that went on and the  unmasking.  Then there's that.  I am just throwing this out there because  there is a fair amount of things out there to investigate -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- at this point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  but remember, this is not Bob Mueller.  This is Jeff Sessions  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and whoever is running.  It is still Andrew McCabe because  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- Christopher Wray has not yet been confirmed.  It is the  regular DOJ that should be investigating her.</p><p>BAKER:  What I worry and this is what happens in Washington it seems like  all the time which is all these various issues now get molded together, the  public becomes utterly confused over where we're going with this.  And  eventually it all goes away and dies.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now it gives the impression of either scandal or  instability, neither of which is good to give that impression coming from  the Justice Department which is supposed to be relatively neutral -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- doing the right thing, enforcing the rule of law devoid of  politics and above the fray.  It doesn't seem to be that way right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I brought up the memo because there is also  speculation that is totally fake -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- I mean does it exist or not.  We don't know.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  We do know that the \"matter\" thing is true because -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The \"matter\" is true.  He testified under oath.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You'll get a peek at this because Mike -- you live in this  environment.  FBI agents were poking the director in the ribs saying,  you're now the director of the federal bureau of matters.  It's a criminal  investigation -- where is this \"matter\" nonsense coming from? </p><p>BAKER:  We've got to change the logo.  It's going to cost money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. Let's talk about a case that has really rocked  Hollywood and that is, of course, Bill Cosby; a shocking outcome to the  Bill Cosby sexual assault trial yesterday.  The judge declared a mistrial  after the jury was deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberation.</p><p>Judge -- what does this mean for the case against the comedian?  Walk us  through what a mistrial looks like.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  A judge must determine that no further deliberation time is  likely to change anybody's opinion.  Now we don't know if it's 11 to 1 or 6  to 6 or some combination.  Obviously you need unanimity for a conviction  and unanimity for acquittal.  And they didn't have unanimity.</p><p>Some judges will just ask the jury foreman, can you tell me Madam Foreman,  whether or not in your opinion any further deliberation will help.  Some  judges -- this is what I used to do were asked each individual juror.   Don't tell me how you're voting.  That's none of my business.  I want to  know if you still have an open mind or if you are steadfast and nothing  else will change that opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And once the judge comes to that conclusion well then it's  simply a waste of time.  The prosecutors have announced that they will  retry him probably in the fall or the winter.</p><p>This is a very, very strange case because he received a promise, Bill  Cosby, from a prosecutor don't worry you're not going to be prosecuted you  can give a deposition into what happened.  He gave the deposition, the  prosecutor died.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The new prosecutor can -- the judge said, the promise is only  good for as long as he's the prosecutor.  So they can use your own words  against you.  That's called a built-in appeal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is extraordinary.  That's incredible.  </p><p>Judge -- thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great insights as always from you.  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>The U.K. authorities are now investigating that van attack near the London  mosque early this morning as a possible terrorist attack.  </p><p>Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is on the ground in  London right now with the very latest.  Benjamin -- good morning to you.</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you  from London.  Well, yet another attack hitting London over here but, of  course, what it so s strikingly different in this case is that this was an  attack on Muslims.  Of course, we have seen vehicles being used time and  time again.  But not like this.</p><p>And as you said, this is now being treated as an act of terrorism and  investigated by the counter terrorism unit.  It happened just after  midnight here in Finchley, north London outside a Muslim center.  At a time  when the neighborhood was crowded with Muslims finishing Ramadan prayers.   It seems that the attacker knew when prayers ended and he was waiting.</p><p>Muslim leaders have now called it a hate crime and they've asked the public  to stay calm and try to avoid divisions within the community.</p><p>Police have arrested the driver.  He's a 48-year-old white man.    He was  grappled to the ground by two bystanders until the police could arrive.   Those two men are being called heroes.</p><p>Eyewitnesses have also reported that he said a number of times \"I've done  my bit\" and \"I want to kill Muslims.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He did what he did deliberately to hit and kill as many  Muslims as possible.  So he is a terrorist.  So at this stage we are  calling for calm.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HALL:  And the video has also emerged showing the attacker apparently  blowing a kiss from the police van that he was been taken away.  He's been  taken to the hospital.  He's going to be charged when he is let out of  there.</p><p>But a lot of people are saying this is exactly what ISIS wanted.   (inaudible) the narrative.  It helps to create even greater divisions.  And  so right here where we are now in London very much on edge.  It's a very  multi-ethnic, very diverse neighborhood and the police really are just  trying to keep it safe, keep it under control.  The Prime Minister coming  out as well and saying this was not only an attack on this community.  It  was an attack on the whole of the country.  Back to you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.

That collision happened early Saturday  morning as many of the crew slept.  Secretary Sean Stackley praised the  crewmembers for saving the USS Fitzgerald from further damage and bringing  it back into part.  And of course, the sad story is they find those  sailors.</p><p>Representative Steve Scalise's condition, we should say, has now been  upgraded to serious from critical.  According to Medstar Washington  Hospital Center, the congressman had more surgery over the weekend but he  does continue to show signs of improvement.  </p><p>And Scalise did not let his health crisis get in the way of father's day.   He said on the father's day message on twitter, saying quote, \"Steve's  greatest joy is being a father to Madison and Harrison and a husband to  Jennifer.  This father for the Scalise family and they send their best  wishes to every family especially the dads.  Take the time to be close to  the ones that you love.</p><p>Of course Scalise, one of five people wounded last week when a gunman  opened fire on Republicans at a baseball practice in suburban, Virginia.</p><p>Well, tomorrow's special election in Georgia.

The company says it's making a  video game console for the first time in more than 20 years.  It's called  the Atari box, Some of the world's most iconic video games ran of course,  on Atari including Pong, Pac-Man.  Atari filed for bankruptcy in 2013.   They emerged here later as the company focused on mobile and online games  but the company says that Atari box is based on PC technology.

Tracee -- good morning to you.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>Now the parent company of Google says it is working to remove all videos  that violate YouTube's community guidelines such as those promoting  terrorism.  YouTube will increase technology and the number of experts to  flag terrorist-related content and videos that do not meet grounds for  removal but still promote offensive viewpoints will come with a warning and  will not be able to be recommended, endorsed or commented on by users  making them harder to find.  </p><p>YouTube will also use targeted online advertising to reach potential ISIS  recruits and then redirect them towards anti-terrorism videos that can  change their minds about joining.  A spokesperson for Google says quote,  \"There should be no place for terrorist content on our services.\"</p><p>The changes come after reports that one of the suspects in the London  Bridge terror attack became radicalized after watching pro-ISIS videos on  YouTube.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have faced harsh criticism for not  doing enough to remove extremist content from their Web sites.  </p><p>It is a daunting task with, you know, over 400 videos uploaded per minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For a long time these companies, YouTube included, were getting  criticized for not doing enough.  Do you see this as enough.</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  I don't but I don't know what the answer is.  I think  somehow someway extremists are going to figure out a way to get their  message out there.</p><p>I don't know if these companies can actually do enough to stop it, if they  can do anything to stop it because I think the terrorists will get around  it someway.</p><p>BAKER:  This is an advantage.  This is actually a good move.  I agree, it's  not going to solve the problem entirely.  But it is in combination with a  variety of other things including locating, identifying and taking them  out.  This sort of step is also very helpful.</p><p>CARTER:  But I can't help but wonder, I mean with all the big data  advancements and they know who the target audiences are that are on their  sights, what they're interested in so they can serve up advertisement.  How  can they not know what else is going on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's a good point you make because they've got  all these measurement tools -- </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to track everything else.  How come they can't track this  better?</p><p>CARTER:  When they could give me an advertisement on what I want why can't  they say, do you want something bad.</p><p>BAKER:  They could.  They could.  But you know what that means.  That means  changing laws.</p><p>MURPHY:  Censorship. </p><p>BAKER:  That's right.  And if they -- </p><p>MURPHY:  You're giving up something for getting something.

How's that going to  work?  We will tell you about it. </p><p>First, our top story this half hour right now, tragedy strikes London  again, British authorities now saying a suspect has been detained after a  van plowed into a crowd of worshipers near a Mosque in Northern London  early this morning.  According to London police they are treating this as a  possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at the scene though it's  unclear if his death was actually related to the attack.  Ten others were  wounded, the driver, a 48-year-old man arrested at the scene after being  detained by members of the public.  According to some reports witnesses  said that the driver was heard shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.</p><p>Joining me right now is Counsel to the president, Kellyanne Conway.   Kellyanne, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, U.S. PRESIDENT:  It's a pleasure Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  We've got extra security  measures being taken, people are worried.  Do you expect we'll see extra  security measures taken in the U.S. as a result of what went on in London?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well the president and his counterterrorism team assess this  situation throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were  concerned with their British counterparts and since it looks like the  British government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll  wait to see how that investigation unfolds.</p><p>And where we support our allies anyway that they need, we just don't want  this to become the new normal where people feel like they're changing the  behavior, their lifestyles, their lives indeed Maria and allowing the  terrorists in any form to win and to prevail.  And so we know that people  are very concerned about national security, it's in large part how the  president won.  He just frankly put out the more masculine, more robust  antiterrorism program whether it's (inaudible) strength or him wanting ISIS  to be in retreat.  Hillary Clinton referred to them as our, \"determined  enemies\" at her convention speech so I think there's a huge contrast.  And  you're seeing that play out now where the president is constantly talking  about how his first response really to this nation is our safety and  security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he really did.  And I think that's why it's just a head  scratch as far as why he gets this pushback on the travel ban and  everything else.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are new questions surrounding whether or not the president  is actually under investigation or not by the Special Counsel looking into  Russia's alleged election meddling.  On Friday the president tweeted out  this, \"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who  told me to fire the FBI Director!  Witch Hunt.\"  And then yesterday, a  member of the president's legal team contradicted the tweet.  Kellyanne, is  the president under investigation?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well I don't think Jay Sekulow, the president (inaudible)  contradicting the tweet, I think he explained it.  What Mr. Sekulow said is  that is that the president is constrained by the 140 characters in Twitter.</p><p>The president uses his social media platform to communicate directly with  the people as you know Maria.  But that Jay Sekulow, his per -- one of his  personal lawyers said the president has not been notified that he's under  investigation.  In fact, Mr. Comey testified that the president is not the  president said in the letter where he dismissed Mr. Comey in May, that  Comey had told him three times that he wasn't under investigation, they've  not been notified otherwise.  His personal lawyer would know this.</p><p>And it's important to say that because what the president was reacting to  in that particular social media message was the Washington Post report that  was based on five anonymous seekers, anonymous sources that must have been  leaked that he's somehow under investigation.  His lawyer is saying no he's  not.  So I think he's explaining that the president is really pointing out  the irony of everything and the last part of his tweet is the most  important which is that he consider this to be a witch hunt.</p><p>We've been doing this for many, many months now having an investigation,  where's the collusion?  Where's the obstruction of justice?  Where's the  evidence that supports this conclusion and we have separate, what, five or  six different separate congressional investigations going on and we've been  doing this for eight to nine months, I mean you could have a baby in this  time and they have no evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, I have been very adamant about this as well from the  beginning saying, look, this is a -- it looks like a completely  manufactured story.  Russia has been hacking, it has been undermining the  U.S. and the West for decades, why attach the president to that he has  nothing to do with it?</p><p>However, why respond to the Washington Post do you think Kellyanne?  I mean  the president has rightly so called some of the news out there fake news  and in many cases the president was right, why respond to the Washington  Post?  I mean the idea of tweeting, I understand he's speaking directly to  the American people, people like it and it's been a good strategy for him.   But can you convince him or ask him why he's not tweeting about the agenda?   Why he's not tweeting about other -- why bring up the Russia story and  respond to the Washington Post when this is a news organization he's called  fake news anyway.</p><p>CONWAY:  So here's where everybody has to wake up each morning and make  their own choices.  The media could cover all of his tweets and if they did  that, they would see that he more often tweets about agenda items than  other matters.  </p><p>He has this constant stream on Instagram, on Facebook, on Twitter, his big  social media platform where he says reaches about 100 million people,  Maria.  And you had the entire day in Cuba the other day where he rolled  back these awful rules that Obama put in place that allowed the Cuban  Regime not the Cuban people to benefit financially.  We had the first  meeting at the White House with the Opioid Commission on Friday.  Earlier  in the week the president did workforce development and apprenticeship  week, that's all on Twitter.</p><p>This week he'll be meeting with the -- today he'll be meeting with the tech  CEOs.  Last week he also sign some things into laws and the EOs that  benefit people, benefit workers.  All of that goes on to his Twitter feed  when he has a bilateral.  He's hosted I think more than 20 now with the  White House with foreign leaders but people don't want to cover that, they  want to cover -- they're very selective in the different tweets they want  to cover.  So he -- I'm telling you, the American people see all of the  social media platforms.  They're sort of saying attention saying, \"Wow,  he's going to put all this money and all this force in effect of the White  House behind apprenticeship programs where those who go through at  apprenticeship program the Department of Labor say they get -- they're 90  percent get employed immediately and they make an average of $60,000 per  year.</p><p>So we want to dignify all types of career paths, all types of jobs, the  welders, the hairdressers, the plumbers, the carpenters, people who get a  high school diploma and a skill certificate.  All of that's on the social  media platform, they just don't want to cover it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I think that's a fair point.  I mean, but there is  criticism that the president brings up things that he doesn't really need  to.  I mean does he create some obstacles for himself by bringing up some  of the things that perhaps the supporters don't believe anyway?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well in this case though he -- first of all, he's the president of  all Americans and he made that clear beginning on November 9th and he's  never wavered from that.  </p><p>People who criticize him and even deny that the legitimacy of his  presidency will benefit from his tax cut, they will benefit from better  healthcare, they will be benefit from infrastructure, they will benefit  from ISIS in retreat, they will benefit from the regulatory framework being  chipped away because it's impeding our pocketbook in a personal liberty  issues.  But Maria, the fact that the president feels he has a right to  defend himself on occasion.</p><p>He's watching a one-sided witch hunt as he refers to it because it's not  like if we're in a court of law and you're watching people -- you're  watching one side and it's a prosecution rest and here comes the defense,  it doesn't work that way.  You got Comey testifying without anybody  responding in front of 20 million people.  You've got outlet after outlet  that's still criticizing him that is against him, that's part of the  \"resistance and obstruction.\"  You got an entire democratic party and their  presidential nominee (inaudible)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about what the president could do but let  me get to this because the president has added John Dowd, a veteran lawyer  in Washington to his legal team.  Is the president preparing for a legal  battle?  Is that why he is upping the number of people on the legal team?   Tell us what he's expecting.</p><p>CONWAY:  Well he's always been a prepared man.  He's a very smart  businessman, among the smartest, most successful.  </p><p>And he's just somebody who surrounds himself with the best and the  brightest and he's doing that here as well.  What he's preparing for is  what we already know exist which is this investigation that's ongoing --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The witch hunt is what he calls it.</p><p>CONWAY:  Witch hunt.  But it continues forward for now and he's just  preparing himself for that.  And I know a number of these attorneys and  they're all very talented and they all have different types of expertise.</p><p>And I think the most important thing is that they understand their client  in this case and that they protect him and they avail him of every possible  resource in him defending himself, he has the right to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I think the left has been really driving this  narrative in terms of the Russia probe from the get-go since the president  took office.  What can the president do to keep the team on focus on the  agenda?  </p><p>I mean, yesterday I had on a number of congressman and they blame the  senate for part of the obstructionist.  I mean we've got a healthcare bill  sitting in the senate, a lot of people want to see tax reform this year.   The president has been vocal about it, he wants a 15 percent corporate tax  rate, he's talked about his white paper that he's come out within that  regard but is there anything that the president can do to ensure that they  get something done, the congress passes legislation this year?  Because  Kellyanne, the truth is is, you could take one issue like the travel ban,  they're pushing back there.  You could take another issue like repealing  and replace ObamaCare, pushing back there.  But the real goal of the left  is to take over the house in 2018 and move to impeach President Trump.  How  does he get ahead of that?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well first of all, he has asked for their votes, we would still  love to have democratic votes on healthcare, on tax reform the way  President George W. Bush had 10 or 12 democratic senators in 2001 Maria to  pass his tax cut.</p><p>The democrats -- the senate was controlled by the democrats when President  George W. Bush passed his tax cut.  So we would love to have democratic  vote on infrastructure and any number of these measures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't look like (inaudible) </p><p>CONWAY:  And it doesn't look like they're even interested in governing.   The democrats are interested in politics, the president is interested in  governing and leading and having impact from people's lives.</p><p>So we're always open in getting their votes, where are they?  Why don't  they come to the table and channel some bipartisanship on measures that  affect their constituents as well?  Number two, the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the healthcare  reform.  You know, ObamaCare has been a (inaudible) for over seven years,  the sinking battleships turns slowly and they've got part one through the  House, now the senate will do its work, Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th that's around the corner.  Tax reform later  this year, they're moving towards infrastructure, towards border security,  more of that, the military's got new funding.</p><p>So things are happening and everywhere I go that's what people reflect back  to me, \"Tell the president we see what he's doing, to keep doing it, to not  give up, to knock it in.  We're praying for him, we support him, he's  making the impact on people's lives.\"  So I think the president just has to  have this two front in the one hand keeping an eye on these investigations  that he calls a witch hunt that so far have produced nothing but a waste of  taxpayer dollars --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's expensive.</p><p>CONWAY:  And it's getting really expensive.  We live through this before,  where are the same democrats who complained about previous investigations  that actually did bear fruit where a former president lied under oath and  obstructed justice.  We know what happened there.</p><p>They were -- they complained completely about the waste of taxpayer  dollars, I would up that end up to here.  And then, of course, the  president's main front is passing all this stuff, I work with him every  single day he and his senior team and his cabinet, his vice president  Maria, are forging ahead to create those jobs, to continue to have  confidence in the economy.  You see the small business manufacturing home  builder, consumer confidence numbers, you see the way the markets has  responded to this man's presidency.  He's been there five months tomorrow,  it's only five months.  People feel like things should be going faster and  faster because they know that's Donald Trump's pace.</p><p>But he's up against a Washington that moves much more slowly than he does  but I think the two shall meet.  And there's two paces and there's two ways  of doing business will actually produce -- continue to produce results for  real people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there's no doubt about it the president has been  incredibly successful in terms of rolling back regulations.  Whatever he  can do in terms of executive orders, without the congress, he's been able  to do and it's been very successful.</p><p>But he does face this goal on the left of just obstructing, stop the  agenda.  Chuck Schumer has been very clear.  They don't -- you're not going  to get democratic support.  I mean do you really think you're going to get  democratic support on tax reform or repeal and replace?  No.</p><p>CONWAY:  I feel like if people watch your show should call the democratic  senators and members of congress and say, \"Get on with it now.  Accept the  election results, stop with the resistance and move on to governing, move  on to leading.\"  </p><p>Because the democratic party is in an odd place right now, they had their  true leader, they're all arguing, they don't know what they're governing  philosophy is accepted, the message now is the message wasn't (inaudible)  Maria which is, \"You're terrible and I'm not you.\"  That's not a message,  that's an insult to anyone (inaudible).  But the democrats are stuck  somewhere between not being able to accept the 2016 election results and  being completely focused in the 2018 election results.</p><p>What about 2017?  What about governing?  What about leading?  What about --  you owe it to your constituents to get things done --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see -- yes.  We'll see if the public responds to the  obstructionism come '18.</p><p>CONWAY:  They were (inaudible) did you see the approval ratings?  Chuck  Schumer, the democrat, Pelosi their approval ratings are all much lower  than the president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.  All right.  Today, you've got a very  big meeting at the White House with technology CEOs.</p><p>CONWAY:  Yes, very exciting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The IT of government system is at focus, is that where the  priority is?  What's going to go on at the --  </p><p>CONWAY:  It is indeed.  And President Trump and Jared Kushner, his senior  adviser who runs the Office of American Innovation has been way on top of  this issue from day one.  </p><p>What is it?  We literally have government agencies and cabinets they can't  speak to each other because they have different programs.  And look at what  just happened recently in the last couple of weeks with the Veterans  Affairs Administration, you've got the Department of Defense and Veterans  Affairs literally weren't talking to each other.  So what Jared did is he  invited in the five brightest tech people or five tech experts in DoD, five  from Veterans Affairs and said, \"How can we get this together?\" </p><p>Viola, now we have a system in place where veterans will be treated as one  single patient seamlessly through both of those agencies.  So the idea is  to stop all this waste -- do you realize that LMB just finished with Y2K?   In 2017, do you realize that there are 1,000 different hotlines for  veterans to call the Veterans Affairs?  Do you realize that we spend -- the  average American spends like 30 hours a year on paperwork for the  government?  So we need a government agency that talks to each other and  make it seamless and modernize it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what the goal is today.</p><p>CONWAY:  And we're glad the tech CEOs are coming in to do that.  We know  that they have been incredibly successful, they do this for a living and  we're happy that they're coming to share their best practices with the  president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Kellyanne, good to see you.</p><p>CONWAY:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kellyanne Conway there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The death toll from last week's high-rise fire  in London is continuing to rise.  Cheryl Casone with the details now,  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes Maria, we're getting the numbers  unfortunately London police now says 79 people are now dead or missing  following that terrible fire at Grenfell Tower.  That's up from the last  update that we'd received a 58 dead or missing.</p><p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan says the fire was a preventable accident caused by  years of neglect from the government, their siding materials in that  building.  Local officials have come under heavy criticism for not  providing enough support or information.  So the cause of the fire was  (inaudible) 24 storey building does remain under investigation today but  there had been suggestions the new paneling used in a recent renovation may  have helped the flames move quickly at the outside of the building.  Again,  we're following the story for you out of London this morning.</p><p>We're also got (inaudible) at home Lockheed Martin in the final stages  negotiating a huge deal worth more than $37 billion.  The defense  contractor reportedly going to sell a record 440 F35 fighter jets serve  from 11 nations that does include the U.S.  The final price those jets  expected to be around $85 million.</p><p>And finally this is a way to make sure your child flies for free, give  birth onboard the aircraft.  A baby boy was born yesterday on an India Jet  Airways flight between Saudi Arabia to India.  The flight diverted to  Mumbai after a mom went into labor.  Luckily, a trained nurse was onboard,  and crew, and, of course, the passengers as well helped deliver that baby.   The airline has given the little boy Maria a free lifetime pass as a  birthday gift.  He flies for free for life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Thank you so much Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Brooks Koepka, how about that, swinging into the  history books this weekend with his first major championship.  The winner  of the U.S. Open, we've got all the highlights for a wild end for that  Open, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We have another first time winner of the major  championship in golf to report.  The U.S. Open wrapped up yesterday in  Wisconsin, we were happy to be there last week.  Jared Max with all the  highlights, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.  Seven straight major  won by a golfer who never won a major before.</p><p>27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka did in a record setting fashion.  All  tied up on the scoreboard with just six holes to go, Brian Harman now enter  Sunday lead to get minus 12 but fell apart with a couple of lay bogies on  12 and 13 as he was fall -- he would fall a couple of shots behind.  While  Brooks Koepka would to everything he needed to do.  Late in the tournament,  Koepka had birdies on 14, 15, and 16, eventually we would go to the 18th  hole and Brooks Koepka would manage to get in there for a birdie.  He  finishes at 16-under par, that ties Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest  score in relation to par at a U.S. Open.  Good for a check yesterday of  $2.16 million, that's the largest earning in one day in golf history,  congratulations to the 27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka.  </p><p>Last August, Kyle Larson earned his first career NASCAR victory at Michigan  International Speedway by beating out his friend Chase Elliot.  Yesterday,  Kyle Larson did it again.  In the target car, 15 laps to go at the  (inaudible) 400.  Larson would take advantage of a restart and claim the  lead from Kyle Bush and then with about 10 laps to go, you see Ryan  Blaney's care malfunctions, causes a pileup, Daniel Suarez gets clipped, he  runs in down (inaudible) into the wall.  Final laps though, Kyle Larson  scores his third career win and second of the season and celebrates with  his son on Father's Day.</p><p>All right.  So the Warriors lost the NBA title last year and then they  signed Kevin Durant and then they beat the Cavaliers for the championship  this year.  So now it's the Cavaliers turn to make a splash, right?  Well  according to Yahoo's Vertical, the Cavaliers received a phone call this  weekend from the Indiana Pacers who wanted to know if they might be  interested in making a trade for All Star Paul George who reportedly told  the team he will opt out of his contract in 2018 to become an unrestricted  free agent.  Paul George average nearly 24 points gain for the Pacers and  he is also friends with Lebron James back in April.  Lebron posted this on  Instagram saying, \"Nothing but love and respect.  Love the battle last  night bro.  I'm glad to see you back where you belong\" and includes this  hashtag #youngking because Lebron is king.  So maybe this is the beginning  of a recruiting process, Paul George, what a talented player, he's beaten a  bad injury, his back, so Cleveland would have to give up an arm and a leg  together.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was going to say, who are they  going to give up?</p><p>MAX:  Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love maybe.</p><p>BAKER:  You can't give up Kyrie.  No, no.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Paul George is no Kevin  Durant.  </p><p>MAX:  Correct.  Very few people are.  </p><p>BAKER:  Do you think Erin Hills is going to take -- that was the first  time they hosted the Open, are they going to take any heat for the  (inaudible)?</p><p>MAX:  Yes because the scores were way too strong.  We had more I  believe -- there were more scores under par yesterday than -- in this  tournament than we ever have in history as far as U.S. Open, so it wasn't  strong enough.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting if that's the case.  It was a long course,  they walked nine miles versus an average six miles on other course.</p><p>Let me ask you this, you got to explain this story to me, the Olympic  swimmer Michael Phelps has a new rival.  Phelps is going to face off  against El Great White Shark for a reality series on the Discovery Channel.   It's unclear how they're going to be raising against one another but it  will air during the Discovery Channel Shark Week, what do you make of this?</p><p>MAX:  Michael Phelps swims at best six miles per hour, a great white goes  twenty miles per hour.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what's the point?</p><p>MAX:  So I don't know how -- maybe -- somebody said maybe if Phelps gets a  head start, he starts first and then the shark coming after him maybe he  can get the seven miles an hour.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  (inaudible) the sharks chasing him, let's see how fast he  goes then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There will be some protective situation where he's in like a  tunnel of some sort.  I don't know, how are they going to do it.</p><p>MAX:  Maybe.  He's going to need a bigger boat.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Swim in a cage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to watch Discovery Channel for that one.   Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX:  Thanks Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared Max.

Rosecliff  Chief Executive Officer, Mike Murphy is here.  And Diligence President,  Mike Baker.  Good to see you everybody.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Really important conversation today, we're going to talk  about London, a fourth terrorist attack.  And in that meeting at the White  House Mike, I know you want to talk a lot about technology as well.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lot to get to this morning.  And coming up joining the  conversation this morning, the Adviser to President Trump, KellyAnne Conway  is joining us this morning.  So we're going to get into all of the above  with KellyAnne Conway when she joins us, coming up.</p><p>But first, terror strike in London again this morning.  British authority  say that the suspect has been detained as a van plowed into a crowd of  worshipers near a mosque in North London early this morning.  According to  London police, they are treating it as a possible act of terrorism.  One  man found dead at the scene though it is unclear if his death was related  to the attack.  At least 10 others were wounded.  The driver, a 48-year-old  man arrested at the scene after being detained by members of the public.   Video of the moment showed a Caucasian man being detained by police.   According to some reports, witnesses said that the driver was heard  shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.  Mike Baker, what do you make of this  attack?</p><p>BAKER:  Well I think the London authorities are right when they say, \"Look,  you got to condemn extremism no matter what it is.  This is not rocket  science.</p><p>A van drove in to a crowd of Muslims coming out of Mosque, it's Ramadan so  they're coming out, it's about a quarter twenty after midnight and so we  don't have to sit in angst and think too much about what this was all  about.  This is anger welling up from the recent attacks most likely that  had taken place in London whether the concert bombing or London in  Westminster Bridge attacks.  So --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess you look at the facts that it's four attacks in just  three months and try to put together the similarities as if it's ISIS  related but this doesn't seem to be that.</p><p>BAKER:  No, this is not.  Again, I don't -- I'm not one to sit and over  think something like this.  We just have to look at it, be pragmatic,  understand what it is and this is a response to what's been happening and  it's wrong and you can't -- what -- people always talk about sort of this  equivalency.  </p><p>\"Oh, if you talk like that or if you do drone campaigns then you lower  yourself to the level of the terrorist.\"  With the drones, I don't think  that's the case, I've never had a problem in operations in counterterrorism  differentiating myself from the bad guys.  But when something like this  happens, it does.  It's on the same level, you're attacking people coming  out their place of worship, you can't do it.</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean it's got to be a really scary time to live in London  because you have so many recent attacks and then there -- I'm sure there  are more people like this looking to respond to those attacks.</p><p>So you look back at all the people that they brought in to London and how  they let them branch off into little areas, pockets of their own  communities and it's got to be a really scary place to live right now.</p><p>BAKER:  Well it's a real divisiveness and you're absolutely right.  To  point out with this whole concept of multiculturalism that has developed  over decades now.</p><p>In the U.K. and now across the E.U. where the idea was, you don't  necessarily -- it was no effort to integrate within the society.  Celebrate  where you came from, celebrate your own culture.  Well that has created  this problem, this is a self inflicted wound to some degree and how they  resolve it, well in the immediate aftermath, they have to do what they're  doing which is Theresa May and all the other leaders have to come out,  condemn it, denounce, show transparency and a quick response just like they  would with any other attack.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But also push this idea that we will clamp down on any  extremism which they haven't done.  As you say, they're allowing people to  live in this no-go areas practice Sharia Law.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  The no-go thing is -- it's complicated, it's not quite the  narrative that has built up over a period of time now where somehow these  are (inaudible) police can't go in there, they go in there, they can go in  there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even in Paris?</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, even in Paris.  The problem is, it's not so much you have  access to go in there, the problem is developing communication.  And I know  this is going to sound touchy-feely at some 30,000 foot level but I'm  talking from an operational perspective.</p><p>You have to get into this communities, develop some level of trust in  communication in order so that when they see somebody, an immediate family  member, this is the only way you stop some of these folks is that the mom  or the cousin or the brother picks up the phone and has the ability to call  the local authorities.  So the no-go area is more of a tactical operation  which is no communication within these communities.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I do think this is a global issue though.  I mean we're  looking at London and what's happening right now in London.  Paris for a  while was the focus.</p><p>Here we've had -- even here in United States we've had so many issues.   This is global percolating -- percolation as a result I believe of ISIS --  as the result of this attack.  And so I think --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think is okay to do.</p><p>CARTER:  Well exactly.  When I think what -- this would have been an  opportunity for Theresa May I think to really regain confidence and she  hasn't really stepped up into that level.</p><p>And so I think it's really important right now that our world leaders step  up to the table and everybody says, \"Look, we're on the same page here,  let's stop with the blame game, let's just keep moving things forward and  let's start fresh.  There's so many opportunities right now on so many  things that we agree on, enough is enough let's move forward.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  Meanwhile, in Washington today, President  Trump meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White  House.  </p><p>This is the inaugural meeting of what they're calling \"The American  Technology Council.\"  Take a look at some of the leaders that are going to  be present there, the CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos will be there, as well as  Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, Tim Cook from Apple, IBM's Ginni Rommetty  just to name a few.  Mike Murphy, what do you make of this?  This is the  Trump Administration trying to update its IT they say.</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know how you can find a negative in this.  So Trump feels  like we need to serve the American people better with better technology so  he goes out and he gets the top people from the field of technology in the  world to advise him on it.  So I think -- and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What's wrong with that?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's the exact, right way to handle it and I think anybody  who doesn't show up or chooses not to show up is just showing a lack of  openness because you can debate.  </p><p>We can have different views on things but if I'm an expert in a certain  field and you're leading the country, you want to hear from me, you need to  hear from me.  So I think anybody who shows up there, it doesn't mean they  necessarily support President Trump, it means they support the United  States of America and I think it's a great thing that he's doing, I think  it's a great thing all of these people are doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to modernize the IT system of the U.S. is exactly what we  need by the way.  We're just looking at pictures of the president and the  first lady coming off of the plane from Camp David, the spent the weekend  in Camp David, Lee Carter.  He tweeted out that it was an honor to be there  as well.</p><p>CARTER:  I think that the American people are really glad to see him doing  these kinds of things.  I think they were -- there's a lot of criticism  spending time at his own property and I think people want to see President  Trump acting presidential doing a lot of the activities that they're used  to and I think there's something comforting about seeing him here.</p><p>I think it's also nice to see Barron in the picture too and enjoying  himself taking selfies being -- it's very, very human.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's being a kid.</p><p>CARTER:  Being a kid, yes.  </p><p>BAKER:  I wouldn't want to be a kid coming off of the Marine1.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I would have taken a selfie.  All right.  Let's talk  about the agenda for a second because senate republicans are working hard  to finalize their bill to replace ObamaCare.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he hopes to bring the bill  to the floor within the next two weeks.  Yesterday, I spoke with Senator  Marco Rubio he said the process will likely take a little longer.  Here's  what he told me on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) FLORIDA:  I think healthcare will happen this year,  tax reform we'll see.  We're working on that now, there's a component of it  that I'm working with Ivanka Trump on where there's the pro family  component of it and in fact we'll have a meeting this week with her and a  number of senators and house members to begin to layout that portion of the  agenda.</p><p>But I do think tax reform, these things can work simultaneously.  You don't  have to wait to finish on healthcare before you start formulating ideas on  tax reform and that's happening right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well I would expect the questions to really ramp up certainly  this week after what happened last week.  Steve Scalise is still on the  hospital obviously.  His condition was downgraded from a critical to  serious condition.  But do you worry about where the agenda stands now in  terms of tax reform and healthcare reform?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it seems like as if people after what happened last week,  people want to work together.  So hopefully, this was a bottom as far as  the divisiveness in Washington and now people can come together, put both  sides on the table and reach an agreement.</p><p>BAKER:  What I don't understand and maybe I'm just speaking this average  simpleton, when Marco Rubio says, \"You don't have to wait to start ideas on  tax reform\" why weren't the republicans doing this two years ago?  Why  didn't -- when they had this opportunity and they stepped in, they didn't  open the drawer, pull out their plan and say, \"Here it is, here's our tax  reform\" because that would have been the time to do this and not now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They repeal and replace.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.  I don't understand how Washington works, maybe that's as  simple as that.  I -- it's dysfunctional.</p><p>CARTER:  I think America does that's why Donald Trump is president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I will say this, there is a feeling the leadership says  continually that they are having meetings on tax reform right now just what  Marco Rubio just said that they are doing this behind the scenes in hopes  of getting this done this year.  Are you still a believer that they're  going to get something done?</p><p>CARTER:  I'm always an optimist and I hope they're going to get something  done.  I would love to see them say, \"We're going to work through the  summer break right now to get it done for the American people\" because  that's what they should do.  They made a promise, they should keep it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or they will do healthcare before July 4th which seems  incredible or maybe they get something out and then they do tax reform  after the summer, I don't know.  Two weeks.</p><p>CARTER:  It's just two weeks, yes.</p><p>BAKER:  They need the big legislative win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They do.</p><p>BAKER:  They have to have that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They really do.  We'll take a short break we've got a lot of  conversations on deck this morning.</p><p>Coming up in Colorado, some kids may go back to using a landline.

Cheryl Casone with the details now, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Maria.  Well a U.S.  navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian government warplane after it attacks  Washington best fighters near Raqqa.</p><p>This is according to statement from U.S.-led coalition, the coalition said  in that statement that the shoot down was in accordance with rules of  engagement and a number of (inaudible) fighters were wounded in the attack.   Fox News is reporting the Super Hornet that shot down the jet was based  onboard the USS George H.W. Bush which is currently operating in the  Mediterranean Sea.  </p><p>Meanwhile here at home, Colorado is considering banning preteens from  owning cell phones.  Residents in favor, the campaign say that kids under  13 years of age spend too much time on their phone.  Under proposed law,  cell phone retailers will be required to ask the age of the primary cell  phone user before it's sold, parents would not be allowed to buy phones for  their kids that are under the age of 13.  Retailers would face a $500 fine  if they don't comply with this one.</p><p>And Cars 3 sped, get it, into the number one spot at the box office over  the weekend.  This is the 16th Pixar film to debut at number one.

He won his first major championship, he finished  16 under matching Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest rating score to par  at a U.S. open.  Koepka now the third American to win the U.S. Open in a  row following Dustin Johnson last year and during the (inaudible) in 2015.   Maria, I watch the show that looks like you had a great time at the U.S.  Open.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is beautiful.  We really did enjoyed.  It was great Cheryl.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the -- as U.S. authorities consider expanding a ban  for carryon laptops, airlines are faking the consequences.  How a broader  ban could affect you with the airport, coming up.</p><p>Then one American businessman, $5 billion away from overtaking Bill Gates  as the world's richest person, we'll tell you who it is next, back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos coming closer to  becoming the world's richest man after the company announced the Whole  Foodss deal on Friday, Amazon shares soared adding nearly $2 billion to  Bezos' net worth.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, one firm says that the bidding for  Whole Foodss may only be getting underway -- just beginning to get  underway.  Joining us right now is Kingsview Asset Management Chief  Investment Officer, Scott Martin.  Scott, good to see you.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Hey  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What an incredible deal.  When we first heard that deal on  Friday, what do you say?  My instinct was, they're taking over the world,  Amazon, I mean it's pretty incredible.  What were your thoughts?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I was shocked.  I mean Amazon now wants to control your  grocery aisle.  And you know what's interesting Maria too, I think there's  a couple of things going on with this deal, first of all, it's been rumored  and it came together at a very last minute.  </p><p>In fact, Amazon was only supposedly working on this deal for a matter of  weeks which maybe speaks to your point about this just begins the whole  negotiation process with respect to this deal but as far as the grocery  aisle goes, this isn't a great business.  If you look at the grocery in the  last several years, consumers are becoming more discerning, profit margins  are lowering at the grocers.  So what exactly Amazon's going to do to the  grocery aisle and do how you shop for your groceries is going to be  interesting with respect to the big reach they have now with Amazon Prime  and some of the other things they're doing at the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean look, people saw the deal, Mike Murphy, and they  thought, \"Wow, this is an incredible combination, they bid up the stocks  but the grocery business not such an easy business, that's number one.  And  number two is this may not be so easy to take it over, the journalist  reporting the Neuberger Berman might be a bidder, that there's a new  process that other bids will come in.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I can see anyone coming into bid against Bezos and Amazon.   They have --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And paying more than $13 billion.</p><p>MURPHY:  Because if you do bid it up, I think Bezos, he obviously wants the  company, he can go in and bid above them, it's going to be hard to compete.   I mean maybe a Walmart could go in and try to compete but I don't really  see that.</p><p>I think Whole Foodss is going to be acquired by Amazon and it's a low  margin business, it's not a great business to be in but I think Bezos is  thinking two or three steps ahead.  I think he's thinking about using all  the Whole Foods stores over 400 stores nationwide as fulfillment centers,  as processing centers, as warehouses.  I think he's seeing all the Whole  Foods customers, the affluent customers as Amazon members.  Remember,  Amazon stock popped on Friday on this news, it went up and increased more  market value than the entire purchase price that they're paying for Whole  Foods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p>MURPHY:  So I think right now the market's betting on Bezos and thinking  Bezos is going to figure this out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about all the other supermarket companies that all sold  off?  I mean everybody was worried it.  You look at Kroger, you look at the  other supermart companies and -- I mean what was that all about?  Do you  think people were just nervous?</p><p>MURPHY:  It was Kroger, it was Walmart, it was all of the supermarket  companies just thinking that Amazon is getting in here now, they're going  to do what they did in e-commerce.  They're going to just crush margins,  they can afford to lose money for a number of years.  So therefore they  could really put a ton of pressure on all the other grocers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MURPHY:  But I there's potential there because I think there'll be more  consolidation amongst the other place.</p><p>BAKER:  Well Whole Foods been having problems for some time now, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They needed help.</p><p>BAKER:  And I wonder to what degree this might be in part a strategic shot  at Walmart, you mentioned Walmart.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, big -- I mean it's a big part of it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  Yes.  And remember, an activist hedge funds came in and took  a big stake, almost a 10 percent stake in Whole Foods Jana Partners and  they were putting a lot of pressure on the board to do something, that  definitely had something to do with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey Scott, jump in here.  What about -- then there's the Yahoo  story as well, end of an era, officially becoming Altaba as it starts  trading under a new name, Yahoo becomes Altaba.  Do you think the company  will be able to turn around now that the Verizon deal is done?</p><p>MARTIN:  You know it's interesting Maria, when you look at Yahoo in the  last say six to twelve months and those shareholders that waited around for  this end of the Marissa Mayer deal even or the era of Marissa Mayer, that  actually got reward to shareholders because that's really one of the other  thing that I think the company is seeing moving forward but I'll tell you  what's interesting as far as Yahoo and ramping this back in the Amazon, i  mean Amazon is taking over the internet too.</p><p>I mean you look at Amazon web services, you look at all the reach that they  have now with their website and their apps, I mean a lot of these companies  that are trying to compete with Amazon whether it is in the grocery aisle,  whether it is online are really losing this battle and as I think what Mike  pointed out, Amazon is willing to go into these markets wherever it is and  lose money just to get consumers and customers just to be beat out the  competition.</p><p>CARTER:  I mean I also think though -- and I'm really curious to what you  think about this, is, is that there was some kind of a status symbol  associated with being able to afford to go to Whole Foods and what -- and I  think there's an opportunity for some of these brands to really step up and  sort of that niche that experience but they are going to have to adopt with  the time.  Do you think that there's any other brand that's going to be  able to comment and take that place?  I'm kind of wondering if the Whole  Foods brand is going to become water down now.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  Well I'm seriously worried about.  And that the curious  part, I mean I'm concerned about this deal from a standpoint of and Mike  brought it up.</p><p>If he turns these into the fulfillment centers and warehouses, then what  happens?  I mean -- because I agree the -- exactly.  The Whole Foods  experience is really good.  You know what happens Maria around in Chicago,  they just have a new one that's by my house, you go there, you shop, you  have a couple of beers in the bar, you maybe watch the game.  I mean that  maybe go away now and I think that's what's interesting about this deal for  Amazon that they're making for Whole Foods, do they want to take away that  experience because to me that's the value of the shopping experience at  Whole Foods.</p><p>BAKER:  Best line I heard over the weekend was Bezos to pay cash for Whole  Foods.  Who pays cash at Whole Foods?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.  That's the best joke ever.</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Best joke ever.  Go ahead Scott, you want to react?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I mean -- well you can't afford to pay cash at Whole Foods  that's why I'm a company man because if you don't have enough cash to go in  there that's why the plastic is so good.</p><p>And that's the other thing, Amazon Prime is one of the best let's say  gateway drugs in the planet with respect to what Amazon Prime does for  those who actually ends up going on Amazon and just buying more stuff  because they're Prime members.  It's similar demographic to who does shop  at Whole Foods, so there's some cross over there but how they change them  and how they manipulate that into really big sales is the question that I  have on my mind today but something that Bezos I think is going to answer  in the next couple of years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  Scott real quick, markets  are up today, you put new money to work or no?  Are you pulling back?</p><p>MARTIN:  No, I'm putting money to work Maria.  In fact, I love the tech  sector, they've beaten down the last couple of weeks because of investors  getting nervous.  That's been weak money, I think strong money is going to  come back in here towards the end of the quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  You agree with that Mike Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY:  I do completely.  It's opportunity here.  Market, there's a bit  under the markets goes higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tough first quarter for tech.  All right.  Scott, good to see  you sir.  Thank you. </p><p>MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, British Prime Minister Theresa May in the spotlight  this morning as formal negotiations for Brexit are underway.  How the  European Union is expected to respond as Britain moves to exit, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: Welcome  back!  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 19th, your top stories right now  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London is on edge, once again this morning.   At least one person has been killed and several others injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in north London; police are treating  this as a terrorist attack.  Meanwhile, Britain also focused on  negotiations for its exit from the European Union; those talks begin today  in Brussels.  We've got a lot at what's at stake.  The possibility of a  laptop ban as airlines scrambling, what it would mean for your trip to the  airport?  </p><p>And markets are rallying this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a  gain of 60 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average today at the open;  NASDAQ, strong by 35.  In Europe, markets are up across the board.  Take a  look at the indices in the Eurozone with the FTSE 100, up one-half of one  percent; and the CAC40 and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  In Asia,  overnight, mostly higher as you see across the board, actually; Nikkei  Average in Japan up two-thirds of a percent; Hang Seng Index and Hong Kong  up better one percent.  </p><p>And the Southwest facing blazing hot triple digit temperatures today,  that's not keeping tourist away though, in fact, they are flocking to Death  Valley.  We will tell you all about it.  Amazon and Wal-Mart on a collision  course for sure now, Wal-Mart announcing its own deal; what the competition  means for the company is coming up.  And the Vice President getting an  extra special Father's Day present; the Pence family welcome two new furry  members: a kitten and a puppy.  All of those stories coming up this  morning.  </p><p>First, our top stories this half an hour: Britain has been rocked by a  tragedy yet again.  London police are investigating a possible terrorist  attack outside of a mosque late last night.  Investigators say that a 40- year-old man rammed a van into a crowd injuring ten people, at least.  One  man was found dead at the scene; it is unclear, however, if that death is  related to this attack.  Prime Minister, Theresa May, is planning to hold  an emergency meeting on the case later today.  </p><p>Joining us right now: the Wall Street Journal U.K. and Brexit Editor,  Stephen Fidler.  Steven, good to have you, thanks so much for joining us.   I want to get to Britain exiting the E.U. in a moment, but first, this is  the fourth major attack in the U.K. since March; what is your reaction?  </p><p>STEPHEN FIDLER, WALL STREET JOURNAL AND BREXIT EDITOR:  Well, I think it's  certainly a surprise than worried people here.  And I think there's an  extra air of uncertainty, not only with these attacks but with the building  fire last Wednesday.  So, London, in particular, I think is feeling this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a feeling that things need to change in terms of  security?  I mean, how are people feeling in terms of why this is  happening, why London has been under such attack just in the last three  months or so?</p><p>FIDLER:  Well, I think the - I think there is a sense that things need to  change, and there is a question that obviously the security services have  in terms of what they're going to do to deal with people who appear radical  but don't necessarily appear set of violence, you know, what to do to stop  these people going into violence.  So, that's one thing; I think there'll  be a lot of community policing and these kinds of things.  So, I would say,  you know, London has noticed this, but I was down at Borough Market despite  those attacks on London Bridge a week or so ago on Friday, and the place  was just teeming with people.  I mean, it's a - you know, London isn't  shutting down in any sense.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  I'm curious what the political  environment is like there?  Here in the U.S., people say enough with the  partisanship.  It seems like the U.K. is having a very, very similar  experience right now.  And I'm just curious how people are looking at  Theresa May, and is she going to be able to lead us through this?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think you hit on something there.  I think there is a lot of  political uncertainty, particularly given what the election result was last  - a couple weeks ago.  In a sense that she expected to come with an  increased majority; we expected to have a stronger government, and in many  ways, we have a weaker one, she doesn't even have a majority in the House  Commons.  And it looks like she's kind of uncertain in handling a lot of  these things.  You know, she hasn't been very adept at adjusting to and  dealing with the crisis as they've come one after the other.  So, I think,  you know, there is the sense of the government is, you know, not reacting  to this very well, and that she, in particular, is struggling to cope with  all of the things on her plate, you know, including the Brexit negotiation  which is starting today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIVE:  Stephen, you  just something, I think is very important, you just referred to community  policing when you talk about how we try to get ahead of the curve here.  To  what degree do you think the Met Police, or MI-5, or others had had or  having success in developing some line of communication within the Muslim  communities here in the U.K?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think they've done that.  Obviously, they'll be looking at  what's happened and figure they haven't done it will enough, and it's one  of those things that's come into the political debate here which is whether  the cutbacks that have taken place in terms of government spending since  the financial crisis certainly have reduced the numbers of policemen and  reduced the numbers of police on the streets.  So, that sends at the  political debate with the Labour Party saying, you know, this is a  consequence of the conservative policies that there aren't as many police  on the street as they used to be in, and the community policing that used  to go on five years ago or so, isn't happening to the same degree now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to be watching that.  That's a really  important point to bring up.  Let me switch gears and ask you about talks  officially underway now for Britain to leave the European Union; what are  you expecting here, Stephen, in terms of David Davis-the Brexit Secretary- meeting with the E.U.'s Chief Negotiator in Brussels; that meeting  happening right now.  David said that you're determined to build a strong  partnership.  Listen to this; I want to get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, BREXIT SECRETARY:  There's more that unites us than divides  us.  So, while we were ghastly to be, challenging times ahead of us in the  negotiations, we will do all we can to assure that we deliver that works in  the best interest of all citizens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there are concerns that Prime Minister  Theresa May's government is too fragile when she the majority in the snap  election two weeks ago.  Their growing calls for her to drop her plan of  the hard exit out of the E.U.; what are your thoughts here?  How does this  play out?  </p><p>FIDLER:  Well, it's a - I think a when Theresa May called an election in  April, there was a feeling in Europe, in Brussel that, OK, we're going to  have a stronger leader in the U.K. that can deliver on the promises she  makes in the negotiations.  So, that hasn't happened.  So, I think on the  other side of the, you know, from European Union perspective, there is sort  of, you know, a lot questions about who they're dealing, and whether this  woman is going to be in charge six months from now, and whether they should  make concessions in negotiations with someone who might not be around for a  very long.  </p><p>And on the other hand, as you say, in the U.K., she less able to deliver on  the promises, you know, because the House of Commons is divided, as some of  their own party don't want the kind of hard  Brexit.  And you know, it's  possible that the House of Commons or the House of Lords, which is the  unelected second chamber could overturn a lot of what she's trying to do.   So, I think we're entering these negotiations only 21 months to go before  the U.K. leaves the E.U. in a very uncertain situation.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF VENTURES FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Stephen,  it's Mike Murphy, I would think of these recent attacks that's in the U.K.  that the people who are going to be voting would want to be more for  Brexit, so that they could kind of control their borders, and maybe be  safer as a group.  Do you see that gaining any momentum kind of the pro- Brexit crowd because of the recent attacks?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I don't see that as a - the opinion polls don't seem to show that.   I mean, there is an element of that in the discussions.  I mean, you know,  even in the European Union, the UK. could - you know, they're always  possible controls from other people coming in for the U.K.  So, it's not  quite true to say the U.K. didn't control these borders.  What it had an  issue with was people coming into, and working in the U.K. from other parts  of the European Union, and the U.K. could say, quote his answer.  So, I  think there's a slightly different questionnaire, and I think from the  other side of the coin is the state of the British economy.  I mean, the  pound fell very sharply after the referendum last year.  Inflation is  starting to feed through, and people are fighting their standard of living  being eroded.  So, maybe that the sorts of an anti-Brexit crowd are kind of  getting a little more growing, somewhat, because of concerns about the  economy.  </p><p>BAKER:  Stephen, Mike Baker here again, do you feel that comment of David  Davis is correct when he said that there's more that unites the U.K. with  U.E. and then divides you?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think there's a -- there's a sense in both - in which both sides  want a good deal out of this.  I don't think it's in any - nobody thinks  it's in their interest, but this all blows up and that's a sort of a big  break, or at least very few people think that's a - that's a great idea.   So, I think that's true.  I think that the thing that's left unsaid and  really that the U.K. hasn't held its answer is what actually do they  (INAUDIBLE) from this new relationship.  And certainly, some of the things  that they've outlined don't seem to be likely to be agreed on the other  side.  So, I think the - actually, the E.U. said much more about what it's  -- how it's going to approach the negotiations than the U.K. - than the  U.K. has.  There are a lot of unanswered questions about what the U.K.  really is looking for out of all of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen, then new developments in France, newly elected  President, Emanuel Macron consolidating power.  His party obviously winning  a clear majority in parliament overnight what does this victory mean for  the E.U.?</p><p>FIDLER:  It's interesting because it's contrast very much with what's going  on in the U.K., where you have - you have a leadership that is weakened.   Now, we've had this guy coming almost from nowhere in a year, creating a  political movement, becoming the President of France and gaining a huge  majority in the parliament to push through the kind of things that he said  he wants to do, which is including reforming the French slave market.  So,  I think the narrative in which the U.K. went into the sort of referendum  which was a declining European Union and sort of strengthening Britain.   That sort of - that kind of mood music has changed because I think the --  to some extent, anyway, and I wouldn't want to exaggerate this, the E.U.  has got its mojo back partly thanks to, what, some Macron who was a very  pro-E.U. candidate is doing, and also the fact that Angela Merkel looks as  if she's going to come back as chancellor, possibly with, you know,  increased majority or an increased size of her party.</p><p>So, in a sense, you know, it looks like the E.U. is sort of moving forward  to an extent that we didn't expect a year ago.  I mean, Macron's problem is  going to be not in the parliament now.  The question is going to be, what  happens in the streets?  How are they going to react?  The trade unions and  others, how are they going to react to what he's trying to do in the labor  market and to reform the economy?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's an important point, and that obviously becomes  clearer over the months and days to come.  Stephen, great to get your  insights.  Thanks so much.  Stephen Fidler joining us this morning in  London.</p><p>FIDLER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Boeing takes flight with a new plane.  How the  jetliner could rub up competition against rival, Airbus.  Stock has been on  fire of Boeing.  Then, Vice President Mike Pence ads some four-legged  friends to his family.  Their cute new pet social media debut, straight  ahead.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher this morning.  Take a  look at Futures indicating a pretty good rally at the opening of trading.   68 points higher on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  We're watching a  couple of names for you.  Boeing unveiled its first new jet in four years.   The company will develop a bigger 737.  Boeing says 10 customers have  already committed to buying that plane.  The announcement coming at the  Paris air show as the jetmaker looks to take on rising competition from  Airbus.</p><p>We are watching the banks this morning, including JPMorgan Chase.  The  Federal Reserve is set to release the latest result of the stress test  beginning Thursday this week.  Investors are hoping that the banks will get  approval to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends.  And U.S.  Airlines gearing up for the possibility of an expanded ban of carryon  laptops.  Cheryl Casone on that detail right now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria, we were thinking  that we might get news like this.  So, that initial ban that was put into  effect in May by the U.S. and the U.K. did affect some flights from the  Middle East and North Africa.  A ban now under consideration by the Trump  administration would involve flights originating for as many as 71 airports  around the world.  Big expansion.  That would mean additional security  checks and most likely a lot of angry international customers.  </p><p>Well, we're watching an extreme heat wave happening right now as out in the  southwest, parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah all really  suffering.  Temperatures expected to climb well above 110 degrees this week  in several parts of that region.  Death Valley, that's the hottest place in  America could see, get this, 124 degrees tomorrow.  And we are told that  some tourists actually finding to go there to experience Death Valley in  124 degrees.  No, not a smart idea.  </p><p>All right.  Another headlines this morning.  Good God.  Wal-Mart is going  shopping for an online retailer.  The company - this actually went down on  Friday, Maria, is buying Bonobos, they sell men's clothing for $310 million  in cash.  Now, this deal coming as Wal-Mart takes on Amazon for the future  of retail, and of course, it's on the same date that Amazon announced the  big deal, of course, to buy whole foods.  Wal-Mart has been moving  aggressively to try and transform himself into a major e-commerce power.   They bought jet.com last year for more than $3 billion (AUDIO GAP) today as  you could see on your chart under pressure, though, this morning.</p><p>And then, Vice President Mike Pence celebrated Father's Day by adding two  new members to the family.  The Pences welcomed a new kitten and dog into  their home.  The V.P.'s daughter, Charlotte, posted pictures of the new  addition, Charlie and Hazel.  They replaced the Pence's beagle, Maverick,  who died shortly before for the election.  And then (INAUDIBLE) of a cat,  Oreo, who passed away earlier this month.  They joined Pickles, another  family cat, by the way.  And they also have a bunny, Maria, named Marilyn  Van Dough.  They love (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Marilyn, Hazel, Pickles.  I love it.  I love it. </p><p>CARTER:  I always trust people who - I always trust people who love animals  more than those that's -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me, too.  That's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are on this story, ladies and gentlemen.  For all  new Mike Pence pet news, you (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of pets.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  fighting crime and making a return on your investment at the same time.   Why superhero comic books are trending at the auction block.  We'll tell  you about it, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  May 2017 was a win for comic books with $48.2  million worth of merchandise ordered.  This after comic book sales had a  20-year sales record last August who was (INAUDIBLE) by the success of both  the Marvel and D.C. Film Universes.

Thank you so much  for being here.</p><p>VINCENT ZURZOLO, COMICCONNECT.COM CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your auction of nearly 18,000 comics just closed last  night.  How did it go?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  We had a record week last week.  Closed from Monday through  Friday last week, and preauction estimated were $4 to $5 million.  We broke  $7 million on the auction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  We can make the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think is behind this obsession with comic books  that we have.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Well, I think people are very nostalgic and they're trying to  recapture the happiest times of their life, their childhood.  But I also  think it has a lot to do with the - that comic books have become  commodities.  They are all encapsulated in hard plastic holders from CGC  grading company which is the world's largest grading company.  And they are  encapsulated in these comic book holders, and it makes people who don't  know how to grade a comic book makes them able to buy and sell comic books.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because actually we're looking - I  was thinking, yes, there is that, that we want to relive our childhood, and  I'm thinking, \"Well, that's really wholesome, right?\"  But some comics are  not wholesome.  I've seen a lot of comics.  My husband likes comic books.   And some of these comic books get serious.  I mean, it's not so wholesome.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Well, they're not all for little kids.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Exactly.  Like my husband.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  You know, so there are - there you go.  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what is the attraction, do you think?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  So, I think it's nostalgia, I think it's this idea that you -  it's a form of entertainment, it's escapism, it's a form of investing.   People are not so in love with - I think nowadays ever since the recession,  traditional forms of investment.  They have to have - become their own type  of investor.  So, they look at things they love, tangible assets like  vintage comic books.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And one of them that you brought in was the comic in which  Superman appears for the second time.  Let's look at that one here.  How  much does that one go for at all?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  This comic book, the second cover appearance of Superman went for  $188,000.  What's important about this is, this is the court case copy.   This was used when D.C. Comics sued Fox who had made an intimation Superman  back in the 40s, 30s and 40s.  And -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's show that one.  That's this one right here.  Yes.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Because if you the stamp, the court case stamp.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is the court case stamp.  Wow.  Because they made a  Superman -</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes, Wonderman who was kind of a rip off from Superman.  But this  is the comic book that sold for the most in our auction is the first  appearance of Superman in action comics number one.  Now, my company holds  records, world record.  We sold the first million-dollar comic book, 1.5,  2.2, and over 3 million.  This copy is conserved.  It has a little bit of  conservation done to it to maintain the structural integrity.  This comic  book, we estimated to sell for about $200 to $250,000, sold for $393,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  What -- now what does a collector do with that?   Just keep it covered and it's just - that's the price.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  I think it's in their safe or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $300,000 for a comic?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  $393,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Almost 400 grand for this cover.  Batman, a  significant character in D.C. Comics.  Why did that one bring in such a  large amount of money?  Tell us about the Batman.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  So, Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman.  This  comic book is actually restored.  If it wasn't restored, it would sell for  over a million dollars easy.  This comic we estimated to sell for about 200  to 250.  It sold for $313,000.  People love Batman, they love Superman.   These are two of the biggest characters in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  But what about characters today?  Are there new  characters that have emerged today that perhaps could command these kinds  of numbers? </p><p>ZURZOLO:  You know, there's a comic book that came out.  You might have  heard of it, The Walking Dead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Well, it's a huge T.V. show.  Walking dead is huge.  That's  comic book in perfect condition.  The number one copy can sell for over  $3,000, which is really exciting.  Our company will be bringing the world's  best collection of Walking Dead to auction later this year to coincide with  New York Comic-Con as well as an original art collection that's going to  blow the minds of many people around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how do you choose something like that, Walking Dead.  Why  did you think Walking Dead would be a good thing?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  I never did.  You know, it's not my market.  But I started  reading them and a comic book done in black and white that was done so  effectively.  It was just amazing.  When you read the original comic book,  you understand why it's become a worldwide phenomenon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating.  Vincent, great to have you.  Thanks so much for  walking us through it.  </p><p>ZURZOLO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Vincent Zurzolo there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  Congressman Steve Scalise's condition has improved.  He is upgraded from  critical to serious, just coming after he was shoot last week during  baseball practice with other Republican lawmakers.  The details next hour.   MORNINGS WITH MARIA back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th.  Here are  your top stories 7 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning.  London on edge again.

I just want  to --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p>BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p>BAKER:  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p>They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p>A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p>Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p>And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p>So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p>And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p>Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p>Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p>And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p>BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p>BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p>I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p>CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p>MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p>KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p>BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p>KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p>KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p>KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p>Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.  What we know about the attacker this morning.   Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.  </p><p>Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues.  The  Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire  Whole Foods.  The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning!  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p>And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.

Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p>WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p>PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p>But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p>PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na[ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p>MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p>BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p>PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p>We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p>MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p>BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p>And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p>CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p>CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday June 19.</p><p>Here are your top stories 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning: London on edge again.  At least one person has  been killed, several others injured after a man plowed his van into a crowd  near a mosque in northern London.  British Prime Minister Theresa May  addressing the attack moments ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  This morning, our country woke to  news of another terrorist attack on the streets of our capital city; the  second this month and every bit as sickening as those which have come  before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to London straight ahead to get the  latest there.</p><p>Meanwhile, YouTube taking steps to combat extremism.  Details on the  company's new policies coming up.</p><p>Technology executives are descending on the White House today.  Top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's IT system for a  meeting at the White House with the President.  Among the CEOs attending:  Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, IBM CEO Ginny Rometty among  others.</p><p>Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading today -- take a look.   Markets are at the highs of the morning right now.  Dow Industrials  expected to be up 70 points.  Nasdaq up almost 40 points right now --  that's two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>In Europe, gains across the board as well to report.  The FT 100 in London  up two-thirds of a percent.  The CAC 40 in Paris up almost 1 percent.  The  DAX index as well.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets close higher also.  The Hang Seng in Hong Kong  best performer -- up better than 1 percent.</p><p>And Brooks Koepka makes a name for himself at the U.S. Open. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Koepka -- our major champion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he became the third straight American to win the U.S.  Open.  We've got all the highlights.</p><p>What's old is new again apparently.  Atari makes a comeback with a new  console.  This is the first new console in 20 years.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it: the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter is here; the CEO of  Rosecliff Mike Murphy is here; and the president of Diligence Mike Baker is  here.  Great to see you.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot on deck today.</p><p>BAKER:  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Sure is.  Some great guests, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got important guests coming up to talk about what's  going on in London.  We're going to take you live to London momentarily.</p><p>The story out of the White House this morning in terms of technology and  Mike these markets are looking firmer.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Firm, new highs and I think there is a bit  underneath the market.  A lot of negatives out there but the market, as  they say, finds a wall of worry and that's what we're getting right now --  earnings supporting higher prices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning: the counselor to  President Trump Kellyanne Conway is here -- don't miss that.  She's coming  up this hour.</p><p>First though new questions surrounding whether President Trump is actually  under investigation or not by the special counsel looking into Russia's  alleged election meddling.</p><p>On Friday the President tweeted this.  \"I'm being investigated for firing  the FBI director by the man who told me to fired the FBI director.  Witch  hunt.\"</p><p>But yesterday a member of the President's legal team contradicted that  tweet.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, MEMBER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM:  The President has not  been notified by anyone that he is under investigation.  That tweet, Chris  was in response to the \"Washington Post\" story that alleged that five  unnamed sources, anonymous sources linked to the \"Washington Post\" that the  President was in fact under investigation.  So that tweet was in response  to that.  </p><p>There has been no notification of any investigation.  Nothing has changed  since James Comey said the President was not a target or a subject of  investigation.  Nothing's changed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst right now,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- good to see.  Good morning.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on all of this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I think it's a little bit in the weeds because if you  have the former FBI director making a case for attempted obstruction of  justice or even bribery against the President of the United States and  making it in a fairly forceful way.  Whatever you think of him as an FBI  director, that is certainly enough to trigger an investigation.</p><p>So I think both sides are right.  I think that the President is being  investigated but he is not a target.  A target means they plan to bring  charges against you.  So when Jay Sekulow says he hasn't gotten a target  letter that it's probably technically true but it doesn't mean that he's  not been investigated.</p><p>State differently the FBI must investigate allegations of the nature and  quality that James Comey alleged in that senate testimony that he gave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I don't know why the President feels the need to respond  to something like a \"Washington Post\" report.  He calls them fake news  anyway.  So why respond?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he has had tremendous success in energizing  his base -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  I know.  I get that.  I get that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- with his tweets.  No human being in the modern era has had  the success that he has in communicating with his supporters and bypassing  the media.</p><p>But this is a dangerous area for him because we now see federal judges  taking literally Sean Spicer's statement.  The President's tweets official  government communications and federal judges using statements made in the  tweets to undermine oral arguments that his Justice Department is making in  court.</p><p>So he at times while undermining the base may be working at cross purposes  with what his Justice Department is trying to persuade federal judges.</p><p>BAKER:  This may not be a fair question, Judge but what is your gut  feeling?  Where is this going?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know.  I wish I did.  I don't know where it's going  but I do believe that -- as I just said to all of you -- the allegations  that James Comey made were said with such credibility and confidence that  they can't be ignored and they will investigated.</p><p>Now, here is a good side of this.  Sometimes the FBI in the early stages  before you are a subject down here, before you're a target up here you are  sort of in the mix.  They may want to exclude certain people from becoming  subjects and targets and in order to do that they have to conduct an  investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I think we should start looking at where the real  obstructionism has been in that where we know it was.  Senate Republicans  are now turning their attention and their investigative eyes to former  attorney general Loretta Lynch.  Some are saying that they want her to  testify after alarming accusations by the former director, Jim Comey, in  his recent congressional testimony.</p><p>Here is one thing he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  At one point the Attorney General had  directed me not to call it an \"investigation\" but instead to call it a  \"matter\" which confused me and concerned me.  But that was one of the  bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the  department if we are going to close this case credible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was one of three things people are talking about in  terms of why Loretta Lynch needs to be investigated.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Number one, the matter versus investigation.  Number two, the  tarmac meeting -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- two days before Hillary Clinton was to testify, she met with  her husband President Clinton on the plane.</p><p>And number three, apparently there is a memo floating around that has not  been widely disseminated but basically says -- suggests that Loretta Lynch  I will be getting involved.  I'll make sure the FBI investigation of  Clinton doesn't go too far.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Now, we don't know if this memo exists.  But the reports on  the memo are the recipient of it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- the then chair of the Democratic National Committee.  Now  this was back before the DNC, when Bernie Sanders' candidacy was still  alive and Mrs. Clinton had not yet been exonerated by Jim Comey.  Just as I  said that Comey painted enough of a serious case against the President to  warrant investigation by the special prosecutor.</p><p>He clearly painted enough of a case against Loretta Lynch to be  investigated by not the senate judiciary committee but the same FBI, the  regular FBI, the Justice Department -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and not the special prosecutor.</p><p>Now, it is odd and has only happened in rare instances that an attorney  general investigates his predecessor.  It happened, of course when John  Mitchell, Richard Nixon's Attorney General was prosecuted and convicted and  went to jail.  </p><p>But I am telling you there are enough allegations stated in a credible way,  supported by other forensic evidence like we saw pictures of her with Bill  Clinton -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- to warrant a criminal investigation of Mrs. Lynch for  misconduct in office.  Did she use the Justice Department as a political  instrument to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not to mention all of the spying that went on and the  unmasking.  Then there's that.  I am just throwing this out there because  there is a fair amount of things out there to investigate -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- at this point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  but remember, this is not Bob Mueller.  This is Jeff Sessions  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and whoever is running.  It is still Andrew McCabe because  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- Christopher Wray has not yet been confirmed.  It is the  regular DOJ that should be investigating her.</p><p>BAKER:  What I worry and this is what happens in Washington it seems like  all the time which is all these various issues now get molded together, the  public becomes utterly confused over where we're going with this.  And  eventually it all goes away and dies.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now it gives the impression of either scandal or  instability, neither of which is good to give that impression coming from  the Justice Department which is supposed to be relatively neutral -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- doing the right thing, enforcing the rule of law devoid of  politics and above the fray.  It doesn't seem to be that way right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I brought up the memo because there is also  speculation that is totally fake -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- I mean does it exist or not.  We don't know.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  We do know that the \"matter\" thing is true because -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The \"matter\" is true.  He testified under oath.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You'll get a peek at this because Mike -- you live in this  environment.  FBI agents were poking the director in the ribs saying,  you're now the director of the federal bureau of matters.  It's a criminal  investigation -- where is this \"matter\" nonsense coming from? </p><p>BAKER:  We've got to change the logo.  It's going to cost money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. Let's talk about a case that has really rocked  Hollywood and that is, of course, Bill Cosby; a shocking outcome to the  Bill Cosby sexual assault trial yesterday.  The judge declared a mistrial  after the jury was deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberation.</p><p>Judge -- what does this mean for the case against the comedian?  Walk us  through what a mistrial looks like.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  A judge must determine that no further deliberation time is  likely to change anybody's opinion.  Now we don't know if it's 11 to 1 or 6  to 6 or some combination.  Obviously you need unanimity for a conviction  and unanimity for acquittal.  And they didn't have unanimity.</p><p>Some judges will just ask the jury foreman, can you tell me Madam Foreman,  whether or not in your opinion any further deliberation will help.  Some  judges -- this is what I used to do were asked each individual juror.   Don't tell me how you're voting.  That's none of my business.  I want to  know if you still have an open mind or if you are steadfast and nothing  else will change that opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And once the judge comes to that conclusion well then it's  simply a waste of time.  The prosecutors have announced that they will  retry him probably in the fall or the winter.</p><p>This is a very, very strange case because he received a promise, Bill  Cosby, from a prosecutor don't worry you're not going to be prosecuted you  can give a deposition into what happened.  He gave the deposition, the  prosecutor died.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The new prosecutor can -- the judge said, the promise is only  good for as long as he's the prosecutor.  So they can use your own words  against you.  That's called a built-in appeal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is extraordinary.  That's incredible.  </p><p>Judge -- thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great insights as always from you.  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>The U.K. authorities are now investigating that van attack near the London  mosque early this morning as a possible terrorist attack.  </p><p>Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is on the ground in  London right now with the very latest.  Benjamin -- good morning to you.</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you  from London.  Well, yet another attack hitting London over here but, of  course, what it so s strikingly different in this case is that this was an  attack on Muslims.  Of course, we have seen vehicles being used time and  time again.  But not like this.</p><p>And as you said, this is now being treated as an act of terrorism and  investigated by the counter terrorism unit.  It happened just after  midnight here in Finchley, north London outside a Muslim center.  At a time  when the neighborhood was crowded with Muslims finishing Ramadan prayers.   It seems that the attacker knew when prayers ended and he was waiting.</p><p>Muslim leaders have now called it a hate crime and they've asked the public  to stay calm and try to avoid divisions within the community.</p><p>Police have arrested the driver.  He's a 48-year-old white man.    He was  grappled to the ground by two bystanders until the police could arrive.   Those two men are being called heroes.</p><p>Eyewitnesses have also reported that he said a number of times \"I've done  my bit\" and \"I want to kill Muslims.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He did what he did deliberately to hit and kill as many  Muslims as possible.  So he is a terrorist.  So at this stage we are  calling for calm.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HALL:  And the video has also emerged showing the attacker apparently  blowing a kiss from the police van that he was been taken away.  He's been  taken to the hospital.  He's going to be charged when he is let out of  there.</p><p>But a lot of people are saying this is exactly what ISIS wanted.   (inaudible) the narrative.  It helps to create even greater divisions.  And  so right here where we are now in London very much on edge.  It's a very  multi-ethnic, very diverse neighborhood and the police really are just  trying to keep it safe, keep it under control.  The Prime Minister coming  out as well and saying this was not only an attack on this community.  It  was an attack on the whole of the country.  Back to you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.

That collision happened early Saturday  morning as many of the crew slept.  Secretary Sean Stackley praised the  crewmembers for saving the USS Fitzgerald from further damage and bringing  it back into part.  And of course, the sad story is they find those  sailors.</p><p>Representative Steve Scalise's condition, we should say, has now been  upgraded to serious from critical.  According to Medstar Washington  Hospital Center, the congressman had more surgery over the weekend but he  does continue to show signs of improvement.  </p><p>And Scalise did not let his health crisis get in the way of father's day.   He said on the father's day message on twitter, saying quote, \"Steve's  greatest joy is being a father to Madison and Harrison and a husband to  Jennifer.  This father for the Scalise family and they send their best  wishes to every family especially the dads.  Take the time to be close to  the ones that you love.</p><p>Of course Scalise, one of five people wounded last week when a gunman  opened fire on Republicans at a baseball practice in suburban, Virginia.</p><p>Well, tomorrow's special election in Georgia.  It's too close to call.  And  the two candidates are scrambling for last-minute votes.

The company says it's making a  video game console for the first time in more than 20 years.  It's called  the Atari box, Some of the world's most iconic video games ran of course,  on Atari including Pong, Pac-Man.  Atari filed for bankruptcy in 2013.   They emerged here later as the company focused on mobile and online games  but the company says that Atari box is based on PC technology.

I bought my three little boys Scooter, Slughorn (ph) and  Mugsie (ph).  I bought them an old Atari and they love this thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BAKER:  And I was worried.  I thought they're going to look at it and go,  \"are you kidding me\".  They loved it.</p><p>MURPHY:  They take the Atari over the iPhone?</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.

Tracee -- good morning to you.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>Now the parent company of Google says it is working to remove all videos  that violate YouTube's community guidelines such as those promoting  terrorism.  YouTube will increase technology and the number of experts to  flag terrorist-related content and videos that do not meet grounds for  removal but still promote offensive viewpoints will come with a warning and  will not be able to be recommended, endorsed or commented on by users  making them harder to find.  </p><p>YouTube will also use targeted online advertising to reach potential ISIS  recruits and then redirect them towards anti-terrorism videos that can  change their minds about joining.  A spokesperson for Google says quote,  \"There should be no place for terrorist content on our services.\"</p><p>The changes come after reports that one of the suspects in the London  Bridge terror attack became radicalized after watching pro-ISIS videos on  YouTube.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have faced harsh criticism for not  doing enough to remove extremist content from their Web sites.  </p><p>It is a daunting task with, you know, over 400 videos uploaded per minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For a long time these companies, YouTube included, were getting  criticized for not doing enough.  Do you see this as enough.</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  I don't but I don't know what the answer is.  I think  somehow someway extremists are going to figure out a way to get their  message out there.</p><p>I don't know if these companies can actually do enough to stop it, if they  can do anything to stop it because I think the terrorists will get around  it someway.</p><p>BAKER:  This is an advantage.  This is actually a good move.  I agree, it's  not going to solve the problem entirely.  But it is in combination with a  variety of other things including locating, identifying and taking them  out.  This sort of step is also very helpful.</p><p>CARTER:  But I can't help but wonder, I mean with all the big data  advancements and they know who the target audiences are that are on their  sights, what they're interested in so they can serve up advertisement.  How  can they not know what else is going on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's a good point you make because they've got  all these measurement tools -- </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to track everything else.  How come they can't track this  better?</p><p>CARTER:  When they could give me an advertisement on what I want why can't  they say, do you want something bad.</p><p>BAKER:  They could.  They could.  But you know what that means.  That means  changing laws.</p><p>MURPHY:  Censorship. </p><p>BAKER:  That's right.  And if they -- </p><p>MURPHY:  You're giving up something for getting something.  I'm not saying  we don't.  I think we should be more aggressive.  But that is a bigger  conversation.</p><p>CARTER:  But giving up a privacy to be told to.

Here's what he told me yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I would rather us do it right than do it  fast because no matter what passes, if it isn't good or it has some  unintended consequence the President is going to be held responsible for  that.

Let's not  repeat the mistakes the Democrats made.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a closer look at the legislative agenda coming up.</p><p>Markets are rallying today, kicking off the week strongly -- Dow  Industrials at the highs of the morning right now up to 75 points.

How's that going to  work?  We will tell you about it. </p><p>First, our top story this half hour right now, tragedy strikes London  again, British authorities now saying a suspect has been detained after a  van plowed into a crowd of worshipers near a Mosque in Northern London  early this morning.  According to London police they are treating this as a  possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at the scene though it's  unclear if his death was actually related to the attack.  Ten others were  wounded, the driver, a 48-year-old man arrested at the scene after being  detained by members of the public.  According to some reports witnesses  said that the driver was heard shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.</p><p>Joining me right now is Counsel to the president, Kellyanne Conway.   Kellyanne, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, U.S. PRESIDENT:  It's a pleasure Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  We've got extra security  measures being taken, people are worried.  Do you expect we'll see extra  security measures taken in the U.S. as a result of what went on in London?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well the president and his counterterrorism team assess this  situation throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were  concerned with their British counterparts and since it looks like the  British government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll  wait to see how that investigation unfolds.</p><p>And where we support our allies anyway that they need, we just don't want  this to become the new normal where people feel like they're changing the  behavior, their lifestyles, their lives indeed Maria and allowing the  terrorists in any form to win and to prevail.  And so we know that people  are very concerned about national security, it's in large part how the  president won.  He just frankly put out the more masculine, more robust  antiterrorism program whether it's (inaudible) strength or him wanting ISIS  to be in retreat.  Hillary Clinton referred to them as our, \"determined  enemies\" at her convention speech so I think there's a huge contrast.  And  you're seeing that play out now where the president is constantly talking  about how his first response really to this nation is our safety and  security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he really did.  And I think that's why it's just a head  scratch as far as why he gets this pushback on the travel ban and  everything else.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are new questions surrounding whether or not the president  is actually under investigation or not by the Special Counsel looking into  Russia's alleged election meddling.  On Friday the president tweeted out  this, \"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who  told me to fire the FBI Director!  Witch Hunt.\"  And then yesterday, a  member of the president's legal team contradicted the tweet.  Kellyanne, is  the president under investigation?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well I don't think Jay Sekulow, the president (inaudible)  contradicting the tweet, I think he explained it.  What Mr. Sekulow said is  that is that the president is constrained by the 140 characters in Twitter.</p><p>The president uses his social media platform to communicate directly with  the people as you know Maria.  But that Jay Sekulow, his per -- one of his  personal lawyers said the president has not been notified that he's under  investigation.  In fact, Mr. Comey testified that the president is not the  president said in the letter where he dismissed Mr. Comey in May, that  Comey had told him three times that he wasn't under investigation, they've  not been notified otherwise.  His personal lawyer would know this.</p><p>And it's important to say that because what the president was reacting to  in that particular social media message was the Washington Post report that  was based on five anonymous seekers, anonymous sources that must have been  leaked that he's somehow under investigation.  His lawyer is saying no he's  not.  So I think he's explaining that the president is really pointing out  the irony of everything and the last part of his tweet is the most  important which is that he consider this to be a witch hunt.</p><p>We've been doing this for many, many months now having an investigation,  where's the collusion?  Where's the obstruction of justice?  Where's the  evidence that supports this conclusion and we have separate, what, five or  six different separate congressional investigations going on and we've been  doing this for eight to nine months, I mean you could have a baby in this  time and they have no evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, I have been very adamant about this as well from the  beginning saying, look, this is a -- it looks like a completely  manufactured story.  Russia has been hacking, it has been undermining the  U.S. and the West for decades, why attach the president to that he has  nothing to do with it?</p><p>However, why respond to the Washington Post do you think Kellyanne?  I mean  the president has rightly so called some of the news out there fake news  and in many cases the president was right, why respond to the Washington  Post?  I mean the idea of tweeting, I understand he's speaking directly to  the American people, people like it and it's been a good strategy for him.   But can you convince him or ask him why he's not tweeting about the agenda?   Why he's not tweeting about other -- why bring up the Russia story and  respond to the Washington Post when this is a news organization he's called  fake news anyway.</p><p>CONWAY:  So here's where everybody has to wake up each morning and make  their own choices.  The media could cover all of his tweets and if they did  that, they would see that he more often tweets about agenda items than  other matters.  </p><p>He has this constant stream on Instagram, on Facebook, on Twitter, his big  social media platform where he says reaches about 100 million people,  Maria.  And you had the entire day in Cuba the other day where he rolled  back these awful rules that Obama put in place that allowed the Cuban  Regime not the Cuban people to benefit financially.  We had the first  meeting at the White House with the Opioid Commission on Friday.  Earlier  in the week the president did workforce development and apprenticeship  week, that's all on Twitter.</p><p>This week he'll be meeting with the -- today he'll be meeting with the tech  CEOs.  Last week he also sign some things into laws and the EOs that  benefit people, benefit workers.  All of that goes on to his Twitter feed  when he has a bilateral.  He's hosted I think more than 20 now with the  White House with foreign leaders but people don't want to cover that, they  want to cover -- they're very selective in the different tweets they want  to cover.  So he -- I'm telling you, the American people see all of the  social media platforms.  They're sort of saying attention saying, \"Wow,  he's going to put all this money and all this force in effect of the White  House behind apprenticeship programs where those who go through at  apprenticeship program the Department of Labor say they get -- they're 90  percent get employed immediately and they make an average of $60,000 per  year.</p><p>So we want to dignify all types of career paths, all types of jobs, the  welders, the hairdressers, the plumbers, the carpenters, people who get a  high school diploma and a skill certificate.  All of that's on the social  media platform, they just don't want to cover it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I think that's a fair point.  I mean, but there is  criticism that the president brings up things that he doesn't really need  to.  I mean does he create some obstacles for himself by bringing up some  of the things that perhaps the supporters don't believe anyway?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well in this case though he -- first of all, he's the president of  all Americans and he made that clear beginning on November 9th and he's  never wavered from that.  </p><p>People who criticize him and even deny that the legitimacy of his  presidency will benefit from his tax cut, they will benefit from better  healthcare, they will be benefit from infrastructure, they will benefit  from ISIS in retreat, they will benefit from the regulatory framework being  chipped away because it's impeding our pocketbook in a personal liberty  issues.  But Maria, the fact that the president feels he has a right to  defend himself on occasion.</p><p>He's watching a one-sided witch hunt as he refers to it because it's not  like if we're in a court of law and you're watching people -- you're  watching one side and it's a prosecution rest and here comes the defense,  it doesn't work that way.  You got Comey testifying without anybody  responding in front of 20 million people.  You've got outlet after outlet  that's still criticizing him that is against him, that's part of the  \"resistance and obstruction.\"  You got an entire democratic party and their  presidential nominee (inaudible)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about what the president could do but let  me get to this because the president has added John Dowd, a veteran lawyer  in Washington to his legal team.  Is the president preparing for a legal  battle?  Is that why he is upping the number of people on the legal team?   Tell us what he's expecting.</p><p>CONWAY:  Well he's always been a prepared man.  He's a very smart  businessman, among the smartest, most successful.  </p><p>And he's just somebody who surrounds himself with the best and the  brightest and he's doing that here as well.  What he's preparing for is  what we already know exist which is this investigation that's ongoing --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The witch hunt is what he calls it.</p><p>CONWAY:  Witch hunt.  But it continues forward for now and he's just  preparing himself for that.  And I know a number of these attorneys and  they're all very talented and they all have different types of expertise.</p><p>And I think the most important thing is that they understand their client  in this case and that they protect him and they avail him of every possible  resource in him defending himself, he has the right to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I think the left has been really driving this  narrative in terms of the Russia probe from the get-go since the president  took office.  What can the president do to keep the team on focus on the  agenda?  </p><p>I mean, yesterday I had on a number of congressman and they blame the  senate for part of the obstructionist.  I mean we've got a healthcare bill  sitting in the senate, a lot of people want to see tax reform this year.   The president has been vocal about it, he wants a 15 percent corporate tax  rate, he's talked about his white paper that he's come out within that  regard but is there anything that the president can do to ensure that they  get something done, the congress passes legislation this year?  Because  Kellyanne, the truth is is, you could take one issue like the travel ban,  they're pushing back there.  You could take another issue like repealing  and replace ObamaCare, pushing back there.  But the real goal of the left  is to take over the house in 2018 and move to impeach President Trump.  How  does he get ahead of that?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well first of all, he has asked for their votes, we would still  love to have democratic votes on healthcare, on tax reform the way  President George W. Bush had 10 or 12 democratic senators in 2001 Maria to  pass his tax cut.</p><p>The democrats -- the senate was controlled by the democrats when President  George W. Bush passed his tax cut.  So we would love to have democratic  vote on infrastructure and any number of these measures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't look like (inaudible) </p><p>CONWAY:  And it doesn't look like they're even interested in governing.   The democrats are interested in politics, the president is interested in  governing and leading and having impact from people's lives.</p><p>So we're always open in getting their votes, where are they?  Why don't  they come to the table and channel some bipartisanship on measures that  affect their constituents as well?  Number two, the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the healthcare  reform.  You know, ObamaCare has been a (inaudible) for over seven years,  the sinking battleships turns slowly and they've got part one through the  House, now the senate will do its work, Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th that's around the corner.  Tax reform later  this year, they're moving towards infrastructure, towards border security,  more of that, the military's got new funding.</p><p>So things are happening and everywhere I go that's what people reflect back  to me, \"Tell the president we see what he's doing, to keep doing it, to not  give up, to knock it in.  We're praying for him, we support him, he's  making the impact on people's lives.\"  So I think the president just has to  have this two front in the one hand keeping an eye on these investigations  that he calls a witch hunt that so far have produced nothing but a waste of  taxpayer dollars --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's expensive.</p><p>CONWAY:  And it's getting really expensive.  We live through this before,  where are the same democrats who complained about previous investigations  that actually did bear fruit where a former president lied under oath and  obstructed justice.  We know what happened there.</p><p>They were -- they complained completely about the waste of taxpayer  dollars, I would up that end up to here.  And then, of course, the  president's main front is passing all this stuff, I work with him every  single day he and his senior team and his cabinet, his vice president  Maria, are forging ahead to create those jobs, to continue to have  confidence in the economy.  You see the small business manufacturing home  builder, consumer confidence numbers, you see the way the markets has  responded to this man's presidency.  He's been there five months tomorrow,  it's only five months.  People feel like things should be going faster and  faster because they know that's Donald Trump's pace.</p><p>But he's up against a Washington that moves much more slowly than he does  but I think the two shall meet.  And there's two paces and there's two ways  of doing business will actually produce -- continue to produce results for  real people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there's no doubt about it the president has been  incredibly successful in terms of rolling back regulations.  Whatever he  can do in terms of executive orders, without the congress, he's been able  to do and it's been very successful.</p><p>But he does face this goal on the left of just obstructing, stop the  agenda.  Chuck Schumer has been very clear.  They don't -- you're not going  to get democratic support.  I mean do you really think you're going to get  democratic support on tax reform or repeal and replace?  No.</p><p>CONWAY:  I feel like if people watch your show should call the democratic  senators and members of congress and say, \"Get on with it now.  Accept the  election results, stop with the resistance and move on to governing, move  on to leading.\"  </p><p>Because the democratic party is in an odd place right now, they had their  true leader, they're all arguing, they don't know what they're governing  philosophy is accepted, the message now is the message wasn't (inaudible)  Maria which is, \"You're terrible and I'm not you.\"  That's not a message,  that's an insult to anyone (inaudible).  But the democrats are stuck  somewhere between not being able to accept the 2016 election results and  being completely focused in the 2018 election results.</p><p>What about 2017?  What about governing?  What about leading?  What about --  you owe it to your constituents to get things done --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see -- yes.  We'll see if the public responds to the  obstructionism come '18.</p><p>CONWAY:  They were (inaudible) did you see the approval ratings?  Chuck  Schumer, the democrat, Pelosi their approval ratings are all much lower  than the president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.  All right.  Today, you've got a very  big meeting at the White House with technology CEOs.</p><p>CONWAY:  Yes, very exciting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The IT of government system is at focus, is that where the  priority is?  What's going to go on at the --  </p><p>CONWAY:  It is indeed.  And President Trump and Jared Kushner, his senior  adviser who runs the Office of American Innovation has been way on top of  this issue from day one.  </p><p>What is it?  We literally have government agencies and cabinets they can't  speak to each other because they have different programs.  And look at what  just happened recently in the last couple of weeks with the Veterans  Affairs Administration, you've got the Department of Defense and Veterans  Affairs literally weren't talking to each other.  So what Jared did is he  invited in the five brightest tech people or five tech experts in DoD, five  from Veterans Affairs and said, \"How can we get this together?\" </p><p>Viola, now we have a system in place where veterans will be treated as one  single patient seamlessly through both of those agencies.  So the idea is  to stop all this waste -- do you realize that LMB just finished with Y2K?   In 2017, do you realize that there are 1,000 different hotlines for  veterans to call the Veterans Affairs?  Do you realize that we spend -- the  average American spends like 30 hours a year on paperwork for the  government?  So we need a government agency that talks to each other and  make it seamless and modernize it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what the goal is today.</p><p>CONWAY:  And we're glad the tech CEOs are coming in to do that.  We know  that they have been incredibly successful, they do this for a living and  we're happy that they're coming to share their best practices with the  president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Kellyanne, good to see you.</p><p>CONWAY:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kellyanne Conway there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The death toll from last week's high-rise fire  in London is continuing to rise.  Cheryl Casone with the details now,  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes Maria, we're getting the numbers  unfortunately London police now says 79 people are now dead or missing  following that terrible fire at Grenfell Tower.  That's up from the last  update that we'd received a 58 dead or missing.</p><p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan says the fire was a preventable accident caused by  years of neglect from the government, their siding materials in that  building.  Local officials have come under heavy criticism for not  providing enough support or information.  So the cause of the fire was  (inaudible) 24 storey building does remain under investigation today but  there had been suggestions the new paneling used in a recent renovation may  have helped the flames move quickly at the outside of the building.  Again,  we're following the story for you out of London this morning.</p><p>We're also got (inaudible) at home Lockheed Martin in the final stages  negotiating a huge deal worth more than $37 billion.  The defense  contractor reportedly going to sell a record 440 F35 fighter jets serve  from 11 nations that does include the U.S.  The final price those jets  expected to be around $85 million.</p><p>And finally this is a way to make sure your child flies for free, give  birth onboard the aircraft.  A baby boy was born yesterday on an India Jet  Airways flight between Saudi Arabia to India.  The flight diverted to  Mumbai after a mom went into labor.  Luckily, a trained nurse was onboard,  and crew, and, of course, the passengers as well helped deliver that baby.   The airline has given the little boy Maria a free lifetime pass as a  birthday gift.  He flies for free for life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Thank you so much Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Brooks Koepka, how about that, swinging into the  history books this weekend with his first major championship.  The winner  of the U.S. Open, we've got all the highlights for a wild end for that  Open, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We have another first time winner of the major  championship in golf to report.  The U.S. Open wrapped up yesterday in  Wisconsin, we were happy to be there last week.  Jared Max with all the  highlights, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.  Seven straight major  won by a golfer who never won a major before.</p><p>27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka did in a record setting fashion.  All  tied up on the scoreboard with just six holes to go, Brian Harman now enter  Sunday lead to get minus 12 but fell apart with a couple of lay bogies on  12 and 13 as he was fall -- he would fall a couple of shots behind.  While  Brooks Koepka would to everything he needed to do.  Late in the tournament,  Koepka had birdies on 14, 15, and 16, eventually we would go to the 18th  hole and Brooks Koepka would manage to get in there for a birdie.  He  finishes at 16-under par, that ties Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest  score in relation to par at a U.S. Open.  Good for a check yesterday of  $2.16 million, that's the largest earning in one day in golf history,  congratulations to the 27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka.  </p><p>Last August, Kyle Larson earned his first career NASCAR victory at Michigan  International Speedway by beating out his friend Chase Elliot.  Yesterday,  Kyle Larson did it again.  In the target car, 15 laps to go at the  (inaudible) 400.  Larson would take advantage of a restart and claim the  lead from Kyle Bush and then with about 10 laps to go, you see Ryan  Blaney's care malfunctions, causes a pileup, Daniel Suarez gets clipped, he  runs in down (inaudible) into the wall.  Final laps though, Kyle Larson  scores his third career win and second of the season and celebrates with  his son on Father's Day.</p><p>All right.  So the Warriors lost the NBA title last year and then they  signed Kevin Durant and then they beat the Cavaliers for the championship  this year.  So now it's the Cavaliers turn to make a splash, right?  Well  according to Yahoo's Vertical, the Cavaliers received a phone call this  weekend from the Indiana Pacers who wanted to know if they might be  interested in making a trade for All Star Paul George who reportedly told  the team he will opt out of his contract in 2018 to become an unrestricted  free agent.  Paul George average nearly 24 points gain for the Pacers and  he is also friends with Lebron James back in April.  Lebron posted this on  Instagram saying, \"Nothing but love and respect.  Love the battle last  night bro.  I'm glad to see you back where you belong\" and includes this  hashtag #youngking because Lebron is king.  So maybe this is the beginning  of a recruiting process, Paul George, what a talented player, he's beaten a  bad injury, his back, so Cleveland would have to give up an arm and a leg  together.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was going to say, who are they  going to give up?</p><p>MAX:  Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love maybe.</p><p>BAKER:  You can't give up Kyrie.  No, no.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Paul George is no Kevin  Durant.  </p><p>MAX:  Correct.  Very few people are.  </p><p>BAKER:  Do you think Erin Hills is going to take -- that was the first  time they hosted the Open, are they going to take any heat for the  (inaudible)?</p><p>MAX:  Yes because the scores were way too strong.  We had more I  believe -- there were more scores under par yesterday than -- in this  tournament than we ever have in history as far as U.S. Open, so it wasn't  strong enough.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting if that's the case.  It was a long course,  they walked nine miles versus an average six miles on other course.</p><p>Let me ask you this, you got to explain this story to me, the Olympic  swimmer Michael Phelps has a new rival.  Phelps is going to face off  against El Great White Shark for a reality series on the Discovery Channel.   It's unclear how they're going to be raising against one another but it  will air during the Discovery Channel Shark Week, what do you make of this?</p><p>MAX:  Michael Phelps swims at best six miles per hour, a great white goes  twenty miles per hour.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what's the point?</p><p>MAX:  So I don't know how -- maybe -- somebody said maybe if Phelps gets a  head start, he starts first and then the shark coming after him maybe he  can get the seven miles an hour.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  (inaudible) the sharks chasing him, let's see how fast he  goes then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There will be some protective situation where he's in like a  tunnel of some sort.  I don't know, how are they going to do it.</p><p>MAX:  Maybe.  He's going to need a bigger boat.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Swim in a cage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to watch Discovery Channel for that one.   Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX:  Thanks Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared Max.

Rosecliff  Chief Executive Officer, Mike Murphy is here.  And Diligence President,  Mike Baker.  Good to see you everybody.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Really important conversation today, we're going to talk  about London, a fourth terrorist attack.  And in that meeting at the White  House Mike, I know you want to talk a lot about technology as well.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lot to get to this morning.  And coming up joining the  conversation this morning, the Adviser to President Trump, KellyAnne Conway  is joining us this morning.  So we're going to get into all of the above  with KellyAnne Conway when she joins us, coming up.</p><p>But first, terror strike in London again this morning.  British authority  say that the suspect has been detained as a van plowed into a crowd of  worshipers near a mosque in North London early this morning.  According to  London police, they are treating it as a possible act of terrorism.  One  man found dead at the scene though it is unclear if his death was related  to the attack.  At least 10 others were wounded.  The driver, a 48-year-old  man arrested at the scene after being detained by members of the public.   Video of the moment showed a Caucasian man being detained by police.   According to some reports, witnesses said that the driver was heard  shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.  Mike Baker, what do you make of this  attack?</p><p>BAKER:  Well I think the London authorities are right when they say, \"Look,  you got to condemn extremism no matter what it is.  This is not rocket  science.</p><p>A van drove in to a crowd of Muslims coming out of Mosque, it's Ramadan so  they're coming out, it's about a quarter twenty after midnight and so we  don't have to sit in angst and think too much about what this was all  about.  This is anger welling up from the recent attacks most likely that  had taken place in London whether the concert bombing or London in  Westminster Bridge attacks.  So --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess you look at the facts that it's four attacks in just  three months and try to put together the similarities as if it's ISIS  related but this doesn't seem to be that.</p><p>BAKER:  No, this is not.  Again, I don't -- I'm not one to sit and over  think something like this.  We just have to look at it, be pragmatic,  understand what it is and this is a response to what's been happening and  it's wrong and you can't -- what -- people always talk about sort of this  equivalency.  </p><p>\"Oh, if you talk like that or if you do drone campaigns then you lower  yourself to the level of the terrorist.\"  With the drones, I don't think  that's the case, I've never had a problem in operations in counterterrorism  differentiating myself from the bad guys.  But when something like this  happens, it does.  It's on the same level, you're attacking people coming  out their place of worship, you can't do it.</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean it's got to be a really scary time to live in London  because you have so many recent attacks and then there -- I'm sure there  are more people like this looking to respond to those attacks.</p><p>So you look back at all the people that they brought in to London and how  they let them branch off into little areas, pockets of their own  communities and it's got to be a really scary place to live right now.</p><p>BAKER:  Well it's a real divisiveness and you're absolutely right.  To  point out with this whole concept of multiculturalism that has developed  over decades now.</p><p>In the U.K. and now across the E.U. where the idea was, you don't  necessarily -- it was no effort to integrate within the society.  Celebrate  where you came from, celebrate your own culture.  Well that has created  this problem, this is a self inflicted wound to some degree and how they  resolve it, well in the immediate aftermath, they have to do what they're  doing which is Theresa May and all the other leaders have to come out,  condemn it, denounce, show transparency and a quick response just like they  would with any other attack.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But also push this idea that we will clamp down on any  extremism which they haven't done.  As you say, they're allowing people to  live in this no-go areas practice Sharia Law.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  The no-go thing is -- it's complicated, it's not quite the  narrative that has built up over a period of time now where somehow these  are (inaudible) police can't go in there, they go in there, they can go in  there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even in Paris?</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, even in Paris.  The problem is, it's not so much you have  access to go in there, the problem is developing communication.  And I know  this is going to sound touchy-feely at some 30,000 foot level but I'm  talking from an operational perspective.</p><p>You have to get into this communities, develop some level of trust in  communication in order so that when they see somebody, an immediate family  member, this is the only way you stop some of these folks is that the mom  or the cousin or the brother picks up the phone and has the ability to call  the local authorities.  So the no-go area is more of a tactical operation  which is no communication within these communities.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I do think this is a global issue though.  I mean we're  looking at London and what's happening right now in London.  Paris for a  while was the focus.</p><p>Here we've had -- even here in United States we've had so many issues.   This is global percolating -- percolation as a result I believe of ISIS --  as the result of this attack.  And so I think --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think is okay to do.</p><p>CARTER:  Well exactly.  When I think what -- this would have been an  opportunity for Theresa May I think to really regain confidence and she  hasn't really stepped up into that level.</p><p>And so I think it's really important right now that our world leaders step  up to the table and everybody says, \"Look, we're on the same page here,  let's stop with the blame game, let's just keep moving things forward and  let's start fresh.  There's so many opportunities right now on so many  things that we agree on, enough is enough let's move forward.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  Meanwhile, in Washington today, President  Trump meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White  House.  </p><p>This is the inaugural meeting of what they're calling \"The American  Technology Council.\"  Take a look at some of the leaders that are going to  be present there, the CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos will be there, as well as  Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, Tim Cook from Apple, IBM's Ginni Rommetty  just to name a few.  Mike Murphy, what do you make of this?  This is the  Trump Administration trying to update its IT they say.</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know how you can find a negative in this.  So Trump feels  like we need to serve the American people better with better technology so  he goes out and he gets the top people from the field of technology in the  world to advise him on it.  So I think -- and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What's wrong with that?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's the exact, right way to handle it and I think anybody  who doesn't show up or chooses not to show up is just showing a lack of  openness because you can debate.  </p><p>We can have different views on things but if I'm an expert in a certain  field and you're leading the country, you want to hear from me, you need to  hear from me.  So I think anybody who shows up there, it doesn't mean they  necessarily support President Trump, it means they support the United  States of America and I think it's a great thing that he's doing, I think  it's a great thing all of these people are doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to modernize the IT system of the U.S. is exactly what we  need by the way.  We're just looking at pictures of the president and the  first lady coming off of the plane from Camp David, the spent the weekend  in Camp David, Lee Carter.  He tweeted out that it was an honor to be there  as well.</p><p>CARTER:  I think that the American people are really glad to see him doing  these kinds of things.  I think they were -- there's a lot of criticism  spending time at his own property and I think people want to see President  Trump acting presidential doing a lot of the activities that they're used  to and I think there's something comforting about seeing him here.</p><p>I think it's also nice to see Barron in the picture too and enjoying  himself taking selfies being -- it's very, very human.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's being a kid.</p><p>CARTER:  Being a kid, yes.  </p><p>BAKER:  I wouldn't want to be a kid coming off of the Marine1.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I would have taken a selfie.  All right.  Let's talk  about the agenda for a second because senate republicans are working hard  to finalize their bill to replace ObamaCare.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he hopes to bring the bill  to the floor within the next two weeks.  Yesterday, I spoke with Senator  Marco Rubio he said the process will likely take a little longer.  Here's  what he told me on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) FLORIDA:  I think healthcare will happen this year,  tax reform we'll see.  We're working on that now, there's a component of it  that I'm working with Ivanka Trump on where there's the pro family  component of it and in fact we'll have a meeting this week with her and a  number of senators and house members to begin to layout that portion of the  agenda.</p><p>But I do think tax reform, these things can work simultaneously.  You don't  have to wait to finish on healthcare before you start formulating ideas on  tax reform and that's happening right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well I would expect the questions to really ramp up certainly  this week after what happened last week.  Steve Scalise is still on the  hospital obviously.  His condition was downgraded from a critical to  serious condition.  But do you worry about where the agenda stands now in  terms of tax reform and healthcare reform?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it seems like as if people after what happened last week,  people want to work together.  So hopefully, this was a bottom as far as  the divisiveness in Washington and now people can come together, put both  sides on the table and reach an agreement.</p><p>BAKER:  What I don't understand and maybe I'm just speaking this average  simpleton, when Marco Rubio says, \"You don't have to wait to start ideas on  tax reform\" why weren't the republicans doing this two years ago?  Why  didn't -- when they had this opportunity and they stepped in, they didn't  open the drawer, pull out their plan and say, \"Here it is, here's our tax  reform\" because that would have been the time to do this and not now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They repeal and replace.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.  I don't understand how Washington works, maybe that's as  simple as that.  I -- it's dysfunctional.</p><p>CARTER:  I think America does that's why Donald Trump is president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I will say this, there is a feeling the leadership says  continually that they are having meetings on tax reform right now just what  Marco Rubio just said that they are doing this behind the scenes in hopes  of getting this done this year.  Are you still a believer that they're  going to get something done?</p><p>CARTER:  I'm always an optimist and I hope they're going to get something  done.  I would love to see them say, \"We're going to work through the  summer break right now to get it done for the American people\" because  that's what they should do.  They made a promise, they should keep it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or they will do healthcare before July 4th which seems  incredible or maybe they get something out and then they do tax reform  after the summer, I don't know.  Two weeks.</p><p>CARTER:  It's just two weeks, yes.</p><p>BAKER:  They need the big legislative win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They do.</p><p>BAKER:  They have to have that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They really do.  We'll take a short break we've got a lot of  conversations on deck this morning.</p><p>Coming up in Colorado, some kids may go back to using a landline.  Why one  group is looking to ban the sale of cell phones for children under 13.</p><p>Then Brooks Koepka wins the U.S. Open, gaining his first ever major  championship victory.  We've got all the highlights from the big open, back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A navy jet has shot down a Syrian warplane.   Cheryl Casone with the details now, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Maria.  Well a U.S.  navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian government warplane after it attacks  Washington best fighters near Raqqa.</p><p>This is according to statement from U.S.-led coalition, the coalition said  in that statement that the shoot down was in accordance with rules of  engagement and a number of (inaudible) fighters were wounded in the attack.   Fox News is reporting the Super Hornet that shot down the jet was based  onboard the USS George H.W. Bush which is currently operating in the  Mediterranean Sea.  </p><p>Meanwhile here at home, Colorado is considering banning preteens from  owning cell phones.  Residents in favor, the campaign say that kids under  13 years of age spend too much time on their phone.  Under proposed law,  cell phone retailers will be required to ask the age of the primary cell  phone user before it's sold, parents would not be allowed to buy phones for  their kids that are under the age of 13.  Retailers would face a $500 fine  if they don't comply with this one.</p><p>And Cars 3 sped, get it, into the number one spot at the box office over  the weekend.  This is the 16th Pixar film to debut at number one.  They  brought in $53.5 million that beat the recording breaking Wonder Woman we  should say over the weekend but she is still a force to reckon with Maria,  that moving topping $570 million worldwide.</p><p>And a big in tournament, Brooks Koepka, the golfer coming out on top at the  U.S. Open this weekend.  He won his first major championship, he finished  16 under matching Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest rating score to par  at a U.S. open.  Koepka now the third American to win the U.S. Open in a  row following Dustin Johnson last year and during the (inaudible) in 2015.   Maria, I watch the show that looks like you had a great time at the U.S.  Open.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is beautiful.  We really did enjoyed.  It was great Cheryl.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the -- as U.S. authorities consider expanding a ban  for carryon laptops, airlines are faking the consequences.  How a broader  ban could affect you with the airport, coming up.</p><p>Then one American businessman, $5 billion away from overtaking Bill Gates  as the world's richest person, we'll tell you who it is next, back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos coming closer to  becoming the world's richest man after the company announced the Whole  Foodss deal on Friday, Amazon shares soared adding nearly $2 billion to  Bezos' net worth.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, one firm says that the bidding for  Whole Foodss may only be getting underway -- just beginning to get  underway.  Joining us right now is Kingsview Asset Management Chief  Investment Officer, Scott Martin.  Scott, good to see you.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Hey  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What an incredible deal.  When we first heard that deal on  Friday, what do you say?  My instinct was, they're taking over the world,  Amazon, I mean it's pretty incredible.  What were your thoughts?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I was shocked.  I mean Amazon now wants to control your  grocery aisle.  And you know what's interesting Maria too, I think there's  a couple of things going on with this deal, first of all, it's been rumored  and it came together at a very last minute.  </p><p>In fact, Amazon was only supposedly working on this deal for a matter of  weeks which maybe speaks to your point about this just begins the whole  negotiation process with respect to this deal but as far as the grocery  aisle goes, this isn't a great business.  If you look at the grocery in the  last several years, consumers are becoming more discerning, profit margins  are lowering at the grocers.  So what exactly Amazon's going to do to the  grocery aisle and do how you shop for your groceries is going to be  interesting with respect to the big reach they have now with Amazon Prime  and some of the other things they're doing at the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean look, people saw the deal, Mike Murphy, and they  thought, \"Wow, this is an incredible combination, they bid up the stocks  but the grocery business not such an easy business, that's number one.  And  number two is this may not be so easy to take it over, the journalist  reporting the Neuberger Berman might be a bidder, that there's a new  process that other bids will come in.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I can see anyone coming into bid against Bezos and Amazon.   They have --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And paying more than $13 billion.</p><p>MURPHY:  Because if you do bid it up, I think Bezos, he obviously wants the  company, he can go in and bid above them, it's going to be hard to compete.   I mean maybe a Walmart could go in and try to compete but I don't really  see that.</p><p>I think Whole Foodss is going to be acquired by Amazon and it's a low  margin business, it's not a great business to be in but I think Bezos is  thinking two or three steps ahead.  I think he's thinking about using all  the Whole Foods stores over 400 stores nationwide as fulfillment centers,  as processing centers, as warehouses.  I think he's seeing all the Whole  Foods customers, the affluent customers as Amazon members.  Remember,  Amazon stock popped on Friday on this news, it went up and increased more  market value than the entire purchase price that they're paying for Whole  Foods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p>MURPHY:  So I think right now the market's betting on Bezos and thinking  Bezos is going to figure this out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about all the other supermarket companies that all sold  off?  I mean everybody was worried it.  You look at Kroger, you look at the  other supermart companies and -- I mean what was that all about?  Do you  think people were just nervous?</p><p>MURPHY:  It was Kroger, it was Walmart, it was all of the supermarket  companies just thinking that Amazon is getting in here now, they're going  to do what they did in e-commerce.  They're going to just crush margins,  they can afford to lose money for a number of years.  So therefore they  could really put a ton of pressure on all the other grocers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MURPHY:  But I there's potential there because I think there'll be more  consolidation amongst the other place.</p><p>BAKER:  Well Whole Foods been having problems for some time now, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They needed help.</p><p>BAKER:  And I wonder to what degree this might be in part a strategic shot  at Walmart, you mentioned Walmart.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, big -- I mean it's a big part of it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  Yes.  And remember, an activist hedge funds came in and took  a big stake, almost a 10 percent stake in Whole Foods Jana Partners and  they were putting a lot of pressure on the board to do something, that  definitely had something to do with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey Scott, jump in here.  What about -- then there's the Yahoo  story as well, end of an era, officially becoming Altaba as it starts  trading under a new name, Yahoo becomes Altaba.  Do you think the company  will be able to turn around now that the Verizon deal is done?</p><p>MARTIN:  You know it's interesting Maria, when you look at Yahoo in the  last say six to twelve months and those shareholders that waited around for  this end of the Marissa Mayer deal even or the era of Marissa Mayer, that  actually got reward to shareholders because that's really one of the other  thing that I think the company is seeing moving forward but I'll tell you  what's interesting as far as Yahoo and ramping this back in the Amazon, i  mean Amazon is taking over the internet too.</p><p>I mean you look at Amazon web services, you look at all the reach that they  have now with their website and their apps, I mean a lot of these companies  that are trying to compete with Amazon whether it is in the grocery aisle,  whether it is online are really losing this battle and as I think what Mike  pointed out, Amazon is willing to go into these markets wherever it is and  lose money just to get consumers and customers just to be beat out the  competition.</p><p>CARTER:  I mean I also think though -- and I'm really curious to what you  think about this, is, is that there was some kind of a status symbol  associated with being able to afford to go to Whole Foods and what -- and I  think there's an opportunity for some of these brands to really step up and  sort of that niche that experience but they are going to have to adopt with  the time.  Do you think that there's any other brand that's going to be  able to comment and take that place?  I'm kind of wondering if the Whole  Foods brand is going to become water down now.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  Well I'm seriously worried about.  And that the curious  part, I mean I'm concerned about this deal from a standpoint of and Mike  brought it up.</p><p>If he turns these into the fulfillment centers and warehouses, then what  happens?  I mean -- because I agree the -- exactly.  The Whole Foods  experience is really good.  You know what happens Maria around in Chicago,  they just have a new one that's by my house, you go there, you shop, you  have a couple of beers in the bar, you maybe watch the game.  I mean that  maybe go away now and I think that's what's interesting about this deal for  Amazon that they're making for Whole Foods, do they want to take away that  experience because to me that's the value of the shopping experience at  Whole Foods.</p><p>BAKER:  Best line I heard over the weekend was Bezos to pay cash for Whole  Foods.  Who pays cash at Whole Foods?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.  That's the best joke ever.</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Best joke ever.  Go ahead Scott, you want to react?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I mean -- well you can't afford to pay cash at Whole Foods  that's why I'm a company man because if you don't have enough cash to go in  there that's why the plastic is so good.</p><p>And that's the other thing, Amazon Prime is one of the best let's say  gateway drugs in the planet with respect to what Amazon Prime does for  those who actually ends up going on Amazon and just buying more stuff  because they're Prime members.  It's similar demographic to who does shop  at Whole Foods, so there's some cross over there but how they change them  and how they manipulate that into really big sales is the question that I  have on my mind today but something that Bezos I think is going to answer  in the next couple of years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  Scott real quick, markets  are up today, you put new money to work or no?  Are you pulling back?</p><p>MARTIN:  No, I'm putting money to work Maria.  In fact, I love the tech  sector, they've beaten down the last couple of weeks because of investors  getting nervous.  That's been weak money, I think strong money is going to  come back in here towards the end of the quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  You agree with that Mike Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY:  I do completely.  It's opportunity here.  Market, there's a bit  under the markets goes higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tough first quarter for tech.  All right.  Scott, good to see  you sir.  Thank you. </p><p>MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, British Prime Minister Theresa May in the spotlight  this morning as formal negotiations for Brexit are underway.  How the  European Union is expected to respond as Britain moves to exit, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: Welcome  back!  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 19th, your top stories right now  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London is on edge, once again this morning.   At least one person has been killed and several others injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in north London; police are treating  this as a terrorist attack.  Meanwhile, Britain also focused on  negotiations for its exit from the European Union; those talks begin today  in Brussels.  We've got a lot at what's at stake.  The possibility of a  laptop ban as airlines scrambling, what it would mean for your trip to the  airport?  </p><p>And markets are rallying this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a  gain of 60 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average today at the open;  NASDAQ, strong by 35.  In Europe, markets are up across the board.  Take a  look at the indices in the Eurozone with the FTSE 100, up one-half of one  percent; and the CAC40 and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  In Asia,  overnight, mostly higher as you see across the board, actually; Nikkei  Average in Japan up two-thirds of a percent; Hang Seng Index and Hong Kong  up better one percent.  </p><p>And the Southwest facing blazing hot triple digit temperatures today,  that's not keeping tourist away though, in fact, they are flocking to Death  Valley.  We will tell you all about it.  Amazon and Wal-Mart on a collision  course for sure now, Wal-Mart announcing its own deal; what the competition  means for the company is coming up.  And the Vice President getting an  extra special Father's Day present; the Pence family welcome two new furry  members: a kitten and a puppy.  All of those stories coming up this  morning.  </p><p>First, our top stories this half an hour: Britain has been rocked by a  tragedy yet again.  London police are investigating a possible terrorist  attack outside of a mosque late last night.  Investigators say that a 40- year-old man rammed a van into a crowd injuring ten people, at least.  One  man was found dead at the scene; it is unclear, however, if that death is  related to this attack.  Prime Minister, Theresa May, is planning to hold  an emergency meeting on the case later today.  </p><p>Joining us right now: the Wall Street Journal U.K. and Brexit Editor,  Stephen Fidler.  Steven, good to have you, thanks so much for joining us.   I want to get to Britain exiting the E.U. in a moment, but first, this is  the fourth major attack in the U.K. since March; what is your reaction?  </p><p>STEPHEN FIDLER, WALL STREET JOURNAL AND BREXIT EDITOR:  Well, I think it's  certainly a surprise than worried people here.  And I think there's an  extra air of uncertainty, not only with these attacks but with the building  fire last Wednesday.  So, London, in particular, I think is feeling this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a feeling that things need to change in terms of  security?  I mean, how are people feeling in terms of why this is  happening, why London has been under such attack just in the last three  months or so?</p><p>FIDLER:  Well, I think the - I think there is a sense that things need to  change, and there is a question that obviously the security services have  in terms of what they're going to do to deal with people who appear radical  but don't necessarily appear set of violence, you know, what to do to stop  these people going into violence.  So, that's one thing; I think there'll  be a lot of community policing and these kinds of things.  So, I would say,  you know, London has noticed this, but I was down at Borough Market despite  those attacks on London Bridge a week or so ago on Friday, and the place  was just teeming with people.  I mean, it's a - you know, London isn't  shutting down in any sense.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  I'm curious what the political  environment is like there?  Here in the U.S., people say enough with the  partisanship.  It seems like the U.K. is having a very, very similar  experience right now.  And I'm just curious how people are looking at  Theresa May, and is she going to be able to lead us through this?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think you hit on something there.  I think there is a lot of  political uncertainty, particularly given what the election result was last  - a couple weeks ago.  In a sense that she expected to come with an  increased majority; we expected to have a stronger government, and in many  ways, we have a weaker one, she doesn't even have a majority in the House  Commons.  And it looks like she's kind of uncertain in handling a lot of  these things.  You know, she hasn't been very adept at adjusting to and  dealing with the crisis as they've come one after the other.  So, I think,  you know, there is the sense of the government is, you know, not reacting  to this very well, and that she, in particular, is struggling to cope with  all of the things on her plate, you know, including the Brexit negotiation  which is starting today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIVE:  Stephen, you  just something, I think is very important, you just referred to community  policing when you talk about how we try to get ahead of the curve here.  To  what degree do you think the Met Police, or MI-5, or others had had or  having success in developing some line of communication within the Muslim  communities here in the U.K?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think they've done that.  Obviously, they'll be looking at  what's happened and figure they haven't done it will enough, and it's one  of those things that's come into the political debate here which is whether  the cutbacks that have taken place in terms of government spending since  the financial crisis certainly have reduced the numbers of policemen and  reduced the numbers of police on the streets.  So, that sends at the  political debate with the Labour Party saying, you know, this is a  consequence of the conservative policies that there aren't as many police  on the street as they used to be in, and the community policing that used  to go on five years ago or so, isn't happening to the same degree now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to be watching that.  That's a really  important point to bring up.  Let me switch gears and ask you about talks  officially underway now for Britain to leave the European Union; what are  you expecting here, Stephen, in terms of David Davis-the Brexit Secretary- meeting with the E.U.'s Chief Negotiator in Brussels; that meeting  happening right now.  David said that you're determined to build a strong  partnership.  Listen to this; I want to get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, BREXIT SECRETARY:  There's more that unites us than divides  us.  So, while we were ghastly to be, challenging times ahead of us in the  negotiations, we will do all we can to assure that we deliver that works in  the best interest of all citizens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there are concerns that Prime Minister  Theresa May's government is too fragile when she the majority in the snap  election two weeks ago.  Their growing calls for her to drop her plan of  the hard exit out of the E.U.; what are your thoughts here?  How does this  play out?  </p><p>FIDLER:  Well, it's a - I think a when Theresa May called an election in  April, there was a feeling in Europe, in Brussel that, OK, we're going to  have a stronger leader in the U.K. that can deliver on the promises she  makes in the negotiations.  So, that hasn't happened.  So, I think on the  other side of the, you know, from European Union perspective, there is sort  of, you know, a lot questions about who they're dealing, and whether this  woman is going to be in charge six months from now, and whether they should  make concessions in negotiations with someone who might not be around for a  very long.  </p><p>And on the other hand, as you say, in the U.K., she less able to deliver on  the promises, you know, because the House of Commons is divided, as some of  their own party don't want the kind of hard  Brexit.  And you know, it's  possible that the House of Commons or the House of Lords, which is the  unelected second chamber could overturn a lot of what she's trying to do.   So, I think we're entering these negotiations only 21 months to go before  the U.K. leaves the E.U. in a very uncertain situation.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF VENTURES FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Stephen,  it's Mike Murphy, I would think of these recent attacks that's in the U.K.  that the people who are going to be voting would want to be more for  Brexit, so that they could kind of control their borders, and maybe be  safer as a group.  Do you see that gaining any momentum kind of the pro- Brexit crowd because of the recent attacks?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I don't see that as a - the opinion polls don't seem to show that.   I mean, there is an element of that in the discussions.  I mean, you know,  even in the European Union, the UK. could - you know, they're always  possible controls from other people coming in for the U.K.  So, it's not  quite true to say the U.K. didn't control these borders.  What it had an  issue with was people coming into, and working in the U.K. from other parts  of the European Union, and the U.K. could say, quote his answer.  So, I  think there's a slightly different questionnaire, and I think from the  other side of the coin is the state of the British economy.  I mean, the  pound fell very sharply after the referendum last year.  Inflation is  starting to feed through, and people are fighting their standard of living  being eroded.  So, maybe that the sorts of an anti-Brexit crowd are kind of  getting a little more growing, somewhat, because of concerns about the  economy.  </p><p>BAKER:  Stephen, Mike Baker here again, do you feel that comment of David  Davis is correct when he said that there's more that unites the U.K. with  U.E. and then divides you?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think there's a -- there's a sense in both - in which both sides  want a good deal out of this.  I don't think it's in any - nobody thinks  it's in their interest, but this all blows up and that's a sort of a big  break, or at least very few people think that's a - that's a great idea.   So, I think that's true.  I think that the thing that's left unsaid and  really that the U.K. hasn't held its answer is what actually do they  (INAUDIBLE) from this new relationship.  And certainly, some of the things  that they've outlined don't seem to be likely to be agreed on the other  side.  So, I think the - actually, the E.U. said much more about what it's  -- how it's going to approach the negotiations than the U.K. - than the  U.K. has.  There are a lot of unanswered questions about what the U.K.  really is looking for out of all of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen, then new developments in France, newly elected  President, Emanuel Macron consolidating power.  His party obviously winning  a clear majority in parliament overnight what does this victory mean for  the E.U.?</p><p>FIDLER:  It's interesting because it's contrast very much with what's going  on in the U.K., where you have - you have a leadership that is weakened.   Now, we've had this guy coming almost from nowhere in a year, creating a  political movement, becoming the President of France and gaining a huge  majority in the parliament to push through the kind of things that he said  he wants to do, which is including reforming the French slave market.  So,  I think the narrative in which the U.K. went into the sort of referendum  which was a declining European Union and sort of strengthening Britain.   That sort of - that kind of mood music has changed because I think the --  to some extent, anyway, and I wouldn't want to exaggerate this, the E.U.  has got its mojo back partly thanks to, what, some Macron who was a very  pro-E.U. candidate is doing, and also the fact that Angela Merkel looks as  if she's going to come back as chancellor, possibly with, you know,  increased majority or an increased size of her party.</p><p>So, in a sense, you know, it looks like the E.U. is sort of moving forward  to an extent that we didn't expect a year ago.  I mean, Macron's problem is  going to be not in the parliament now.  The question is going to be, what  happens in the streets?  How are they going to react?  The trade unions and  others, how are they going to react to what he's trying to do in the labor  market and to reform the economy?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's an important point, and that obviously becomes  clearer over the months and days to come.  Stephen, great to get your  insights.  Thanks so much.  Stephen Fidler joining us this morning in  London.</p><p>FIDLER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Boeing takes flight with a new plane.  How the  jetliner could rub up competition against rival, Airbus.  Stock has been on  fire of Boeing.  Then, Vice President Mike Pence ads some four-legged  friends to his family.  Their cute new pet social media debut, straight  ahead.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher this morning.  Take a  look at Futures indicating a pretty good rally at the opening of trading.   68 points higher on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  We're watching a  couple of names for you.  Boeing unveiled its first new jet in four years.   The company will develop a bigger 737.  Boeing says 10 customers have  already committed to buying that plane.  The announcement coming at the  Paris air show as the jetmaker looks to take on rising competition from  Airbus.</p><p>We are watching the banks this morning, including JPMorgan Chase.  The  Federal Reserve is set to release the latest result of the stress test  beginning Thursday this week.  Investors are hoping that the banks will get  approval to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends.  And U.S.  Airlines gearing up for the possibility of an expanded ban of carryon  laptops.  Cheryl Casone on that detail right now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria, we were thinking  that we might get news like this.  So, that initial ban that was put into  effect in May by the U.S. and the U.K. did affect some flights from the  Middle East and North Africa.  A ban now under consideration by the Trump  administration would involve flights originating for as many as 71 airports  around the world.  Big expansion.  That would mean additional security  checks and most likely a lot of angry international customers.  </p><p>Well, we're watching an extreme heat wave happening right now as out in the  southwest, parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah all really  suffering.  Temperatures expected to climb well above 110 degrees this week  in several parts of that region.  Death Valley, that's the hottest place in  America could see, get this, 124 degrees tomorrow.  And we are told that  some tourists actually finding to go there to experience Death Valley in  124 degrees.  No, not a smart idea.  </p><p>All right.  Another headlines this morning.  Good God.  Wal-Mart is going  shopping for an online retailer.  The company - this actually went down on  Friday, Maria, is buying Bonobos, they sell men's clothing for $310 million  in cash.  Now, this deal coming as Wal-Mart takes on Amazon for the future  of retail, and of course, it's on the same date that Amazon announced the  big deal, of course, to buy whole foods.  Wal-Mart has been moving  aggressively to try and transform himself into a major e-commerce power.   They bought jet.com last year for more than $3 billion (AUDIO GAP) today as  you could see on your chart under pressure, though, this morning.</p><p>And then, Vice President Mike Pence celebrated Father's Day by adding two  new members to the family.  The Pences welcomed a new kitten and dog into  their home.  The V.P.'s daughter, Charlotte, posted pictures of the new  addition, Charlie and Hazel.  They replaced the Pence's beagle, Maverick,  who died shortly before for the election.  And then (INAUDIBLE) of a cat,  Oreo, who passed away earlier this month.  They joined Pickles, another  family cat, by the way.  And they also have a bunny, Maria, named Marilyn  Van Dough.  They love (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Marilyn, Hazel, Pickles.  I love it.  I love it. </p><p>CARTER:  I always trust people who - I always trust people who love animals  more than those that's -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me, too.  That's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are on this story, ladies and gentlemen.  For all  new Mike Pence pet news, you (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of pets.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  fighting crime and making a return on your investment at the same time.   Why superhero comic books are trending at the auction block.  We'll tell  you about it, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  May 2017 was a win for comic books with $48.2  million worth of merchandise ordered.  This after comic book sales had a  20-year sales record last August who was (INAUDIBLE) by the success of both  the Marvel and D.C. Film Universes.  Joining me right now is  ComicConnect.com COO, Vincent Zurzolo.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much  for being here.</p><p>VINCENT ZURZOLO, COMICCONNECT.COM CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your auction of nearly 18,000 comics just closed last  night.  How did it go?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  We had a record week last week.  Closed from Monday through  Friday last week, and preauction estimated were $4 to $5 million.  We broke  $7 million on the auction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  We can make the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think is behind this obsession with comic books  that we have.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Well, I think people are very nostalgic and they're trying to  recapture the happiest times of their life, their childhood.  But I also  think it has a lot to do with the - that comic books have become  commodities.  They are all encapsulated in hard plastic holders from CGC  grading company which is the world's largest grading company.  And they are  encapsulated in these comic book holders, and it makes people who don't  know how to grade a comic book makes them able to buy and sell comic books.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because actually we're looking - I  was thinking, yes, there is that, that we want to relive our childhood, and  I'm thinking, \"Well, that's really wholesome, right?\"  But some comics are  not wholesome.  I've seen a lot of comics.  My husband likes comic books.   And some of these comic books get serious.  I mean, it's not so wholesome.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Well, they're not all for little kids.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Exactly.  Like my husband.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  You know, so there are - there you go.  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what is the attraction, do you think?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  So, I think it's nostalgia, I think it's this idea that you -  it's a form of entertainment, it's escapism, it's a form of investing.   People are not so in love with - I think nowadays ever since the recession,  traditional forms of investment.  They have to have - become their own type  of investor.  So, they look at things they love, tangible assets like  vintage comic books.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And one of them that you brought in was the comic in which  Superman appears for the second time.  Let's look at that one here.  How  much does that one go for at all?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  This comic book, the second cover appearance of Superman went for  $188,000.  What's important about this is, this is the court case copy.   This was used when D.C. Comics sued Fox who had made an intimation Superman  back in the 40s, 30s and 40s.  And -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's show that one.  That's this one right here.  Yes.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Because if you the stamp, the court case stamp.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is the court case stamp.  Wow.  Because they made a  Superman -</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes, Wonderman who was kind of a rip off from Superman.  But this  is the comic book that sold for the most in our auction is the first  appearance of Superman in action comics number one.  Now, my company holds  records, world record.  We sold the first million-dollar comic book, 1.5,  2.2, and over 3 million.  This copy is conserved.  It has a little bit of  conservation done to it to maintain the structural integrity.  This comic  book, we estimated to sell for about $200 to $250,000, sold for $393,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  What -- now what does a collector do with that?   Just keep it covered and it's just - that's the price.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  I think it's in their safe or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $300,000 for a comic?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  $393,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Almost 400 grand for this cover.  Batman, a  significant character in D.C. Comics.  Why did that one bring in such a  large amount of money?  Tell us about the Batman.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  So, Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman.  This  comic book is actually restored.  If it wasn't restored, it would sell for  over a million dollars easy.  This comic we estimated to sell for about 200  to 250.  It sold for $313,000.  People love Batman, they love Superman.   These are two of the biggest characters in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  But what about characters today?  Are there new  characters that have emerged today that perhaps could command these kinds  of numbers? </p><p>ZURZOLO:  You know, there's a comic book that came out.  You might have  heard of it, The Walking Dead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Well, it's a huge T.V. show.  Walking dead is huge.  That's  comic book in perfect condition.  The number one copy can sell for over  $3,000, which is really exciting.  Our company will be bringing the world's  best collection of Walking Dead to auction later this year to coincide with  New York Comic-Con as well as an original art collection that's going to  blow the minds of many people around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how do you choose something like that, Walking Dead.  Why  did you think Walking Dead would be a good thing?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  I never did.  You know, it's not my market.  But I started  reading them and a comic book done in black and white that was done so  effectively.  It was just amazing.  When you read the original comic book,  you understand why it's become a worldwide phenomenon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating.  Vincent, great to have you.  Thanks so much for  walking us through it.  </p><p>ZURZOLO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Vincent Zurzolo there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  Congressman Steve Scalise's condition has improved.  He is upgraded from  critical to serious, just coming after he was shoot last week during  baseball practice with other Republican lawmakers.  The details next hour.   MORNINGS WITH MARIA back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th.  Here are  your top stories 7 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning.  London on edge again.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p> In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p> MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p> BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p> BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p> MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p> BAKER:  OK.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p> They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p> A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p> Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p> NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p> DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p> And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p> So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p> And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p> Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p> Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p> And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p> CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p> BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p> BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p> I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p> CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p> MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p> KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p> BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p> KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p> KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p> KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p> Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.

The  Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire  Whole Foods.  The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning!  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p> Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p> And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.

Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p> WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p> PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p> PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p> But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p> PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p> PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na[ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p> MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p> BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p> MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p> CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p> PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p> We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p> MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p> MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p> BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p> Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p> And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p> CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p> MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p> BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p> MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p> CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  As requested, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on  deck.  Charles Payne in for Stuart, Charles take it away.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday June 19.</p><p> Here are your top stories 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Breaking news this morning: London on edge again.  At least one person has  been killed, several others injured after a man plowed his van into a crowd  near a mosque in northern London.  British Prime Minister Theresa May  addressing the attack moments ago.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  This morning, our country woke to  news of another terrorist attack on the streets of our capital city; the  second this month and every bit as sickening as those which have come  before.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to London straight ahead to get the  latest there.</p><p> Meanwhile, YouTube taking steps to combat extremism.  Details on the  company's new policies coming up.</p><p> Technology executives are descending on the White House today.  Top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's IT system for a  meeting at the White House with the President.  Among the CEOs attending:  Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, IBM CEO Ginny Rometty among  others.</p><p> Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading today -- take a look.

Nasdaq up almost 40 points right now --  that's two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p> In Europe, gains across the board as well to report.  The FT 100 in London  up two-thirds of a percent.  The CAC 40 in Paris up almost 1 percent.  The  DAX index as well.</p><p> In Asia overnight markets close higher also.  The Hang Seng in Hong Kong  best performer -- up better than 1 percent.</p><p> And Brooks Koepka makes a name for himself at the U.S. Open. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Koepka -- our major champion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, he became the third straight American to win the U.S.  Open.  We've got all the highlights.</p><p> What's old is new again apparently.  Atari makes a comeback with a new  console.  This is the first new console in 20 years.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it: the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter is here; the CEO of  Rosecliff Mike Murphy is here; and the president of Diligence Mike Baker is  here.  Great to see you.</p><p> MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot on deck today.</p><p> BAKER:  Good morning.</p><p> LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Sure is.  Some great guests, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got important guests coming up to talk about what's  going on in London.  We're going to take you live to London momentarily.</p><p> The story out of the White House this morning in terms of technology and  Mike these markets are looking firmer.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Firm, new highs and I think there is a bit  underneath the market.  A lot of negatives out there but the market, as  they say, finds a wall of worry and that's what we're getting right now --  earnings supporting higher prices.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning: the counselor to  President Trump Kellyanne Conway is here -- don't miss that.  She's coming  up this hour.</p><p> First though new questions surrounding whether President Trump is actually  under investigation or not by the special counsel looking into Russia's  alleged election meddling.</p><p> On Friday the President tweeted this.  \"I'm being investigated for firing  the FBI director by the man who told me to fired the FBI director.  Witch  hunt.\"</p><p> But yesterday a member of the President's legal team contradicted that  tweet.  Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAY SEKULOW, MEMBER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM:  The President has not  been notified by anyone that he is under investigation.  That tweet, Chris  was in response to the \"Washington Post\" story that alleged that five  unnamed sources, anonymous sources linked to the \"Washington Post\" that the  President was in fact under investigation.  So that tweet was in response  to that.  </p><p> There has been no notification of any investigation.  Nothing has changed  since James Comey said the President was not a target or a subject of  investigation.  Nothing's changed.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst right now,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- good to see.  Good morning.</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on all of this.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, I think it's a little bit in the weeds because if you  have the former FBI director making a case for attempted obstruction of  justice or even bribery against the President of the United States and  making it in a fairly forceful way.  Whatever you think of him as an FBI  director, that is certainly enough to trigger an investigation.</p><p> So I think both sides are right.  I think that the President is being  investigated but he is not a target.  A target means they plan to bring  charges against you.  So when Jay Sekulow says he hasn't gotten a target  letter that it's probably technically true but it doesn't mean that he's  not been investigated.</p><p> State differently the FBI must investigate allegations of the nature and  quality that James Comey alleged in that senate testimony that he gave.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I don't know why the President feels the need to respond  to something like a \"Washington Post\" report.  He calls them fake news  anyway.  So why respond?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he has had tremendous success in energizing  his base -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  I know.  I get that.  I get that.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- with his tweets.  No human being in the modern era has had  the success that he has in communicating with his supporters and bypassing  the media.</p><p> But this is a dangerous area for him because we now see federal judges  taking literally Sean Spicer's statement.  The President's tweets official  government communications and federal judges using statements made in the  tweets to undermine oral arguments that his Justice Department is making in  court.</p><p> So he at times while undermining the base may be working at cross purposes  with what his Justice Department is trying to persuade federal judges.</p><p> BAKER:  This may not be a fair question, Judge but what is your gut  feeling?  Where is this going?  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  I don't know.  I wish I did.  I don't know where it's going  but I do believe that -- as I just said to all of you -- the allegations  that James Comey made were said with such credibility and confidence that  they can't be ignored and they will investigated.</p><p> Now, here is a good side of this.  Sometimes the FBI in the early stages  before you are a subject down here, before you're a target up here you are  sort of in the mix.  They may want to exclude certain people from becoming  subjects and targets and in order to do that they have to conduct an  investigation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, I think we should start looking at where the real  obstructionism has been in that where we know it was.  Senate Republicans  are now turning their attention and their investigative eyes to former  attorney general Loretta Lynch.  Some are saying that they want her to  testify after alarming accusations by the former director, Jim Comey, in  his recent congressional testimony.</p><p> Here is one thing he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  At one point the Attorney General had  directed me not to call it an \"investigation\" but instead to call it a  \"matter\" which confused me and concerned me.  But that was one of the  bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the  department if we are going to close this case credible.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So that was one of three things people are talking about in  terms of why Loretta Lynch needs to be investigated.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Number one, the matter versus investigation.  Number two, the  tarmac meeting -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- two days before Hillary Clinton was to testify, she met with  her husband President Clinton on the plane.</p><p> And number three, apparently there is a memo floating around that has not  been widely disseminated but basically says -- suggests that Loretta Lynch  I will be getting involved.  I'll make sure the FBI investigation of  Clinton doesn't go too far.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Now, we don't know if this memo exists.  But the reports on  the memo are the recipient of it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- the then chair of the Democratic National Committee.  Now  this was back before the DNC, when Bernie Sanders' candidacy was still  alive and Mrs. Clinton had not yet been exonerated by Jim Comey.  Just as I  said that Comey painted enough of a serious case against the President to  warrant investigation by the special prosecutor.</p><p> He clearly painted enough of a case against Loretta Lynch to be  investigated by not the senate judiciary committee but the same FBI, the  regular FBI, the Justice Department -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- and not the special prosecutor.</p><p> Now, it is odd and has only happened in rare instances that an attorney  general investigates his predecessor.  It happened, of course when John  Mitchell, Richard Nixon's Attorney General was prosecuted and convicted and  went to jail.  </p><p> But I am telling you there are enough allegations stated in a credible way,  supported by other forensic evidence like we saw pictures of her with Bill  Clinton -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- to warrant a criminal investigation of Mrs. Lynch for  misconduct in office.  Did she use the Justice Department as a political  instrument to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not to mention all of the spying that went on and the  unmasking.  Then there's that.  I am just throwing this out there because  there is a fair amount of things out there to investigate -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- at this point.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  but remember, this is not Bob Mueller.  This is Jeff Sessions  -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- and whoever is running.  It is still Andrew McCabe because  -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- Christopher Wray has not yet been confirmed.  It is the  regular DOJ that should be investigating her.</p><p> BAKER:  What I worry and this is what happens in Washington it seems like  all the time which is all these various issues now get molded together, the  public becomes utterly confused over where we're going with this.  And  eventually it all goes away and dies.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now it gives the impression of either scandal or  instability, neither of which is good to give that impression coming from  the Justice Department which is supposed to be relatively neutral -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- doing the right thing, enforcing the rule of law devoid of  politics and above the fray.  It doesn't seem to be that way right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is why I brought up the memo because there is also  speculation that is totally fake -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- I mean does it exist or not.  We don't know.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  We do know that the \"matter\" thing is true because -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The \"matter\" is true.  He testified under oath.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You'll get a peek at this because Mike -- you live in this  environment.  FBI agents were poking the director in the ribs saying,  you're now the director of the federal bureau of matters.  It's a criminal  investigation -- where is this \"matter\" nonsense coming from? </p><p> BAKER:  We've got to change the logo.  It's going to cost money.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right. Let's talk about a case that has really rocked  Hollywood and that is, of course, Bill Cosby; a shocking outcome to the  Bill Cosby sexual assault trial yesterday.  The judge declared a mistrial  after the jury was deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberation.</p><p> Judge -- what does this mean for the case against the comedian?  Walk us  through what a mistrial looks like.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  A judge must determine that no further deliberation time is  likely to change anybody's opinion.  Now we don't know if it's 11 to 1 or 6  to 6 or some combination.  Obviously you need unanimity for a conviction  and unanimity for acquittal.  And they didn't have unanimity.</p><p> Some judges will just ask the jury foreman, can you tell me Madam Foreman,  whether or not in your opinion any further deliberation will help.  Some  judges -- this is what I used to do were asked each individual juror.   Don't tell me how you're voting.  That's none of my business.  I want to  know if you still have an open mind or if you are steadfast and nothing  else will change that opinion.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll see.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  And once the judge comes to that conclusion well then it's  simply a waste of time.  The prosecutors have announced that they will  retry him probably in the fall or the winter.</p><p> This is a very, very strange case because he received a promise, Bill  Cosby, from a prosecutor don't worry you're not going to be prosecuted you  can give a deposition into what happened.  He gave the deposition, the  prosecutor died.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.</p><p> NAPOLITANO: The new prosecutor can -- the judge said, the promise is only  good for as long as he's the prosecutor.  So they can use your own words  against you.  That's called a built-in appeal.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is extraordinary.  That's incredible.  </p><p> Judge -- thank you.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great insights as always from you.  Judge Napolitano.</p><p> The U.K. authorities are now investigating that van attack near the London  mosque early this morning as a possible terrorist attack.  </p><p>Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is on the ground in  London right now with the very latest.  Benjamin -- good morning to you.</p><p> BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you  from London.  Well, yet another attack hitting London over here but, of  course, what it so s strikingly different in this case is that this was an  attack on Muslims.  Of course, we have seen vehicles being used time and  time again.  But not like this.</p><p> And as you said, this is now being treated as an act of terrorism and  investigated by the counter terrorism unit.  It happened just after  midnight here in Finchley, north London outside a Muslim center.  At a time  when the neighborhood was crowded with Muslims finishing Ramadan prayers.   It seems that the attacker knew when prayers ended and he was waiting.</p><p> Muslim leaders have now called it a hate crime and they've asked the public  to stay calm and try to avoid divisions within the community.</p><p> Police have arrested the driver.  He's a 48-year-old white man.    He was  grappled to the ground by two bystanders until the police could arrive.   Those two men are being called heroes.</p><p> Eyewitnesses have also reported that he said a number of times \"I've done  my bit\" and \"I want to kill Muslims.\"</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He did what he did deliberately to hit and kill as many  Muslims as possible.  So he is a terrorist.  So at this stage we are  calling for calm.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HALL:  And the video has also emerged showing the attacker apparently  blowing a kiss from the police van that he was been taken away.  He's been  taken to the hospital.  He's going to be charged when he is let out of  there.</p><p> But a lot of people are saying this is exactly what ISIS wanted.   (inaudible) the narrative.  It helps to create even greater divisions.  And  so right here where we are now in London very much on edge.  It's a very  multi-ethnic, very diverse neighborhood and the police really are just  trying to keep it safe, keep it under control.  The Prime Minister coming  out as well and saying this was not only an attack on this community.  It  was an attack on the whole of the country.  Back to you guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Benjamin -- thank you.  Benjamin Hall will get back  to you as news develops there.</p><p> Coming up -- Google cracks down on terrorism -- how technology giant says  it is combating the spread of extremism on YouTube.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The acting secretary of the Navy has promised a  full investigation into a collision between the destroyer a container ship  off of the coast of Japan.  It killed seven sailors.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the story now -- Cheryl</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria -- of course the story  developing over the weekend.  That collision happened early Saturday  morning as many of the crew slept.  Secretary Sean Stackley praised the  crewmembers for saving the USS Fitzgerald from further damage and bringing  it back into part.  And of course, the sad story is they find those  sailors.</p><p> Representative Steve Scalise's condition, we should say, has now been  upgraded to serious from critical.  According to Medstar Washington  Hospital Center, the congressman had more surgery over the weekend but he  does continue to show signs of improvement.  </p><p> And Scalise did not let his health crisis get in the way of father's day.   He said on the father's day message on twitter, saying quote, \"Steve's  greatest joy is being a father to Madison and Harrison and a husband to  Jennifer.  This father for the Scalise family and they send their best  wishes to every family especially the dads.  Take the time to be close to  the ones that you love.</p><p> Of course Scalise, one of five people wounded last week when a gunman  opened fire on Republicans at a baseball practice in suburban, Virginia.</p><p> Well, tomorrow's special election in Georgia.  It's too close to call.  And  the two candidates are scrambling for last-minute votes.  The race between  Republican Karen Handle and Democratic Jon Ossoff is seen as a key test for  Republican swing voters, uneasy with President Trump's policies.  </p><p> And Atari is back in the hardware business.  The company says it's making a  video game console for the first time in more than 20 years.  It's called  the Atari box, Some of the world's most iconic video games ran of course,  on Atari including Pong, Pac-Man.  Atari filed for bankruptcy in 2013.   They emerged here later as the company focused on mobile and online games  but the company says that Atari box is based on PC technology.  As a kid  always playing Atari -- bring it on back, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Bring back Pac-Man.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm ready for that.</p><p> BAKER:  I put a lot of quarters into the Pong machine -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How cool we are?</p><p> MURPHY:  It's fantastic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Pong, Pac-Man.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  I bought my three little boys Scooter, Slughorn (ph) and  Mugsie (ph).  I bought them an old Atari and they love this thing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BAKER:  And I was worried.  I thought they're going to look at it and go,  \"are you kidding me\".  They loved it.</p><p> MURPHY:  They take the Atari over the iPhone?</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  Come on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not your kids.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not your kids.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your kids are not taking Atari over the iPhone.</p><p> MURPHY:  They need the iPhone 7.  The 6 isn't even good enough.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.  All right.  We'll take a break.</p><p> When we come back, Google takes new measures to combat the rise of  terrorism online.

Tracee -- good morning to you.</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p> Now the parent company of Google says it is working to remove all videos  that violate YouTube's community guidelines such as those promoting  terrorism.  YouTube will increase technology and the number of experts to  flag terrorist-related content and videos that do not meet grounds for  removal but still promote offensive viewpoints will come with a warning and  will not be able to be recommended, endorsed or commented on by users  making them harder to find.  </p><p> YouTube will also use targeted online advertising to reach potential ISIS  recruits and then redirect them towards anti-terrorism videos that can  change their minds about joining.  A spokesperson for Google says quote,  \"There should be no place for terrorist content on our services.\"</p><p> The changes come after reports that one of the suspects in the London  Bridge terror attack became radicalized after watching pro-ISIS videos on  YouTube.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have faced harsh criticism for not  doing enough to remove extremist content from their Web sites.  </p><p> It is a daunting task with, you know, over 400 videos uploaded per minute.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For a long time these companies, YouTube included, were getting  criticized for not doing enough.  Do you see this as enough.</p><p> MURPHY:  Right.  I don't but I don't know what the answer is.  I think  somehow someway extremists are going to figure out a way to get their  message out there.</p><p> I don't know if these companies can actually do enough to stop it, if they  can do anything to stop it because I think the terrorists will get around  it someway.</p><p> BAKER:  This is an advantage.  This is actually a good move.  I agree, it's  not going to solve the problem entirely.  But it is in combination with a  variety of other things including locating, identifying and taking them  out.  This sort of step is also very helpful.</p><p> CARTER:  But I can't help but wonder, I mean with all the big data  advancements and they know who the target audiences are that are on their  sights, what they're interested in so they can serve up advertisement.  How  can they not know what else is going on?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's a good point you make because they've got  all these measurement tools -- </p><p> CARTER:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- to track everything else.  How come they can't track this  better?</p><p> CARTER:  When they could give me an advertisement on what I want why can't  they say, do you want something bad.</p><p> BAKER:  They could.  They could.  But you know what that means.  That means  changing laws.</p><p> MURPHY:  Censorship. </p><p> BAKER:  That's right.  And if they -- </p><p> MURPHY:  You're giving up something for getting something.  I'm not saying  we don't.  I think we should be more aggressive.  But that is a bigger  conversation.</p><p> CARTER:  But giving up a privacy to be told to.  I mean why not for  security.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's all important issues to bring up.</p><p> Tracee -- thank you.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p> Coming up -- Pushing ahead with President Trump's agenda.

Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us. </p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 19.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> London on edge once again -- a man ploughs his van into a crowd outside of  a mosque and is in police custody this morning.  Authorities are  investigating the incident as a terrorist attack.</p><p> Meanwhile news questions about the Russia probe -- whether President Trump  is actually under investigation at all despite his recent tweets.</p><p> Technology leaders are descending on the White House today.  The first  meeting of the Technology Advisory Council convenes late this afternoon  focusing on the government's IT system; among those attending Apple's CEO  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Amazon's Jeff Bezos among others.</p><p> While all of this is happening at the White House Congress is focused on  the agenda.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that he wants  healthcare done by the Fourth of July.  Senator Marco Rubio says speed  should not be the priority.  Here's what he told me yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I would rather us do it right than do it  fast because no matter what passes, if it isn't good or it has some  unintended consequence the President is going to be held responsible for  that.  Republicans are going to be held responsible for that.  Let's not  repeat the mistakes the Democrats made.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take a closer look at the legislative agenda coming up.</p><p> Markets are rallying today, kicking off the week strongly -- Dow  Industrials at the highs of the morning right now up to 75 points.  Nasdaq  up almost 40.</p><p> In Europe the indices are also higher across the board; up between half a  percent and 1 percent the CAC 40 up almost 1 percent this morning in Paris. </p><p> In Asia overnight, stocks finished higher there as well.  Take a look --  Japan did well, up two-thirds of a percent.  Hong Kong up better than 1  percent.</p><p> Brooks Koepka wins the U.S. Open, his first ever major championship  victory.  We've got the highlights of the U.S. Open this morning.</p><p> And Olympic Great, Michael Phelps taking on new competition, get this,  details on his race against the great white shark.  How's that going to  work?  We will tell you about it. </p><p> First, our top story this half hour right now, tragedy strikes London  again, British authorities now saying a suspect has been detained after a  van plowed into a crowd of worshipers near a Mosque in Northern London  early this morning.  According to London police they are treating this as a  possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at the scene though it's  unclear if his death was actually related to the attack.  Ten others were  wounded, the driver, a 48-year-old man arrested at the scene after being  detained by members of the public.  According to some reports witnesses  said that the driver was heard shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.</p><p> Joining me right now is Counsel to the president, Kellyanne Conway.   Kellyanne, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, U.S. PRESIDENT:  It's a pleasure Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  We've got extra security  measures being taken, people are worried.  Do you expect we'll see extra  security measures taken in the U.S. as a result of what went on in London?</p><p> CONWAY:  Well the president and his counterterrorism team assess this  situation throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were  concerned with their British counterparts and since it looks like the  British government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll  wait to see how that investigation unfolds.</p><p> And where we support our allies anyway that they need, we just don't want  this to become the new normal where people feel like they're changing the  behavior, their lifestyles, their lives indeed Maria and allowing the  terrorists in any form to win and to prevail.  And so we know that people  are very concerned about national security, it's in large part how the  president won.  He just frankly put out the more masculine, more robust  antiterrorism program whether it's (inaudible) strength or him wanting ISIS  to be in retreat.  Hillary Clinton referred to them as our, \"determined  enemies\" at her convention speech so I think there's a huge contrast.  And  you're seeing that play out now where the president is constantly talking  about how his first response really to this nation is our safety and  security.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, he really did.  And I think that's why it's just a head  scratch as far as why he gets this pushback on the travel ban and  everything else.</p><p> Meanwhile, there are new questions surrounding whether or not the president  is actually under investigation or not by the Special Counsel looking into  Russia's alleged election meddling.  On Friday the president tweeted out  this, \"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who  told me to fire the FBI Director!  Witch Hunt.\"  And then yesterday, a  member of the president's legal team contradicted the tweet.  Kellyanne, is  the president under investigation?</p><p> CONWAY:  Well I don't think Jay Sekulow, the president (inaudible)  contradicting the tweet, I think he explained it.  What Mr. Sekulow said is  that is that the president is constrained by the 140 characters in Twitter.</p><p> The president uses his social media platform to communicate directly with  the people as you know Maria.  But that Jay Sekulow, his per -- one of his  personal lawyers said the president has not been notified that he's under  investigation.  In fact, Mr. Comey testified that the president is not the  president said in the letter where he dismissed Mr. Comey in May, that  Comey had told him three times that he wasn't under investigation, they've  not been notified otherwise.  His personal lawyer would know this.</p><p> And it's important to say that because what the president was reacting to  in that particular social media message was the Washington Post report that  was based on five anonymous seekers, anonymous sources that must have been  leaked that he's somehow under investigation.  His lawyer is saying no he's  not.  So I think he's explaining that the president is really pointing out  the irony of everything and the last part of his tweet is the most  important which is that he consider this to be a witch hunt.</p><p> We've been doing this for many, many months now having an investigation,  where's the collusion?  Where's the obstruction of justice?  Where's the  evidence that supports this conclusion and we have separate, what, five or  six different separate congressional investigations going on and we've been  doing this for eight to nine months, I mean you could have a baby in this  time and they have no evidence.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well look, I have been very adamant about this as well from the  beginning saying, look, this is a -- it looks like a completely  manufactured story.  Russia has been hacking, it has been undermining the  U.S. and the West for decades, why attach the president to that he has  nothing to do with it?</p><p> However, why respond to the Washington Post do you think Kellyanne?  I mean  the president has rightly so called some of the news out there fake news  and in many cases the president was right, why respond to the Washington  Post?  I mean the idea of tweeting, I understand he's speaking directly to  the American people, people like it and it's been a good strategy for him.   But can you convince him or ask him why he's not tweeting about the agenda?   Why he's not tweeting about other -- why bring up the Russia story and  respond to the Washington Post when this is a news organization he's called  fake news anyway.</p><p> CONWAY:  So here's where everybody has to wake up each morning and make  their own choices.  The media could cover all of his tweets and if they did  that, they would see that he more often tweets about agenda items than  other matters.  </p><p> He has this constant stream on Instagram, on Facebook, on Twitter, his big  social media platform where he says reaches about 100 million people,  Maria.  And you had the entire day in Cuba the other day where he rolled  back these awful rules that Obama put in place that allowed the Cuban  Regime not the Cuban people to benefit financially.  We had the first  meeting at the White House with the Opioid Commission on Friday.  Earlier  in the week the president did workforce development and apprenticeship  week, that's all on Twitter.</p><p> This week he'll be meeting with the -- today he'll be meeting with the tech  CEOs.  Last week he also sign some things into laws and the EOs that  benefit people, benefit workers.  All of that goes on to his Twitter feed  when he has a bilateral.  He's hosted I think more than 20 now with the  White House with foreign leaders but people don't want to cover that, they  want to cover -- they're very selective in the different tweets they want  to cover.  So he -- I'm telling you, the American people see all of the  social media platforms.  They're sort of saying attention saying, \"Wow,  he's going to put all this money and all this force in effect of the White  House behind apprenticeship programs where those who go through at  apprenticeship program the Department of Labor say they get -- they're 90  percent get employed immediately and they make an average of $60,000 per  year.</p><p> So we want to dignify all types of career paths, all types of jobs, the  welders, the hairdressers, the plumbers, the carpenters, people who get a  high school diploma and a skill certificate.  All of that's on the social  media platform, they just don't want to cover it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  I think that's a fair point.  I mean, but there is  criticism that the president brings up things that he doesn't really need  to.  I mean does he create some obstacles for himself by bringing up some  of the things that perhaps the supporters don't believe anyway?</p><p> CONWAY:  Well in this case though he -- first of all, he's the president of  all Americans and he made that clear beginning on November 9th and he's  never wavered from that.  </p><p> People who criticize him and even deny that the legitimacy of his  presidency will benefit from his tax cut, they will benefit from better  healthcare, they will be benefit from infrastructure, they will benefit  from ISIS in retreat, they will benefit from the regulatory framework being  chipped away because it's impeding our pocketbook in a personal liberty  issues.  But Maria, the fact that the president feels he has a right to  defend himself on occasion.</p><p> He's watching a one-sided witch hunt as he refers to it because it's not  like if we're in a court of law and you're watching people -- you're  watching one side and it's a prosecution rest and here comes the defense,  it doesn't work that way.  You got Comey testifying without anybody  responding in front of 20 million people.  You've got outlet after outlet  that's still criticizing him that is against him, that's part of the  \"resistance and obstruction.\"  You got an entire democratic party and their  presidential nominee (inaudible)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about what the president could do but let  me get to this because the president has added John Dowd, a veteran lawyer  in Washington to his legal team.  Is the president preparing for a legal  battle?  Is that why he is upping the number of people on the legal team?   Tell us what he's expecting.</p><p> CONWAY:  Well he's always been a prepared man.  He's a very smart  businessman, among the smartest, most successful.  </p><p> And he's just somebody who surrounds himself with the best and the  brightest and he's doing that here as well.  What he's preparing for is  what we already know exist which is this investigation that's ongoing --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The witch hunt is what he calls it.</p><p> CONWAY:  Witch hunt.  But it continues forward for now and he's just  preparing himself for that.  And I know a number of these attorneys and  they're all very talented and they all have different types of expertise.</p><p> And I think the most important thing is that they understand their client  in this case and that they protect him and they avail him of every possible  resource in him defending himself, he has the right to do that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, I think the left has been really driving this  narrative in terms of the Russia probe from the get-go since the president  took office.  What can the president do to keep the team on focus on the  agenda?  </p><p> I mean, yesterday I had on a number of congressman and they blame the  senate for part of the obstructionist.  I mean we've got a healthcare bill  sitting in the senate, a lot of people want to see tax reform this year.   The president has been vocal about it, he wants a 15 percent corporate tax  rate, he's talked about his white paper that he's come out within that  regard but is there anything that the president can do to ensure that they  get something done, the congress passes legislation this year?  Because  Kellyanne, the truth is is, you could take one issue like the travel ban,  they're pushing back there.  You could take another issue like repealing  and replace ObamaCare, pushing back there.  But the real goal of the left  is to take over the house in 2018 and move to impeach President Trump.  How  does he get ahead of that?</p><p> CONWAY:  Well first of all, he has asked for their votes, we would still  love to have democratic votes on healthcare, on tax reform the way  President George W. Bush had 10 or 12 democratic senators in 2001 Maria to  pass his tax cut.</p><p> The democrats -- the senate was controlled by the democrats when President  George W. Bush passed his tax cut.  So we would love to have democratic  vote on infrastructure and any number of these measures.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It doesn't look like (inaudible) </p><p> CONWAY:  And it doesn't look like they're even interested in governing.   The democrats are interested in politics, the president is interested in  governing and leading and having impact from people's lives.</p><p> So we're always open in getting their votes, where are they?  Why don't  they come to the table and channel some bipartisanship on measures that  affect their constituents as well?  Number two, the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the healthcare  reform.  You know, ObamaCare has been a (inaudible) for over seven years,  the sinking battleships turns slowly and they've got part one through the  House, now the senate will do its work, Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th that's around the corner.  Tax reform later  this year, they're moving towards infrastructure, towards border security,  more of that, the military's got new funding.</p><p> So things are happening and everywhere I go that's what people reflect back  to me, \"Tell the president we see what he's doing, to keep doing it, to not  give up, to knock it in.  We're praying for him, we support him, he's  making the impact on people's lives.\"  So I think the president just has to  have this two front in the one hand keeping an eye on these investigations  that he calls a witch hunt that so far have produced nothing but a waste of  taxpayer dollars --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's expensive.</p><p> CONWAY:  And it's getting really expensive.  We live through this before,  where are the same democrats who complained about previous investigations  that actually did bear fruit where a former president lied under oath and  obstructed justice.  We know what happened there.</p><p> They were -- they complained completely about the waste of taxpayer  dollars, I would up that end up to here.  And then, of course, the  president's main front is passing all this stuff, I work with him every  single day he and his senior team and his cabinet, his vice president  Maria, are forging ahead to create those jobs, to continue to have  confidence in the economy.  You see the small business manufacturing home  builder, consumer confidence numbers, you see the way the markets has  responded to this man's presidency.  He's been there five months tomorrow,  it's only five months.  People feel like things should be going faster and  faster because they know that's Donald Trump's pace.</p><p> But he's up against a Washington that moves much more slowly than he does  but I think the two shall meet.  And there's two paces and there's two ways  of doing business will actually produce -- continue to produce results for  real people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well there's no doubt about it the president has been  incredibly successful in terms of rolling back regulations.  Whatever he  can do in terms of executive orders, without the congress, he's been able  to do and it's been very successful.</p><p> But he does face this goal on the left of just obstructing, stop the  agenda.  Chuck Schumer has been very clear.  They don't -- you're not going  to get democratic support.  I mean do you really think you're going to get  democratic support on tax reform or repeal and replace?  No.</p><p> CONWAY:  I feel like if people watch your show should call the democratic  senators and members of congress and say, \"Get on with it now.  Accept the  election results, stop with the resistance and move on to governing, move  on to leading.\"  </p><p> Because the democratic party is in an odd place right now, they had their  true leader, they're all arguing, they don't know what they're governing  philosophy is accepted, the message now is the message wasn't (inaudible)  Maria which is, \"You're terrible and I'm not you.\"  That's not a message,  that's an insult to anyone (inaudible).  But the democrats are stuck  somewhere between not being able to accept the 2016 election results and  being completely focused in the 2018 election results.</p><p> What about 2017?  What about governing?  What about leading?  What about --  you owe it to your constituents to get things done --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see -- yes.  We'll see if the public responds to the  obstructionism come '18.</p><p> CONWAY:  They were (inaudible) did you see the approval ratings?  Chuck  Schumer, the democrat, Pelosi their approval ratings are all much lower  than the president.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.  All right.  Today, you've got a very  big meeting at the White House with technology CEOs.</p><p> CONWAY:  Yes, very exciting.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The IT of government system is at focus, is that where the  priority is?  What's going to go on at the --  </p><p> CONWAY:  It is indeed.  And President Trump and Jared Kushner, his senior  adviser who runs the Office of American Innovation has been way on top of  this issue from day one.  </p><p> What is it?  We literally have government agencies and cabinets they can't  speak to each other because they have different programs.  And look at what  just happened recently in the last couple of weeks with the Veterans  Affairs Administration, you've got the Department of Defense and Veterans  Affairs literally weren't talking to each other.  So what Jared did is he  invited in the five brightest tech people or five tech experts in DoD, five  from Veterans Affairs and said, \"How can we get this together?\" </p><p> Viola, now we have a system in place where veterans will be treated as one  single patient seamlessly through both of those agencies.  So the idea is  to stop all this waste -- do you realize that LMB just finished with Y2K?   In 2017, do you realize that there are 1,000 different hotlines for  veterans to call the Veterans Affairs?  Do you realize that we spend -- the  average American spends like 30 hours a year on paperwork for the  government?  So we need a government agency that talks to each other and  make it seamless and modernize it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what the goal is today.</p><p> CONWAY:  And we're glad the tech CEOs are coming in to do that.  We know  that they have been incredibly successful, they do this for a living and  we're happy that they're coming to share their best practices with the  president.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Kellyanne, good to see you.</p><p> CONWAY:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kellyanne Conway there.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The death toll from last week's high-rise fire  in London is continuing to rise.  Cheryl Casone with the details now,  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes Maria, we're getting the numbers  unfortunately London police now says 79 people are now dead or missing  following that terrible fire at Grenfell Tower.  That's up from the last  update that we'd received a 58 dead or missing.</p><p> London Mayor Sadiq Khan says the fire was a preventable accident caused by  years of neglect from the government, their siding materials in that  building.  Local officials have come under heavy criticism for not  providing enough support or information.  So the cause of the fire was  (inaudible) 24 storey building does remain under investigation today but  there had been suggestions the new paneling used in a recent renovation may  have helped the flames move quickly at the outside of the building.  Again,  we're following the story for you out of London this morning.</p><p> We're also got (inaudible) at home Lockheed Martin in the final stages  negotiating a huge deal worth more than $37 billion.  The defense  contractor reportedly going to sell a record 440 F35 fighter jets serve  from 11 nations that does include the U.S.  The final price those jets  expected to be around $85 million.</p><p> And finally this is a way to make sure your child flies for free, give  birth onboard the aircraft.  A baby boy was born yesterday on an India Jet  Airways flight between Saudi Arabia to India.  The flight diverted to  Mumbai after a mom went into labor.  Luckily, a trained nurse was onboard,  and crew, and, of course, the passengers as well helped deliver that baby.   The airline has given the little boy Maria a free lifetime pass as a  birthday gift.  He flies for free for life.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Thank you so much Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Brooks Koepka, how about that, swinging into the  history books this weekend with his first major championship.  The winner  of the U.S. Open, we've got all the highlights for a wild end for that  Open, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We have another first time winner of the major  championship in golf to report.  The U.S. Open wrapped up yesterday in  Wisconsin, we were happy to be there last week.  Jared Max with all the  highlights, Jared.</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.  Seven straight major  won by a golfer who never won a major before.</p><p> 27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka did in a record setting fashion.  All  tied up on the scoreboard with just six holes to go, Brian Harman now enter  Sunday lead to get minus 12 but fell apart with a couple of lay bogies on  12 and 13 as he was fall -- he would fall a couple of shots behind.  While  Brooks Koepka would to everything he needed to do.  Late in the tournament,  Koepka had birdies on 14, 15, and 16, eventually we would go to the 18th  hole and Brooks Koepka would manage to get in there for a birdie.  He  finishes at 16-under par, that ties Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest  score in relation to par at a U.S. Open.  Good for a check yesterday of  $2.16 million, that's the largest earning in one day in golf history,  congratulations to the 27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka.  </p><p> Last August, Kyle Larson earned his first career NASCAR victory at Michigan  International Speedway by beating out his friend Chase Elliot.  Yesterday,  Kyle Larson did it again.  In the target car, 15 laps to go at the  (inaudible) 400.  Larson would take advantage of a restart and claim the  lead from Kyle Bush and then with about 10 laps to go, you see Ryan  Blaney's care malfunctions, causes a pileup, Daniel Suarez gets clipped, he  runs in down (inaudible) into the wall.  Final laps though, Kyle Larson  scores his third career win and second of the season and celebrates with  his son on Father's Day.</p><p> All right.  So the Warriors lost the NBA title last year and then they  signed Kevin Durant and then they beat the Cavaliers for the championship  this year.  So now it's the Cavaliers turn to make a splash, right?  Well  according to Yahoo's Vertical, the Cavaliers received a phone call this  weekend from the Indiana Pacers who wanted to know if they might be  interested in making a trade for All Star Paul George who reportedly told  the team he will opt out of his contract in 2018 to become an unrestricted  free agent.  Paul George average nearly 24 points gain for the Pacers and  he is also friends with Lebron James back in April.  Lebron posted this on  Instagram saying, \"Nothing but love and respect.  Love the battle last  night bro.  I'm glad to see you back where you belong\" and includes this  hashtag #youngking because Lebron is king.  So maybe this is the beginning  of a recruiting process, Paul George, what a talented player, he's beaten a  bad injury, his back, so Cleveland would have to give up an arm and a leg  together.</p><p> MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was going to say, who are they  going to give up?</p><p> MAX:  Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love maybe.</p><p> BAKER:  You can't give up Kyrie.  No, no.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Paul George is no Kevin  Durant.  </p><p> MAX:  Correct.  Very few people are.  </p><p>      BAKER:  Do you think Erin Hills is going to take -- that was the first  time they hosted the Open, are they going to take any heat for the  (inaudible)?</p><p>      MAX:  Yes because the scores were way too strong.  We had more I  believe -- there were more scores under par yesterday than -- in this  tournament than we ever have in history as far as U.S. Open, so it wasn't  strong enough.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting if that's the case.  It was a long course,  they walked nine miles versus an average six miles on other course.</p><p> Let me ask you this, you got to explain this story to me, the Olympic  swimmer Michael Phelps has a new rival.  Phelps is going to face off  against El Great White Shark for a reality series on the Discovery Channel.   It's unclear how they're going to be raising against one another but it  will air during the Discovery Channel Shark Week, what do you make of this?</p><p> MAX:  Michael Phelps swims at best six miles per hour, a great white goes  twenty miles per hour.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, what's the point?</p><p> MAX:  So I don't know how -- maybe -- somebody said maybe if Phelps gets a  head start, he starts first and then the shark coming after him maybe he  can get the seven miles an hour.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  (inaudible) the sharks chasing him, let's see how fast he  goes then.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There will be some protective situation where he's in like a  tunnel of some sort.  I don't know, how are they going to do it.</p><p> MAX:  Maybe.  He's going to need a bigger boat.</p><p> LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Swim in a cage.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to watch Discovery Channel for that one.   Jared, thank you.</p><p> MAX:  Thanks Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jared Max.

Rosecliff  Chief Executive Officer, Mike Murphy is here.  And Diligence President,  Mike Baker.  Good to see you everybody.</p><p> MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Good morning.</p><p> LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Really important conversation today, we're going to talk  about London, a fourth terrorist attack.  And in that meeting at the White  House Mike, I know you want to talk a lot about technology as well.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lot to get to this morning.  And coming up joining the  conversation this morning, the Adviser to President Trump, KellyAnne Conway  is joining us this morning.  So we're going to get into all of the above  with KellyAnne Conway when she joins us, coming up.</p><p> But first, terror strike in London again this morning.  British authority  say that the suspect has been detained as a van plowed into a crowd of  worshipers near a mosque in North London early this morning.  According to  London police, they are treating it as a possible act of terrorism.  One  man found dead at the scene though it is unclear if his death was related  to the attack.  At least 10 others were wounded.  The driver, a 48-year-old  man arrested at the scene after being detained by members of the public.   Video of the moment showed a Caucasian man being detained by police.   According to some reports, witnesses said that the driver was heard  shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.  Mike Baker, what do you make of this  attack?</p><p> BAKER:  Well I think the London authorities are right when they say, \"Look,  you got to condemn extremism no matter what it is.  This is not rocket  science.</p><p> A van drove in to a crowd of Muslims coming out of Mosque, it's Ramadan so  they're coming out, it's about a quarter twenty after midnight and so we  don't have to sit in angst and think too much about what this was all  about.  This is anger welling up from the recent attacks most likely that  had taken place in London whether the concert bombing or London in  Westminster Bridge attacks.  So --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I guess you look at the facts that it's four attacks in just  three months and try to put together the similarities as if it's ISIS  related but this doesn't seem to be that.</p><p> BAKER:  No, this is not.  Again, I don't -- I'm not one to sit and over  think something like this.  We just have to look at it, be pragmatic,  understand what it is and this is a response to what's been happening and  it's wrong and you can't -- what -- people always talk about sort of this  equivalency.  </p><p> \"Oh, if you talk like that or if you do drone campaigns then you lower  yourself to the level of the terrorist.\"  With the drones, I don't think  that's the case, I've never had a problem in operations in counterterrorism  differentiating myself from the bad guys.  But when something like this  happens, it does.  It's on the same level, you're attacking people coming  out their place of worship, you can't do it.</p><p> MURPHY:  I mean it's got to be a really scary time to live in London  because you have so many recent attacks and then there -- I'm sure there  are more people like this looking to respond to those attacks.</p><p> So you look back at all the people that they brought in to London and how  they let them branch off into little areas, pockets of their own  communities and it's got to be a really scary place to live right now.</p><p> BAKER:  Well it's a real divisiveness and you're absolutely right.  To  point out with this whole concept of multiculturalism that has developed  over decades now.</p><p> In the U.K. and now across the E.U. where the idea was, you don't  necessarily -- it was no effort to integrate within the society.  Celebrate  where you came from, celebrate your own culture.  Well that has created  this problem, this is a self inflicted wound to some degree and how they  resolve it, well in the immediate aftermath, they have to do what they're  doing which is Theresa May and all the other leaders have to come out,  condemn it, denounce, show transparency and a quick response just like they  would with any other attack.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But also push this idea that we will clamp down on any  extremism which they haven't done.  As you say, they're allowing people to  live in this no-go areas practice Sharia Law.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  The no-go thing is -- it's complicated, it's not quite the  narrative that has built up over a period of time now where somehow these  are (inaudible) police can't go in there, they go in there, they can go in  there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Even in Paris?</p><p> BAKER:  Yes, even in Paris.  The problem is, it's not so much you have  access to go in there, the problem is developing communication.  And I know  this is going to sound touchy-feely at some 30,000 foot level but I'm  talking from an operational perspective.</p><p> You have to get into this communities, develop some level of trust in  communication in order so that when they see somebody, an immediate family  member, this is the only way you stop some of these folks is that the mom  or the cousin or the brother picks up the phone and has the ability to call  the local authorities.  So the no-go area is more of a tactical operation  which is no communication within these communities.</p><p> CARTER:  Yes.  I do think this is a global issue though.  I mean we're  looking at London and what's happening right now in London.  Paris for a  while was the focus.</p><p> Here we've had -- even here in United States we've had so many issues.   This is global percolating -- percolation as a result I believe of ISIS --  as the result of this attack.  And so I think --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think is okay to do.</p><p> CARTER:  Well exactly.  When I think what -- this would have been an  opportunity for Theresa May I think to really regain confidence and she  hasn't really stepped up into that level.</p><p> And so I think it's really important right now that our world leaders step  up to the table and everybody says, \"Look, we're on the same page here,  let's stop with the blame game, let's just keep moving things forward and  let's start fresh.  There's so many opportunities right now on so many  things that we agree on, enough is enough let's move forward.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  Meanwhile, in Washington today, President  Trump meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White  House.  </p><p> This is the inaugural meeting of what they're calling \"The American  Technology Council.\"  Take a look at some of the leaders that are going to  be present there, the CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos will be there, as well as  Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, Tim Cook from Apple, IBM's Ginni Rommetty  just to name a few.  Mike Murphy, what do you make of this?  This is the  Trump Administration trying to update its IT they say.</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't know how you can find a negative in this.  So Trump feels  like we need to serve the American people better with better technology so  he goes out and he gets the top people from the field of technology in the  world to advise him on it.  So I think -- and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What's wrong with that?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think it's the exact, right way to handle it and I think anybody  who doesn't show up or chooses not to show up is just showing a lack of  openness because you can debate.  </p><p> We can have different views on things but if I'm an expert in a certain  field and you're leading the country, you want to hear from me, you need to  hear from me.  So I think anybody who shows up there, it doesn't mean they  necessarily support President Trump, it means they support the United  States of America and I think it's a great thing that he's doing, I think  it's a great thing all of these people are doing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And to modernize the IT system of the U.S. is exactly what we  need by the way.  We're just looking at pictures of the president and the  first lady coming off of the plane from Camp David, the spent the weekend  in Camp David, Lee Carter.  He tweeted out that it was an honor to be there  as well.</p><p> CARTER:  I think that the American people are really glad to see him doing  these kinds of things.  I think they were -- there's a lot of criticism  spending time at his own property and I think people want to see President  Trump acting presidential doing a lot of the activities that they're used  to and I think there's something comforting about seeing him here.</p><p> I think it's also nice to see Barron in the picture too and enjoying  himself taking selfies being -- it's very, very human.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's being a kid.</p><p> CARTER:  Being a kid, yes.  </p><p> BAKER:  I wouldn't want to be a kid coming off of the Marine1.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I would have taken a selfie.  All right.  Let's talk  about the agenda for a second because senate republicans are working hard  to finalize their bill to replace ObamaCare.</p><p> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he hopes to bring the bill  to the floor within the next two weeks.  Yesterday, I spoke with Senator  Marco Rubio he said the process will likely take a little longer.  Here's  what he told me on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) FLORIDA:  I think healthcare will happen this year,  tax reform we'll see.  We're working on that now, there's a component of it  that I'm working with Ivanka Trump on where there's the pro family  component of it and in fact we'll have a meeting this week with her and a  number of senators and house members to begin to layout that portion of the  agenda.</p><p> But I do think tax reform, these things can work simultaneously.  You don't  have to wait to finish on healthcare before you start formulating ideas on  tax reform and that's happening right now.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well I would expect the questions to really ramp up certainly  this week after what happened last week.  Steve Scalise is still on the  hospital obviously.  His condition was downgraded from a critical to  serious condition.  But do you worry about where the agenda stands now in  terms of tax reform and healthcare reform?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think it seems like as if people after what happened last week,  people want to work together.  So hopefully, this was a bottom as far as  the divisiveness in Washington and now people can come together, put both  sides on the table and reach an agreement.</p><p> BAKER:  What I don't understand and maybe I'm just speaking this average  simpleton, when Marco Rubio says, \"You don't have to wait to start ideas on  tax reform\" why weren't the republicans doing this two years ago?  Why  didn't -- when they had this opportunity and they stepped in, they didn't  open the drawer, pull out their plan and say, \"Here it is, here's our tax  reform\" because that would have been the time to do this and not now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They repeal and replace.</p><p> BAKER:  Right.  I don't understand how Washington works, maybe that's as  simple as that.  I -- it's dysfunctional.</p><p> CARTER:  I think America does that's why Donald Trump is president.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I will say this, there is a feeling the leadership says  continually that they are having meetings on tax reform right now just what  Marco Rubio just said that they are doing this behind the scenes in hopes  of getting this done this year.  Are you still a believer that they're  going to get something done?</p><p> CARTER:  I'm always an optimist and I hope they're going to get something  done.  I would love to see them say, \"We're going to work through the  summer break right now to get it done for the American people\" because  that's what they should do.  They made a promise, they should keep it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Or they will do healthcare before July 4th which seems  incredible or maybe they get something out and then they do tax reform  after the summer, I don't know.  Two weeks.</p><p> CARTER:  It's just two weeks, yes.</p><p> BAKER:  They need the big legislative win.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They do.</p><p> BAKER:  They have to have that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They really do.  We'll take a short break we've got a lot of  conversations on deck this morning.</p><p> Coming up in Colorado, some kids may go back to using a landline.  Why one  group is looking to ban the sale of cell phones for children under 13.</p><p> Then Brooks Koepka wins the U.S. Open, gaining his first ever major  championship victory.  We've got all the highlights from the big open, back  in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A navy jet has shot down a Syrian warplane.   Cheryl Casone with the details now, good morning.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Maria.  Well a U.S.  navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian government warplane after it attacks  Washington best fighters near Raqqa.</p><p> This is according to statement from U.S.-led coalition, the coalition said  in that statement that the shoot down was in accordance with rules of  engagement and a number of (inaudible) fighters were wounded in the attack.   Fox News is reporting the Super Hornet that shot down the jet was based  onboard the USS George H.W. Bush which is currently operating in the  Mediterranean Sea.  </p><p> Meanwhile here at home, Colorado is considering banning preteens from  owning cell phones.  Residents in favor, the campaign say that kids under  13 years of age spend too much time on their phone.  Under proposed law,  cell phone retailers will be required to ask the age of the primary cell  phone user before it's sold, parents would not be allowed to buy phones for  their kids that are under the age of 13.  Retailers would face a $500 fine  if they don't comply with this one.</p><p> And Cars 3 sped, get it, into the number one spot at the box office over  the weekend.  This is the 16th Pixar film to debut at number one.  They  brought in $53.5 million that beat the recording breaking Wonder Woman we  should say over the weekend but she is still a force to reckon with Maria,  that moving topping $570 million worldwide.</p><p> And a big in tournament, Brooks Koepka, the golfer coming out on top at the  U.S. Open this weekend.  He won his first major championship, he finished  16 under matching Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest rating score to par  at a U.S. open.  Koepka now the third American to win the U.S. Open in a  row following Dustin Johnson last year and during the (inaudible) in 2015.   Maria, I watch the show that looks like you had a great time at the U.S.  Open.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is beautiful.  We really did enjoyed.  It was great Cheryl.   Thank you so much.  </p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the -- as U.S. authorities consider expanding a ban  for carryon laptops, airlines are faking the consequences.  How a broader  ban could affect you with the airport, coming up.</p><p> Then one American businessman, $5 billion away from overtaking Bill Gates  as the world's richest person, we'll tell you who it is next, back in a  minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos coming closer to  becoming the world's richest man after the company announced the Whole  Foodss deal on Friday, Amazon shares soared adding nearly $2 billion to  Bezos' net worth.</p><p> According to the Wall Street Journal, one firm says that the bidding for  Whole Foodss may only be getting underway -- just beginning to get  underway.  Joining us right now is Kingsview Asset Management Chief  Investment Officer, Scott Martin.  Scott, good to see you.</p><p> SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Hey  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What an incredible deal.  When we first heard that deal on  Friday, what do you say?  My instinct was, they're taking over the world,  Amazon, I mean it's pretty incredible.  What were your thoughts?</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes.  I was shocked.  I mean Amazon now wants to control your  grocery aisle.  And you know what's interesting Maria too, I think there's  a couple of things going on with this deal, first of all, it's been rumored  and it came together at a very last minute.  </p><p> In fact, Amazon was only supposedly working on this deal for a matter of  weeks which maybe speaks to your point about this just begins the whole  negotiation process with respect to this deal but as far as the grocery  aisle goes, this isn't a great business.  If you look at the grocery in the  last several years, consumers are becoming more discerning, profit margins  are lowering at the grocers.  So what exactly Amazon's going to do to the  grocery aisle and do how you shop for your groceries is going to be  interesting with respect to the big reach they have now with Amazon Prime  and some of the other things they're doing at the company.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean look, people saw the deal, Mike Murphy, and they  thought, \"Wow, this is an incredible combination, they bid up the stocks  but the grocery business not such an easy business, that's number one.  And  number two is this may not be so easy to take it over, the journalist  reporting the Neuberger Berman might be a bidder, that there's a new  process that other bids will come in.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I can see anyone coming into bid against Bezos and Amazon.   They have --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And paying more than $13 billion.</p><p> MURPHY:  Because if you do bid it up, I think Bezos, he obviously wants the  company, he can go in and bid above them, it's going to be hard to compete.   I mean maybe a Walmart could go in and try to compete but I don't really  see that.</p><p> I think Whole Foodss is going to be acquired by Amazon and it's a low  margin business, it's not a great business to be in but I think Bezos is  thinking two or three steps ahead.  I think he's thinking about using all  the Whole Foods stores over 400 stores nationwide as fulfillment centers,  as processing centers, as warehouses.  I think he's seeing all the Whole  Foods customers, the affluent customers as Amazon members.  Remember,  Amazon stock popped on Friday on this news, it went up and increased more  market value than the entire purchase price that they're paying for Whole  Foods.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p> MURPHY:  So I think right now the market's betting on Bezos and thinking  Bezos is going to figure this out.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How about all the other supermarket companies that all sold  off?  I mean everybody was worried it.  You look at Kroger, you look at the  other supermart companies and -- I mean what was that all about?  Do you  think people were just nervous?</p><p> MURPHY:  It was Kroger, it was Walmart, it was all of the supermarket  companies just thinking that Amazon is getting in here now, they're going  to do what they did in e-commerce.  They're going to just crush margins,  they can afford to lose money for a number of years.  So therefore they  could really put a ton of pressure on all the other grocers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> MURPHY:  But I there's potential there because I think there'll be more  consolidation amongst the other place.</p><p> BAKER:  Well Whole Foods been having problems for some time now, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They needed help.</p><p> BAKER:  And I wonder to what degree this might be in part a strategic shot  at Walmart, you mentioned Walmart.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, big -- I mean it's a big part of it.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  Yes.  And remember, an activist hedge funds came in and took  a big stake, almost a 10 percent stake in Whole Foods Jana Partners and  they were putting a lot of pressure on the board to do something, that  definitely had something to do with this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey Scott, jump in here.  What about -- then there's the Yahoo  story as well, end of an era, officially becoming Altaba as it starts  trading under a new name, Yahoo becomes Altaba.  Do you think the company  will be able to turn around now that the Verizon deal is done?</p><p> MARTIN:  You know it's interesting Maria, when you look at Yahoo in the  last say six to twelve months and those shareholders that waited around for  this end of the Marissa Mayer deal even or the era of Marissa Mayer, that  actually got reward to shareholders because that's really one of the other  thing that I think the company is seeing moving forward but I'll tell you  what's interesting as far as Yahoo and ramping this back in the Amazon, i  mean Amazon is taking over the internet too.</p><p> I mean you look at Amazon web services, you look at all the reach that they  have now with their website and their apps, I mean a lot of these companies  that are trying to compete with Amazon whether it is in the grocery aisle,  whether it is online are really losing this battle and as I think what Mike  pointed out, Amazon is willing to go into these markets wherever it is and  lose money just to get consumers and customers just to be beat out the  competition.</p><p> CARTER:  I mean I also think though -- and I'm really curious to what you  think about this, is, is that there was some kind of a status symbol  associated with being able to afford to go to Whole Foods and what -- and I  think there's an opportunity for some of these brands to really step up and  sort of that niche that experience but they are going to have to adopt with  the time.  Do you think that there's any other brand that's going to be  able to comment and take that place?  I'm kind of wondering if the Whole  Foods brand is going to become water down now.</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes.  Well I'm seriously worried about.  And that the curious  part, I mean I'm concerned about this deal from a standpoint of and Mike  brought it up.</p><p> If he turns these into the fulfillment centers and warehouses, then what  happens?  I mean -- because I agree the -- exactly.  The Whole Foods  experience is really good.  You know what happens Maria around in Chicago,  they just have a new one that's by my house, you go there, you shop, you  have a couple of beers in the bar, you maybe watch the game.  I mean that  maybe go away now and I think that's what's interesting about this deal for  Amazon that they're making for Whole Foods, do they want to take away that  experience because to me that's the value of the shopping experience at  Whole Foods.</p><p> BAKER:  Best line I heard over the weekend was Bezos to pay cash for Whole  Foods.  Who pays cash at Whole Foods?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love that.  That's the best joke ever.</p><p> BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Best joke ever.  Go ahead Scott, you want to react?</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes.  I mean -- well you can't afford to pay cash at Whole Foods  that's why I'm a company man because if you don't have enough cash to go in  there that's why the plastic is so good.</p><p> And that's the other thing, Amazon Prime is one of the best let's say  gateway drugs in the planet with respect to what Amazon Prime does for  those who actually ends up going on Amazon and just buying more stuff  because they're Prime members.  It's similar demographic to who does shop  at Whole Foods, so there's some cross over there but how they change them  and how they manipulate that into really big sales is the question that I  have on my mind today but something that Bezos I think is going to answer  in the next couple of years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  Scott real quick, markets  are up today, you put new money to work or no?  Are you pulling back?</p><p> MARTIN:  No, I'm putting money to work Maria.  In fact, I love the tech  sector, they've beaten down the last couple of weeks because of investors  getting nervous.  That's been weak money, I think strong money is going to  come back in here towards the end of the quarter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  You agree with that Mike Murphy?</p><p> MURPHY:  I do completely.  It's opportunity here.  Market, there's a bit  under the markets goes higher.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tough first quarter for tech.  All right.  Scott, good to see  you sir.  Thank you. </p><p> MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, British Prime Minister Theresa May in the spotlight  this morning as formal negotiations for Brexit are underway.  How the  European Union is expected to respond as Britain moves to exit, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: Welcome  back!  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 19th, your top stories right now  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London is on edge, once again this morning.   At least one person has been killed and several others injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in north London; police are treating  this as a terrorist attack.  Meanwhile, Britain also focused on  negotiations for its exit from the European Union; those talks begin today  in Brussels.  We've got a lot at what's at stake.  The possibility of a  laptop ban as airlines scrambling, what it would mean for your trip to the  airport?  </p><p> And markets are rallying this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a  gain of 60 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average today at the open;  NASDAQ, strong by 35.  In Europe, markets are up across the board.  Take a  look at the indices in the Eurozone with the FTSE 100, up one-half of one  percent; and the CAC40 and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  In Asia,  overnight, mostly higher as you see across the board, actually; Nikkei  Average in Japan up two-thirds of a percent; Hang Seng Index and Hong Kong  up better one percent.  </p><p> And the Southwest facing blazing hot triple digit temperatures today,  that's not keeping tourist away though, in fact, they are flocking to Death  Valley.  We will tell you all about it.  Amazon and Wal-Mart on a collision  course for sure now, Wal-Mart announcing its own deal; what the competition  means for the company is coming up.  And the Vice President getting an  extra special Father's Day present; the Pence family welcome two new furry  members: a kitten and a puppy.  All of those stories coming up this  morning.  </p><p> First, our top stories this half an hour: Britain has been rocked by a  tragedy yet again.  London police are investigating a possible terrorist  attack outside of a mosque late last night.  Investigators say that a 40- year-old man rammed a van into a crowd injuring ten people, at least.  One  man was found dead at the scene; it is unclear, however, if that death is  related to this attack.  Prime Minister, Theresa May, is planning to hold  an emergency meeting on the case later today.  </p><p> Joining us right now: the Wall Street Journal U.K. and Brexit Editor,  Stephen Fidler.  Steven, good to have you, thanks so much for joining us.   I want to get to Britain exiting the E.U. in a moment, but first, this is  the fourth major attack in the U.K. since March; what is your reaction?  </p><p> STEPHEN FIDLER, WALL STREET JOURNAL AND BREXIT EDITOR:  Well, I think it's  certainly a surprise than worried people here.  And I think there's an  extra air of uncertainty, not only with these attacks but with the building  fire last Wednesday.  So, London, in particular, I think is feeling this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there a feeling that things need to change in terms of  security?  I mean, how are people feeling in terms of why this is  happening, why London has been under such attack just in the last three  months or so?</p><p> FIDLER:  Well, I think the - I think there is a sense that things need to  change, and there is a question that obviously the security services have  in terms of what they're going to do to deal with people who appear radical  but don't necessarily appear set of violence, you know, what to do to stop  these people going into violence.  So, that's one thing; I think there'll  be a lot of community policing and these kinds of things.  So, I would say,  you know, London has noticed this, but I was down at Borough Market despite  those attacks on London Bridge a week or so ago on Friday, and the place  was just teeming with people.  I mean, it's a - you know, London isn't  shutting down in any sense.  </p><p> LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  I'm curious what the political  environment is like there?  Here in the U.S., people say enough with the  partisanship.  It seems like the U.K. is having a very, very similar  experience right now.  And I'm just curious how people are looking at  Theresa May, and is she going to be able to lead us through this?  </p><p> FIDLER:  I think you hit on something there.  I think there is a lot of  political uncertainty, particularly given what the election result was last  - a couple weeks ago.  In a sense that she expected to come with an  increased majority; we expected to have a stronger government, and in many  ways, we have a weaker one, she doesn't even have a majority in the House  Commons.  And it looks like she's kind of uncertain in handling a lot of  these things.  You know, she hasn't been very adept at adjusting to and  dealing with the crisis as they've come one after the other.  So, I think,  you know, there is the sense of the government is, you know, not reacting  to this very well, and that she, in particular, is struggling to cope with  all of the things on her plate, you know, including the Brexit negotiation  which is starting today.  </p><p> MIKE BAKER, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIVE:  Stephen, you  just something, I think is very important, you just referred to community  policing when you talk about how we try to get ahead of the curve here.  To  what degree do you think the Met Police, or MI-5, or others had had or  having success in developing some line of communication within the Muslim  communities here in the U.K?  </p><p> FIDLER:  I think they've done that.  Obviously, they'll be looking at  what's happened and figure they haven't done it will enough, and it's one  of those things that's come into the political debate here which is whether  the cutbacks that have taken place in terms of government spending since  the financial crisis certainly have reduced the numbers of policemen and  reduced the numbers of police on the streets.  So, that sends at the  political debate with the Labour Party saying, you know, this is a  consequence of the conservative policies that there aren't as many police  on the street as they used to be in, and the community policing that used  to go on five years ago or so, isn't happening to the same degree now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to be watching that.  That's a really  important point to bring up.  Let me switch gears and ask you about talks  officially underway now for Britain to leave the European Union; what are  you expecting here, Stephen, in terms of David Davis-the Brexit Secretary- meeting with the E.U.'s Chief Negotiator in Brussels; that meeting  happening right now.  David said that you're determined to build a strong  partnership.  Listen to this; I want to get your reaction.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DAVID DAVIS, BREXIT SECRETARY:  There's more that unites us than divides  us.  So, while we were ghastly to be, challenging times ahead of us in the  negotiations, we will do all we can to assure that we deliver that works in  the best interest of all citizens.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there are concerns that Prime Minister  Theresa May's government is too fragile when she the majority in the snap  election two weeks ago.  Their growing calls for her to drop her plan of  the hard exit out of the E.U.; what are your thoughts here?  How does this  play out?  </p><p> FIDLER:  Well, it's a - I think a when Theresa May called an election in  April, there was a feeling in Europe, in Brussel that, OK, we're going to  have a stronger leader in the U.K. that can deliver on the promises she  makes in the negotiations.  So, that hasn't happened.  So, I think on the  other side of the, you know, from European Union perspective, there is sort  of, you know, a lot questions about who they're dealing, and whether this  woman is going to be in charge six months from now, and whether they should  make concessions in negotiations with someone who might not be around for a  very long.  </p><p> And on the other hand, as you say, in the U.K., she less able to deliver on  the promises, you know, because the House of Commons is divided, as some of  their own party don't want the kind of hard  Brexit.  And you know, it's  possible that the House of Commons or the House of Lords, which is the  unelected second chamber could overturn a lot of what she's trying to do.   So, I think we're entering these negotiations only 21 months to go before  the U.K. leaves the E.U. in a very uncertain situation.  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF VENTURES FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Stephen,  it's Mike Murphy, I would think of these recent attacks that's in the U.K.  that the people who are going to be voting would want to be more for  Brexit, so that they could kind of control their borders, and maybe be  safer as a group.  Do you see that gaining any momentum kind of the pro- Brexit crowd because of the recent attacks?  </p><p> FIDLER:  I don't see that as a - the opinion polls don't seem to show that.   I mean, there is an element of that in the discussions.  I mean, you know,  even in the European Union, the UK. could - you know, they're always  possible controls from other people coming in for the U.K.  So, it's not  quite true to say the U.K. didn't control these borders.  What it had an  issue with was people coming into, and working in the U.K. from other parts  of the European Union, and the U.K. could say, quote his answer.  So, I  think there's a slightly different questionnaire, and I think from the  other side of the coin is the state of the British economy.  I mean, the  pound fell very sharply after the referendum last year.  Inflation is  starting to feed through, and people are fighting their standard of living  being eroded.  So, maybe that the sorts of an anti-Brexit crowd are kind of  getting a little more growing, somewhat, because of concerns about the  economy.  </p><p> BAKER:  Stephen, Mike Baker here again, do you feel that comment of David  Davis is correct when he said that there's more that unites the U.K. with  U.E. and then divides you?  </p><p> FIDLER:  I think there's a -- there's a sense in both - in which both sides  want a good deal out of this.  I don't think it's in any - nobody thinks  it's in their interest, but this all blows up and that's a sort of a big  break, or at least very few people think that's a - that's a great idea.   So, I think that's true.  I think that the thing that's left unsaid and  really that the U.K. hasn't held its answer is what actually do they  (INAUDIBLE) from this new relationship.  And certainly, some of the things  that they've outlined don't seem to be likely to be agreed on the other  side.  So, I think the - actually, the E.U. said much more about what it's  -- how it's going to approach the negotiations than the U.K. - than the  U.K. has.  There are a lot of unanswered questions about what the U.K.  really is looking for out of all of this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stephen, then new developments in France, newly elected  President, Emanuel Macron consolidating power.  His party obviously winning  a clear majority in parliament overnight what does this victory mean for  the E.U.?</p><p> FIDLER:  It's interesting because it's contrast very much with what's going  on in the U.K., where you have - you have a leadership that is weakened.   Now, we've had this guy coming almost from nowhere in a year, creating a  political movement, becoming the President of France and gaining a huge  majority in the parliament to push through the kind of things that he said  he wants to do, which is including reforming the French slave market.  So,  I think the narrative in which the U.K. went into the sort of referendum  which was a declining European Union and sort of strengthening Britain.   That sort of - that kind of mood music has changed because I think the --  to some extent, anyway, and I wouldn't want to exaggerate this, the E.U.  has got its mojo back partly thanks to, what, some Macron who was a very  pro-E.U. candidate is doing, and also the fact that Angela Merkel looks as  if she's going to come back as chancellor, possibly with, you know,  increased majority or an increased size of her party.</p><p> So, in a sense, you know, it looks like the E.U. is sort of moving forward  to an extent that we didn't expect a year ago.  I mean, Macron's problem is  going to be not in the parliament now.  The question is going to be, what  happens in the streets?  How are they going to react?  The trade unions and  others, how are they going to react to what he's trying to do in the labor  market and to reform the economy?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's an important point, and that obviously becomes  clearer over the months and days to come.  Stephen, great to get your  insights.  Thanks so much.  Stephen Fidler joining us this morning in  London.</p><p> FIDLER:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Boeing takes flight with a new plane.  How the  jetliner could rub up competition against rival, Airbus.  Stock has been on  fire of Boeing.  Then, Vice President Mike Pence ads some four-legged  friends to his family.  Their cute new pet social media debut, straight  ahead.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher this morning.  Take a  look at Futures indicating a pretty good rally at the opening of trading.   68 points higher on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  We're watching a  couple of names for you.  Boeing unveiled its first new jet in four years.   The company will develop a bigger 737.  Boeing says 10 customers have  already committed to buying that plane.  The announcement coming at the  Paris air show as the jetmaker looks to take on rising competition from  Airbus.</p><p> We are watching the banks this morning, including JPMorgan Chase.  The  Federal Reserve is set to release the latest result of the stress test  beginning Thursday this week.  Investors are hoping that the banks will get  approval to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends.  And U.S.  Airlines gearing up for the possibility of an expanded ban of carryon  laptops.  Cheryl Casone on that detail right now.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria, we were thinking  that we might get news like this.  So, that initial ban that was put into  effect in May by the U.S. and the U.K. did affect some flights from the  Middle East and North Africa.  A ban now under consideration by the Trump  administration would involve flights originating for as many as 71 airports  around the world.  Big expansion.  That would mean additional security  checks and most likely a lot of angry international customers.  </p><p> Well, we're watching an extreme heat wave happening right now as out in the  southwest, parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah all really  suffering.  Temperatures expected to climb well above 110 degrees this week  in several parts of that region.  Death Valley, that's the hottest place in  America could see, get this, 124 degrees tomorrow.  And we are told that  some tourists actually finding to go there to experience Death Valley in  124 degrees.  No, not a smart idea.  </p><p> All right.  Another headlines this morning.  Good God.  Wal-Mart is going  shopping for an online retailer.  The company - this actually went down on  Friday, Maria, is buying Bonobos, they sell men's clothing for $310 million  in cash.  Now, this deal coming as Wal-Mart takes on Amazon for the future  of retail, and of course, it's on the same date that Amazon announced the  big deal, of course, to buy whole foods.  Wal-Mart has been moving  aggressively to try and transform himself into a major e-commerce power.   They bought jet.com last year for more than $3 billion (AUDIO GAP) today as  you could see on your chart under pressure, though, this morning.</p><p> And then, Vice President Mike Pence celebrated Father's Day by adding two  new members to the family.  The Pences welcomed a new kitten and dog into  their home.  The V.P.'s daughter, Charlotte, posted pictures of the new  addition, Charlie and Hazel.  They replaced the Pence's beagle, Maverick,  who died shortly before for the election.  And then (INAUDIBLE) of a cat,  Oreo, who passed away earlier this month.  They joined Pickles, another  family cat, by the way.  And they also have a bunny, Maria, named Marilyn  Van Dough.  They love (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Marilyn, Hazel, Pickles.  I love it.  I love it. </p><p> CARTER:  I always trust people who - I always trust people who love animals  more than those that's -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Me, too.  That's great.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are on this story, ladies and gentlemen.  For all  new Mike Pence pet news, you (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of pets.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  fighting crime and making a return on your investment at the same time.   Why superhero comic books are trending at the auction block.  We'll tell  you about it, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  May 2017 was a win for comic books with $48.2  million worth of merchandise ordered.  This after comic book sales had a  20-year sales record last August who was (INAUDIBLE) by the success of both  the Marvel and D.C. Film Universes.  Joining me right now is  ComicConnect.com COO, Vincent Zurzolo.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much  for being here.</p><p> VINCENT ZURZOLO, COMICCONNECT.COM CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, your auction of nearly 18,000 comics just closed last  night.  How did it go?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  We had a record week last week.  Closed from Monday through  Friday last week, and preauction estimated were $4 to $5 million.  We broke  $7 million on the auction.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Yes.  We can make the -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think is behind this obsession with comic books  that we have.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Well, I think people are very nostalgic and they're trying to  recapture the happiest times of their life, their childhood.  But I also  think it has a lot to do with the - that comic books have become  commodities.  They are all encapsulated in hard plastic holders from CGC  grading company which is the world's largest grading company.  And they are  encapsulated in these comic book holders, and it makes people who don't  know how to grade a comic book makes them able to buy and sell comic books.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because actually we're looking - I  was thinking, yes, there is that, that we want to relive our childhood, and  I'm thinking, \"Well, that's really wholesome, right?\"  But some comics are  not wholesome.  I've seen a lot of comics.  My husband likes comic books.   And some of these comic books get serious.  I mean, it's not so wholesome.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Well, they're not all for little kids.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Exactly.  Like my husband.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  You know, so there are - there you go.  Exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what is the attraction, do you think?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  So, I think it's nostalgia, I think it's this idea that you -  it's a form of entertainment, it's escapism, it's a form of investing.   People are not so in love with - I think nowadays ever since the recession,  traditional forms of investment.  They have to have - become their own type  of investor.  So, they look at things they love, tangible assets like  vintage comic books.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And one of them that you brought in was the comic in which  Superman appears for the second time.  Let's look at that one here.  How  much does that one go for at all?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  This comic book, the second cover appearance of Superman went for  $188,000.  What's important about this is, this is the court case copy.   This was used when D.C. Comics sued Fox who had made an intimation Superman  back in the 40s, 30s and 40s.  And -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's show that one.  That's this one right here.  Yes.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Because if you the stamp, the court case stamp.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So this is the court case stamp.  Wow.  Because they made a  Superman -</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Yes, Wonderman who was kind of a rip off from Superman.  But this  is the comic book that sold for the most in our auction is the first  appearance of Superman in action comics number one.  Now, my company holds  records, world record.  We sold the first million-dollar comic book, 1.5,  2.2, and over 3 million.  This copy is conserved.  It has a little bit of  conservation done to it to maintain the structural integrity.  This comic  book, we estimated to sell for about $200 to $250,000, sold for $393,000.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  What -- now what does a collector do with that?   Just keep it covered and it's just - that's the price.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  I think it's in their safe or something like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  $300,000 for a comic?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  $393,000.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Almost 400 grand for this cover.  Batman, a  significant character in D.C. Comics.  Why did that one bring in such a  large amount of money?  Tell us about the Batman.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  So, Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman.  This  comic book is actually restored.  If it wasn't restored, it would sell for  over a million dollars easy.  This comic we estimated to sell for about 200  to 250.  It sold for $313,000.  People love Batman, they love Superman.   These are two of the biggest characters in the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  But what about characters today?  Are there new  characters that have emerged today that perhaps could command these kinds  of numbers? </p><p> ZURZOLO:  You know, there's a comic book that came out.  You might have  heard of it, The Walking Dead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Well, it's a huge T.V. show.  Walking dead is huge.  That's  comic book in perfect condition.  The number one copy can sell for over  $3,000, which is really exciting.  Our company will be bringing the world's  best collection of Walking Dead to auction later this year to coincide with  New York Comic-Con as well as an original art collection that's going to  blow the minds of many people around the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And how do you choose something like that, Walking Dead.  Why  did you think Walking Dead would be a good thing?</p><p> ZURZOLO:  I never did.  You know, it's not my market.  But I started  reading them and a comic book done in black and white that was done so  effectively.  It was just amazing.  When you read the original comic book,  you understand why it's become a worldwide phenomenon.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fascinating.  Vincent, great to have you.  Thanks so much for  walking us through it.  </p><p> ZURZOLO:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Vincent Zurzolo there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  Congressman Steve Scalise's condition has improved.  He is upgraded from  critical to serious, just coming after he was shoot last week during  baseball practice with other Republican lawmakers.  The details next hour.   MORNINGS WITH MARIA back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th.  Here are  your top stories 7 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> Breaking news this morning.  London on edge again.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p>In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p>BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p>BAKER:  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p>They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p>A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p>Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p>And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p>So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p>And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p>Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p>Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p>And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p>BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p>BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p>I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p>CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p>MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p>KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p>BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p>KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p>KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p>KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p>Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.  What we know about the attacker this morning.   Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.  </p><p>Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues.  The  Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire  Whole Foods.  The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning!  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p>And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.

Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p>WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p>PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p>But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p>PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na[ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p>MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p>BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p>PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p>We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p>MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p>BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p>And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p>CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p>CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday June 19.</p><p>Here are your top stories 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning: London on edge again.  At least one person has  been killed, several others injured after a man plowed his van into a crowd  near a mosque in northern London.  British Prime Minister Theresa May  addressing the attack moments ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  This morning, our country woke to  news of another terrorist attack on the streets of our capital city; the  second this month and every bit as sickening as those which have come  before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to London straight ahead to get the  latest there.</p><p>Meanwhile, YouTube taking steps to combat extremism.  Details on the  company's new policies coming up.</p><p>Technology executives are descending on the White House today.  Top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's IT system for a  meeting at the White House with the President.  Among the CEOs attending:  Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, IBM CEO Ginny Rometty among  others.</p><p>Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading today -- take a look.   Markets are at the highs of the morning right now.  Dow Industrials  expected to be up 70 points.  Nasdaq up almost 40 points right now --  that's two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>In Europe, gains across the board as well to report.  The FT 100 in London  up two-thirds of a percent.  The CAC 40 in Paris up almost 1 percent.  The  DAX index as well.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets close higher also.  The Hang Seng in Hong Kong  best performer -- up better than 1 percent.</p><p>And Brooks Koepka makes a name for himself at the U.S. Open. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Koepka -- our major champion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he became the third straight American to win the U.S.  Open.  We've got all the highlights.</p><p>What's old is new again apparently.  Atari makes a comeback with a new  console.  This is the first new console in 20 years.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it: the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter is here; the CEO of  Rosecliff Mike Murphy is here; and the president of Diligence Mike Baker is  here.  Great to see you.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot on deck today.</p><p>BAKER:  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Sure is.  Some great guests, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got important guests coming up to talk about what's  going on in London.  We're going to take you live to London momentarily.</p><p>The story out of the White House this morning in terms of technology and  Mike these markets are looking firmer.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Firm, new highs and I think there is a bit  underneath the market.  A lot of negatives out there but the market, as  they say, finds a wall of worry and that's what we're getting right now --  earnings supporting higher prices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning: the counselor to  President Trump Kellyanne Conway is here -- don't miss that.  She's coming  up this hour.</p><p>First though new questions surrounding whether President Trump is actually  under investigation or not by the special counsel looking into Russia's  alleged election meddling.</p><p>On Friday the President tweeted this.  \"I'm being investigated for firing  the FBI director by the man who told me to fired the FBI director.  Witch  hunt.\"</p><p>But yesterday a member of the President's legal team contradicted that  tweet.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, MEMBER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM:  The President has not  been notified by anyone that he is under investigation.  That tweet, Chris  was in response to the \"Washington Post\" story that alleged that five  unnamed sources, anonymous sources linked to the \"Washington Post\" that the  President was in fact under investigation.  So that tweet was in response  to that.  </p><p>There has been no notification of any investigation.  Nothing has changed  since James Comey said the President was not a target or a subject of  investigation.  Nothing's changed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst right now,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- good to see.  Good morning.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on all of this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I think it's a little bit in the weeds because if you  have the former FBI director making a case for attempted obstruction of  justice or even bribery against the President of the United States and  making it in a fairly forceful way.  Whatever you think of him as an FBI  director, that is certainly enough to trigger an investigation.</p><p>So I think both sides are right.  I think that the President is being  investigated but he is not a target.  A target means they plan to bring  charges against you.  So when Jay Sekulow says he hasn't gotten a target  letter that it's probably technically true but it doesn't mean that he's  not been investigated.</p><p>State differently the FBI must investigate allegations of the nature and  quality that James Comey alleged in that senate testimony that he gave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I don't know why the President feels the need to respond  to something like a \"Washington Post\" report.  He calls them fake news  anyway.  So why respond?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he has had tremendous success in energizing  his base -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  I know.  I get that.  I get that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- with his tweets.  No human being in the modern era has had  the success that he has in communicating with his supporters and bypassing  the media.</p><p>But this is a dangerous area for him because we now see federal judges  taking literally Sean Spicer's statement.  The President's tweets official  government communications and federal judges using statements made in the  tweets to undermine oral arguments that his Justice Department is making in  court.</p><p>So he at times while undermining the base may be working at cross purposes  with what his Justice Department is trying to persuade federal judges.</p><p>BAKER:  This may not be a fair question, Judge but what is your gut  feeling?  Where is this going?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know.  I wish I did.  I don't know where it's going  but I do believe that -- as I just said to all of you -- the allegations  that James Comey made were said with such credibility and confidence that  they can't be ignored and they will investigated.</p><p>Now, here is a good side of this.  Sometimes the FBI in the early stages  before you are a subject down here, before you're a target up here you are  sort of in the mix.  They may want to exclude certain people from becoming  subjects and targets and in order to do that they have to conduct an  investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I think we should start looking at where the real  obstructionism has been in that where we know it was.  Senate Republicans  are now turning their attention and their investigative eyes to former  attorney general Loretta Lynch.  Some are saying that they want her to  testify after alarming accusations by the former director, Jim Comey, in  his recent congressional testimony.</p><p>Here is one thing he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  At one point the Attorney General had  directed me not to call it an \"investigation\" but instead to call it a  \"matter\" which confused me and concerned me.  But that was one of the  bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the  department if we are going to close this case credible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was one of three things people are talking about in  terms of why Loretta Lynch needs to be investigated.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Number one, the matter versus investigation.  Number two, the  tarmac meeting -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- two days before Hillary Clinton was to testify, she met with  her husband President Clinton on the plane.</p><p>And number three, apparently there is a memo floating around that has not  been widely disseminated but basically says -- suggests that Loretta Lynch  I will be getting involved.  I'll make sure the FBI investigation of  Clinton doesn't go too far.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Now, we don't know if this memo exists.  But the reports on  the memo are the recipient of it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- the then chair of the Democratic National Committee.  Now  this was back before the DNC, when Bernie Sanders' candidacy was still  alive and Mrs. Clinton had not yet been exonerated by Jim Comey.  Just as I  said that Comey painted enough of a serious case against the President to  warrant investigation by the special prosecutor.</p><p>He clearly painted enough of a case against Loretta Lynch to be  investigated by not the senate judiciary committee but the same FBI, the  regular FBI, the Justice Department -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and not the special prosecutor.</p><p>Now, it is odd and has only happened in rare instances that an attorney  general investigates his predecessor.  It happened, of course when John  Mitchell, Richard Nixon's Attorney General was prosecuted and convicted and  went to jail.  </p><p>But I am telling you there are enough allegations stated in a credible way,  supported by other forensic evidence like we saw pictures of her with Bill  Clinton -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- to warrant a criminal investigation of Mrs. Lynch for  misconduct in office.  Did she use the Justice Department as a political  instrument to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not to mention all of the spying that went on and the  unmasking.  Then there's that.  I am just throwing this out there because  there is a fair amount of things out there to investigate -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- at this point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  but remember, this is not Bob Mueller.  This is Jeff Sessions  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and whoever is running.  It is still Andrew McCabe because  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- Christopher Wray has not yet been confirmed.  It is the  regular DOJ that should be investigating her.</p><p>BAKER:  What I worry and this is what happens in Washington it seems like  all the time which is all these various issues now get molded together, the  public becomes utterly confused over where we're going with this.  And  eventually it all goes away and dies.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now it gives the impression of either scandal or  instability, neither of which is good to give that impression coming from  the Justice Department which is supposed to be relatively neutral -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- doing the right thing, enforcing the rule of law devoid of  politics and above the fray.  It doesn't seem to be that way right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I brought up the memo because there is also  speculation that is totally fake -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- I mean does it exist or not.  We don't know.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  We do know that the \"matter\" thing is true because -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The \"matter\" is true.  He testified under oath.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You'll get a peek at this because Mike -- you live in this  environment.  FBI agents were poking the director in the ribs saying,  you're now the director of the federal bureau of matters.  It's a criminal  investigation -- where is this \"matter\" nonsense coming from? </p><p>BAKER:  We've got to change the logo.  It's going to cost money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. Let's talk about a case that has really rocked  Hollywood and that is, of course, Bill Cosby; a shocking outcome to the  Bill Cosby sexual assault trial yesterday.  The judge declared a mistrial  after the jury was deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberation.</p><p>Judge -- what does this mean for the case against the comedian?  Walk us  through what a mistrial looks like.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  A judge must determine that no further deliberation time is  likely to change anybody's opinion.  Now we don't know if it's 11 to 1 or 6  to 6 or some combination.  Obviously you need unanimity for a conviction  and unanimity for acquittal.  And they didn't have unanimity.</p><p>Some judges will just ask the jury foreman, can you tell me Madam Foreman,  whether or not in your opinion any further deliberation will help.  Some  judges -- this is what I used to do were asked each individual juror.   Don't tell me how you're voting.  That's none of my business.  I want to  know if you still have an open mind or if you are steadfast and nothing  else will change that opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And once the judge comes to that conclusion well then it's  simply a waste of time.  The prosecutors have announced that they will  retry him probably in the fall or the winter.</p><p>This is a very, very strange case because he received a promise, Bill  Cosby, from a prosecutor don't worry you're not going to be prosecuted you  can give a deposition into what happened.  He gave the deposition, the  prosecutor died.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The new prosecutor can -- the judge said, the promise is only  good for as long as he's the prosecutor.  So they can use your own words  against you.  That's called a built-in appeal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is extraordinary.  That's incredible.  </p><p>Judge -- thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great insights as always from you.  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>The U.K. authorities are now investigating that van attack near the London  mosque early this morning as a possible terrorist attack.  </p><p>Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is on the ground in  London right now with the very latest.  Benjamin -- good morning to you.</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you  from London.  Well, yet another attack hitting London over here but, of  course, what it so s strikingly different in this case is that this was an  attack on Muslims.  Of course, we have seen vehicles being used time and  time again.  But not like this.</p><p>And as you said, this is now being treated as an act of terrorism and  investigated by the counter terrorism unit.  It happened just after  midnight here in Finchley, north London outside a Muslim center.  At a time  when the neighborhood was crowded with Muslims finishing Ramadan prayers.   It seems that the attacker knew when prayers ended and he was waiting.</p><p>Muslim leaders have now called it a hate crime and they've asked the public  to stay calm and try to avoid divisions within the community.</p><p>Police have arrested the driver.  He's a 48-year-old white man.    He was  grappled to the ground by two bystanders until the police could arrive.   Those two men are being called heroes.</p><p>Eyewitnesses have also reported that he said a number of times \"I've done  my bit\" and \"I want to kill Muslims.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He did what he did deliberately to hit and kill as many  Muslims as possible.  So he is a terrorist.  So at this stage we are  calling for calm.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HALL:  And the video has also emerged showing the attacker apparently  blowing a kiss from the police van that he was been taken away.  He's been  taken to the hospital.  He's going to be charged when he is let out of  there.</p><p>But a lot of people are saying this is exactly what ISIS wanted.   (inaudible) the narrative.  It helps to create even greater divisions.  And  so right here where we are now in London very much on edge.  It's a very  multi-ethnic, very diverse neighborhood and the police really are just  trying to keep it safe, keep it under control.  The Prime Minister coming  out as well and saying this was not only an attack on this community.  It  was an attack on the whole of the country.  Back to you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Benjamin -- thank you.  Benjamin Hall will get back  to you as news develops there.</p><p>Coming up -- Google cracks down on terrorism -- how technology giant says  it is combating the spread of extremism on YouTube.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The acting secretary of the Navy has promised a  full investigation into a collision between the destroyer a container ship  off of the coast of Japan.  It killed seven sailors.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the story now -- Cheryl</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria -- of course the story  developing over the weekend.  That collision happened early Saturday  morning as many of the crew slept.  Secretary Sean Stackley praised the  crewmembers for saving the USS Fitzgerald from further damage and bringing  it back into part.  And of course, the sad story is they find those  sailors.</p><p>Representative Steve Scalise's condition, we should say, has now been  upgraded to serious from critical.  According to Medstar Washington  Hospital Center, the congressman had more surgery over the weekend but he  does continue to show signs of improvement.  </p><p>And Scalise did not let his health crisis get in the way of father's day.   He said on the father's day message on twitter, saying quote, \"Steve's  greatest joy is being a father to Madison and Harrison and a husband to  Jennifer.  This father for the Scalise family and they send their best  wishes to every family especially the dads.  Take the time to be close to  the ones that you love.</p><p>Of course Scalise, one of five people wounded last week when a gunman  opened fire on Republicans at a baseball practice in suburban, Virginia.</p><p>Well, tomorrow's special election in Georgia.  It's too close to call.  And  the two candidates are scrambling for last-minute votes.  The race between  Republican Karen Handle and Democratic Jon Ossoff is seen as a key test for  Republican swing voters, uneasy with President Trump's policies.  </p><p>And Atari is back in the hardware business.  The company says it's making a  video game console for the first time in more than 20 years.  It's called  the Atari box, Some of the world's most iconic video games ran of course,  on Atari including Pong, Pac-Man.  Atari filed for bankruptcy in 2013.   They emerged here later as the company focused on mobile and online games  but the company says that Atari box is based on PC technology.  As a kid  always playing Atari -- bring it on back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bring back Pac-Man.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm ready for that.</p><p>BAKER:  I put a lot of quarters into the Pong machine -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How cool we are?</p><p>MURPHY:  It's fantastic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pong, Pac-Man.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  I bought my three little boys Scooter, Slughorn (ph) and  Mugsie (ph).  I bought them an old Atari and they love this thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BAKER:  And I was worried.  I thought they're going to look at it and go,  \"are you kidding me\".  They loved it.</p><p>MURPHY:  They take the Atari over the iPhone?</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not your kids.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not your kids.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your kids are not taking Atari over the iPhone.</p><p>MURPHY:  They need the iPhone 7.  The 6 isn't even good enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.  All right.  We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, Google takes new measures to combat the rise of  terrorism online.  The technology giant's new plan to crack down on  extremist contents on YouTube.  We've got it.</p><p>Then Lockheed soars ahead of the massive fighter jet deal.  The aircraft  maker agreeing to sell $37 billion worth of F-35s to nearly a dozen  countries.  Take a look at how investors are reacting to the news.</p><p>Boeing stock also on fire.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>YouTube ramps up efforts to restrict the amount of extremist content on the  site.  </p><p>Tracee Carrasco has the details now.  Tracee -- good morning to you.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>Now the parent company of Google says it is working to remove all videos  that violate YouTube's community guidelines such as those promoting  terrorism.  YouTube will increase technology and the number of experts to  flag terrorist-related content and videos that do not meet grounds for  removal but still promote offensive viewpoints will come with a warning and  will not be able to be recommended, endorsed or commented on by users  making them harder to find.  </p><p>YouTube will also use targeted online advertising to reach potential ISIS  recruits and then redirect them towards anti-terrorism videos that can  change their minds about joining.  A spokesperson for Google says quote,  \"There should be no place for terrorist content on our services.\"</p><p>The changes come after reports that one of the suspects in the London  Bridge terror attack became radicalized after watching pro-ISIS videos on  YouTube.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have faced harsh criticism for not  doing enough to remove extremist content from their Web sites.  </p><p>It is a daunting task with, you know, over 400 videos uploaded per minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For a long time these companies, YouTube included, were getting  criticized for not doing enough.  Do you see this as enough.</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  I don't but I don't know what the answer is.  I think  somehow someway extremists are going to figure out a way to get their  message out there.</p><p>I don't know if these companies can actually do enough to stop it, if they  can do anything to stop it because I think the terrorists will get around  it someway.</p><p>BAKER:  This is an advantage.  This is actually a good move.  I agree, it's  not going to solve the problem entirely.  But it is in combination with a  variety of other things including locating, identifying and taking them  out.  This sort of step is also very helpful.</p><p>CARTER:  But I can't help but wonder, I mean with all the big data  advancements and they know who the target audiences are that are on their  sights, what they're interested in so they can serve up advertisement.  How  can they not know what else is going on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's a good point you make because they've got  all these measurement tools -- </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to track everything else.  How come they can't track this  better?</p><p>CARTER:  When they could give me an advertisement on what I want why can't  they say, do you want something bad.</p><p>BAKER:  They could.  They could.  But you know what that means.  That means  changing laws.</p><p>MURPHY:  Censorship. </p><p>BAKER:  That's right.  And if they -- </p><p>MURPHY:  You're giving up something for getting something.  I'm not saying  we don't.  I think we should be more aggressive.  But that is a bigger  conversation.</p><p>CARTER:  But giving up a privacy to be told to.  I mean why not for  security.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's all important issues to bring up.</p><p>Tracee -- thank you.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p>Coming up -- Pushing ahead with President Trump's agenda.  We'll talk to  the White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway about that agenda.

Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us. </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 19.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>London on edge once again -- a man ploughs his van into a crowd outside of  a mosque and is in police custody this morning.  Authorities are  investigating the incident as a terrorist attack.</p><p>Meanwhile news questions about the Russia probe -- whether President Trump  is actually under investigation at all despite his recent tweets.</p><p>Technology leaders are descending on the White House today.  The first  meeting of the Technology Advisory Council convenes late this afternoon  focusing on the government's IT system; among those attending Apple's CEO  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Amazon's Jeff Bezos among others.</p><p>While all of this is happening at the White House Congress is focused on  the agenda.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that he wants  healthcare done by the Fourth of July.  Senator Marco Rubio says speed  should not be the priority.  Here's what he told me yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I would rather us do it right than do it  fast because no matter what passes, if it isn't good or it has some  unintended consequence the President is going to be held responsible for  that.  Republicans are going to be held responsible for that.  Let's not  repeat the mistakes the Democrats made.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a closer look at the legislative agenda coming up.</p><p>Markets are rallying today, kicking off the week strongly -- Dow  Industrials at the highs of the morning right now up to 75 points.  Nasdaq  up almost 40.</p><p>In Europe the indices are also higher across the board; up between half a  percent and 1 percent the CAC 40 up almost 1 percent this morning in Paris. </p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks finished higher there as well.  Take a look --  Japan did well, up two-thirds of a percent.  Hong Kong up better than 1  percent.</p><p>Brooks Koepka wins the U.S. Open, his first ever major championship  victory.  We've got the highlights of the U.S. Open this morning.</p><p>And Olympic Great, Michael Phelps taking on new competition, get this,  details on his race against the great white shark.  How's that going to  work?  We will tell you about it. </p><p>First, our top story this half hour right now, tragedy strikes London  again, British authorities now saying a suspect has been detained after a  van plowed into a crowd of worshipers near a Mosque in Northern London  early this morning.  According to London police they are treating this as a  possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at the scene though it's  unclear if his death was actually related to the attack.  Ten others were  wounded, the driver, a 48-year-old man arrested at the scene after being  detained by members of the public.  According to some reports witnesses  said that the driver was heard shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.</p><p>Joining me right now is Counsel to the president, Kellyanne Conway.   Kellyanne, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, U.S. PRESIDENT:  It's a pleasure Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  We've got extra security  measures being taken, people are worried.  Do you expect we'll see extra  security measures taken in the U.S. as a result of what went on in London?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well the president and his counterterrorism team assess this  situation throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were  concerned with their British counterparts and since it looks like the  British government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll  wait to see how that investigation unfolds.</p><p>And where we support our allies anyway that they need, we just don't want  this to become the new normal where people feel like they're changing the  behavior, their lifestyles, their lives indeed Maria and allowing the  terrorists in any form to win and to prevail.  And so we know that people  are very concerned about national security, it's in large part how the  president won.  He just frankly put out the more masculine, more robust  antiterrorism program whether it's (inaudible) strength or him wanting ISIS  to be in retreat.  Hillary Clinton referred to them as our, \"determined  enemies\" at her convention speech so I think there's a huge contrast.  And  you're seeing that play out now where the president is constantly talking  about how his first response really to this nation is our safety and  security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he really did.  And I think that's why it's just a head  scratch as far as why he gets this pushback on the travel ban and  everything else.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are new questions surrounding whether or not the president  is actually under investigation or not by the Special Counsel looking into  Russia's alleged election meddling.  On Friday the president tweeted out  this, \"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who  told me to fire the FBI Director!  Witch Hunt.\"  And then yesterday, a  member of the president's legal team contradicted the tweet.  Kellyanne, is  the president under investigation?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well I don't think Jay Sekulow, the president (inaudible)  contradicting the tweet, I think he explained it.  What Mr. Sekulow said is  that is that the president is constrained by the 140 characters in Twitter.</p><p>The president uses his social media platform to communicate directly with  the people as you know Maria.  But that Jay Sekulow, his per -- one of his  personal lawyers said the president has not been notified that he's under  investigation.  In fact, Mr. Comey testified that the president is not the  president said in the letter where he dismissed Mr. Comey in May, that  Comey had told him three times that he wasn't under investigation, they've  not been notified otherwise.  His personal lawyer would know this.</p><p>And it's important to say that because what the president was reacting to  in that particular social media message was the Washington Post report that  was based on five anonymous seekers, anonymous sources that must have been  leaked that he's somehow under investigation.  His lawyer is saying no he's  not.  So I think he's explaining that the president is really pointing out  the irony of everything and the last part of his tweet is the most  important which is that he consider this to be a witch hunt.</p><p>We've been doing this for many, many months now having an investigation,  where's the collusion?  Where's the obstruction of justice?  Where's the  evidence that supports this conclusion and we have separate, what, five or  six different separate congressional investigations going on and we've been  doing this for eight to nine months, I mean you could have a baby in this  time and they have no evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, I have been very adamant about this as well from the  beginning saying, look, this is a -- it looks like a completely  manufactured story.  Russia has been hacking, it has been undermining the  U.S. and the West for decades, why attach the president to that he has  nothing to do with it?</p><p>However, why respond to the Washington Post do you think Kellyanne?  I mean  the president has rightly so called some of the news out there fake news  and in many cases the president was right, why respond to the Washington  Post?  I mean the idea of tweeting, I understand he's speaking directly to  the American people, people like it and it's been a good strategy for him.   But can you convince him or ask him why he's not tweeting about the agenda?   Why he's not tweeting about other -- why bring up the Russia story and  respond to the Washington Post when this is a news organization he's called  fake news anyway.</p><p>CONWAY:  So here's where everybody has to wake up each morning and make  their own choices.  The media could cover all of his tweets and if they did  that, they would see that he more often tweets about agenda items than  other matters.  </p><p>He has this constant stream on Instagram, on Facebook, on Twitter, his big  social media platform where he says reaches about 100 million people,  Maria.  And you had the entire day in Cuba the other day where he rolled  back these awful rules that Obama put in place that allowed the Cuban  Regime not the Cuban people to benefit financially.  We had the first  meeting at the White House with the Opioid Commission on Friday.  Earlier  in the week the president did workforce development and apprenticeship  week, that's all on Twitter.</p><p>This week he'll be meeting with the -- today he'll be meeting with the tech  CEOs.  Last week he also sign some things into laws and the EOs that  benefit people, benefit workers.  All of that goes on to his Twitter feed  when he has a bilateral.  He's hosted I think more than 20 now with the  White House with foreign leaders but people don't want to cover that, they  want to cover -- they're very selective in the different tweets they want  to cover.  So he -- I'm telling you, the American people see all of the  social media platforms.  They're sort of saying attention saying, \"Wow,  he's going to put all this money and all this force in effect of the White  House behind apprenticeship programs where those who go through at  apprenticeship program the Department of Labor say they get -- they're 90  percent get employed immediately and they make an average of $60,000 per  year.</p><p>So we want to dignify all types of career paths, all types of jobs, the  welders, the hairdressers, the plumbers, the carpenters, people who get a  high school diploma and a skill certificate.  All of that's on the social  media platform, they just don't want to cover it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I think that's a fair point.  I mean, but there is  criticism that the president brings up things that he doesn't really need  to.  I mean does he create some obstacles for himself by bringing up some  of the things that perhaps the supporters don't believe anyway?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well in this case though he -- first of all, he's the president of  all Americans and he made that clear beginning on November 9th and he's  never wavered from that.  </p><p>People who criticize him and even deny that the legitimacy of his  presidency will benefit from his tax cut, they will benefit from better  healthcare, they will be benefit from infrastructure, they will benefit  from ISIS in retreat, they will benefit from the regulatory framework being  chipped away because it's impeding our pocketbook in a personal liberty  issues.  But Maria, the fact that the president feels he has a right to  defend himself on occasion.</p><p>He's watching a one-sided witch hunt as he refers to it because it's not  like if we're in a court of law and you're watching people -- you're  watching one side and it's a prosecution rest and here comes the defense,  it doesn't work that way.  You got Comey testifying without anybody  responding in front of 20 million people.  You've got outlet after outlet  that's still criticizing him that is against him, that's part of the  \"resistance and obstruction.\"  You got an entire democratic party and their  presidential nominee (inaudible)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about what the president could do but let  me get to this because the president has added John Dowd, a veteran lawyer  in Washington to his legal team.  Is the president preparing for a legal  battle?  Is that why he is upping the number of people on the legal team?   Tell us what he's expecting.</p><p>CONWAY:  Well he's always been a prepared man.  He's a very smart  businessman, among the smartest, most successful.  </p><p>And he's just somebody who surrounds himself with the best and the  brightest and he's doing that here as well.  What he's preparing for is  what we already know exist which is this investigation that's ongoing --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The witch hunt is what he calls it.</p><p>CONWAY:  Witch hunt.  But it continues forward for now and he's just  preparing himself for that.  And I know a number of these attorneys and  they're all very talented and they all have different types of expertise.</p><p>And I think the most important thing is that they understand their client  in this case and that they protect him and they avail him of every possible  resource in him defending himself, he has the right to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I think the left has been really driving this  narrative in terms of the Russia probe from the get-go since the president  took office.  What can the president do to keep the team on focus on the  agenda?  </p><p>I mean, yesterday I had on a number of congressman and they blame the  senate for part of the obstructionist.  I mean we've got a healthcare bill  sitting in the senate, a lot of people want to see tax reform this year.   The president has been vocal about it, he wants a 15 percent corporate tax  rate, he's talked about his white paper that he's come out within that  regard but is there anything that the president can do to ensure that they  get something done, the congress passes legislation this year?  Because  Kellyanne, the truth is is, you could take one issue like the travel ban,  they're pushing back there.  You could take another issue like repealing  and replace ObamaCare, pushing back there.  But the real goal of the left  is to take over the house in 2018 and move to impeach President Trump.  How  does he get ahead of that?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well first of all, he has asked for their votes, we would still  love to have democratic votes on healthcare, on tax reform the way  President George W. Bush had 10 or 12 democratic senators in 2001 Maria to  pass his tax cut.</p><p>The democrats -- the senate was controlled by the democrats when President  George W. Bush passed his tax cut.  So we would love to have democratic  vote on infrastructure and any number of these measures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't look like (inaudible) </p><p>CONWAY:  And it doesn't look like they're even interested in governing.   The democrats are interested in politics, the president is interested in  governing and leading and having impact from people's lives.</p><p>So we're always open in getting their votes, where are they?  Why don't  they come to the table and channel some bipartisanship on measures that  affect their constituents as well?  Number two, the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the healthcare  reform.  You know, ObamaCare has been a (inaudible) for over seven years,  the sinking battleships turns slowly and they've got part one through the  House, now the senate will do its work, Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th that's around the corner.  Tax reform later  this year, they're moving towards infrastructure, towards border security,  more of that, the military's got new funding.</p><p>So things are happening and everywhere I go that's what people reflect back  to me, \"Tell the president we see what he's doing, to keep doing it, to not  give up, to knock it in.  We're praying for him, we support him, he's  making the impact on people's lives.\"  So I think the president just has to  have this two front in the one hand keeping an eye on these investigations  that he calls a witch hunt that so far have produced nothing but a waste of  taxpayer dollars --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's expensive.</p><p>CONWAY:  And it's getting really expensive.  We live through this before,  where are the same democrats who complained about previous investigations  that actually did bear fruit where a former president lied under oath and  obstructed justice.  We know what happened there.</p><p>They were -- they complained completely about the waste of taxpayer  dollars, I would up that end up to here.  And then, of course, the  president's main front is passing all this stuff, I work with him every  single day he and his senior team and his cabinet, his vice president  Maria, are forging ahead to create those jobs, to continue to have  confidence in the economy.  You see the small business manufacturing home  builder, consumer confidence numbers, you see the way the markets has  responded to this man's presidency.  He's been there five months tomorrow,  it's only five months.  People feel like things should be going faster and  faster because they know that's Donald Trump's pace.</p><p>But he's up against a Washington that moves much more slowly than he does  but I think the two shall meet.  And there's two paces and there's two ways  of doing business will actually produce -- continue to produce results for  real people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there's no doubt about it the president has been  incredibly successful in terms of rolling back regulations.  Whatever he  can do in terms of executive orders, without the congress, he's been able  to do and it's been very successful.</p><p>But he does face this goal on the left of just obstructing, stop the  agenda.  Chuck Schumer has been very clear.  They don't -- you're not going  to get democratic support.  I mean do you really think you're going to get  democratic support on tax reform or repeal and replace?  No.</p><p>CONWAY:  I feel like if people watch your show should call the democratic  senators and members of congress and say, \"Get on with it now.  Accept the  election results, stop with the resistance and move on to governing, move  on to leading.\"  </p><p>Because the democratic party is in an odd place right now, they had their  true leader, they're all arguing, they don't know what they're governing  philosophy is accepted, the message now is the message wasn't (inaudible)  Maria which is, \"You're terrible and I'm not you.\"  That's not a message,  that's an insult to anyone (inaudible).  But the democrats are stuck  somewhere between not being able to accept the 2016 election results and  being completely focused in the 2018 election results.</p><p>What about 2017?  What about governing?  What about leading?  What about --  you owe it to your constituents to get things done --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see -- yes.  We'll see if the public responds to the  obstructionism come '18.</p><p>CONWAY:  They were (inaudible) did you see the approval ratings?  Chuck  Schumer, the democrat, Pelosi their approval ratings are all much lower  than the president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.  All right.  Today, you've got a very  big meeting at the White House with technology CEOs.</p><p>CONWAY:  Yes, very exciting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The IT of government system is at focus, is that where the  priority is?  What's going to go on at the --  </p><p>CONWAY:  It is indeed.  And President Trump and Jared Kushner, his senior  adviser who runs the Office of American Innovation has been way on top of  this issue from day one.  </p><p>What is it?  We literally have government agencies and cabinets they can't  speak to each other because they have different programs.  And look at what  just happened recently in the last couple of weeks with the Veterans  Affairs Administration, you've got the Department of Defense and Veterans  Affairs literally weren't talking to each other.  So what Jared did is he  invited in the five brightest tech people or five tech experts in DoD, five  from Veterans Affairs and said, \"How can we get this together?\" </p><p>Viola, now we have a system in place where veterans will be treated as one  single patient seamlessly through both of those agencies.  So the idea is  to stop all this waste -- do you realize that LMB just finished with Y2K?   In 2017, do you realize that there are 1,000 different hotlines for  veterans to call the Veterans Affairs?  Do you realize that we spend -- the  average American spends like 30 hours a year on paperwork for the  government?  So we need a government agency that talks to each other and  make it seamless and modernize it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what the goal is today.</p><p>CONWAY:  And we're glad the tech CEOs are coming in to do that.  We know  that they have been incredibly successful, they do this for a living and  we're happy that they're coming to share their best practices with the  president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Kellyanne, good to see you.</p><p>CONWAY:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kellyanne Conway there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The death toll from last week's high-rise fire  in London is continuing to rise.  Cheryl Casone with the details now,  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes Maria, we're getting the numbers  unfortunately London police now says 79 people are now dead or missing  following that terrible fire at Grenfell Tower.  That's up from the last  update that we'd received a 58 dead or missing.</p><p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan says the fire was a preventable accident caused by  years of neglect from the government, their siding materials in that  building.  Local officials have come under heavy criticism for not  providing enough support or information.  So the cause of the fire was  (inaudible) 24 storey building does remain under investigation today but  there had been suggestions the new paneling used in a recent renovation may  have helped the flames move quickly at the outside of the building.  Again,  we're following the story for you out of London this morning.</p><p>We're also got (inaudible) at home Lockheed Martin in the final stages  negotiating a huge deal worth more than $37 billion.  The defense  contractor reportedly going to sell a record 440 F35 fighter jets serve  from 11 nations that does include the U.S.  The final price those jets  expected to be around $85 million.</p><p>And finally this is a way to make sure your child flies for free, give  birth onboard the aircraft.  A baby boy was born yesterday on an India Jet  Airways flight between Saudi Arabia to India.  The flight diverted to  Mumbai after a mom went into labor.  Luckily, a trained nurse was onboard,  and crew, and, of course, the passengers as well helped deliver that baby.   The airline has given the little boy Maria a free lifetime pass as a  birthday gift.  He flies for free for life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Thank you so much Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Brooks Koepka, how about that, swinging into the  history books this weekend with his first major championship.  The winner  of the U.S. Open, we've got all the highlights for a wild end for that  Open, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We have another first time winner of the major  championship in golf to report.  The U.S. Open wrapped up yesterday in  Wisconsin, we were happy to be there last week.  Jared Max with all the  highlights, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.  Seven straight major  won by a golfer who never won a major before.</p><p>27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka did in a record setting fashion.  All  tied up on the scoreboard with just six holes to go, Brian Harman now enter  Sunday lead to get minus 12 but fell apart with a couple of lay bogies on  12 and 13 as he was fall -- he would fall a couple of shots behind.  While  Brooks Koepka would to everything he needed to do.  Late in the tournament,  Koepka had birdies on 14, 15, and 16, eventually we would go to the 18th  hole and Brooks Koepka would manage to get in there for a birdie.  He  finishes at 16-under par, that ties Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest  score in relation to par at a U.S. Open.  Good for a check yesterday of  $2.16 million, that's the largest earning in one day in golf history,  congratulations to the 27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka.  </p><p>Last August, Kyle Larson earned his first career NASCAR victory at Michigan  International Speedway by beating out his friend Chase Elliot.  Yesterday,  Kyle Larson did it again.  In the target car, 15 laps to go at the  (inaudible) 400.  Larson would take advantage of a restart and claim the  lead from Kyle Bush and then with about 10 laps to go, you see Ryan  Blaney's care malfunctions, causes a pileup, Daniel Suarez gets clipped, he  runs in down (inaudible) into the wall.  Final laps though, Kyle Larson  scores his third career win and second of the season and celebrates with  his son on Father's Day.</p><p>All right.  So the Warriors lost the NBA title last year and then they  signed Kevin Durant and then they beat the Cavaliers for the championship  this year.  So now it's the Cavaliers turn to make a splash, right?  Well  according to Yahoo's Vertical, the Cavaliers received a phone call this  weekend from the Indiana Pacers who wanted to know if they might be  interested in making a trade for All Star Paul George who reportedly told  the team he will opt out of his contract in 2018 to become an unrestricted  free agent.  Paul George average nearly 24 points gain for the Pacers and  he is also friends with Lebron James back in April.  Lebron posted this on  Instagram saying, \"Nothing but love and respect.  Love the battle last  night bro.  I'm glad to see you back where you belong\" and includes this  hashtag #youngking because Lebron is king.  So maybe this is the beginning  of a recruiting process, Paul George, what a talented player, he's beaten a  bad injury, his back, so Cleveland would have to give up an arm and a leg  together.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was going to say, who are they  going to give up?</p><p>MAX:  Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love maybe.</p><p>BAKER:  You can't give up Kyrie.  No, no.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Paul George is no Kevin  Durant.  </p><p>MAX:  Correct.  Very few people are.  </p><p>BAKER:  Do you think Erin Hills is going to take -- that was the first  time they hosted the Open, are they going to take any heat for the  (inaudible)?</p><p>MAX:  Yes because the scores were way too strong.  We had more I  believe -- there were more scores under par yesterday than -- in this  tournament than we ever have in history as far as U.S. Open, so it wasn't  strong enough.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting if that's the case.  It was a long course,  they walked nine miles versus an average six miles on other course.</p><p>Let me ask you this, you got to explain this story to me, the Olympic  swimmer Michael Phelps has a new rival.  Phelps is going to face off  against El Great White Shark for a reality series on the Discovery Channel.   It's unclear how they're going to be raising against one another but it  will air during the Discovery Channel Shark Week, what do you make of this?</p><p>MAX:  Michael Phelps swims at best six miles per hour, a great white goes  twenty miles per hour.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what's the point?</p><p>MAX:  So I don't know how -- maybe -- somebody said maybe if Phelps gets a  head start, he starts first and then the shark coming after him maybe he  can get the seven miles an hour.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  (inaudible) the sharks chasing him, let's see how fast he  goes then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There will be some protective situation where he's in like a  tunnel of some sort.  I don't know, how are they going to do it.</p><p>MAX:  Maybe.  He's going to need a bigger boat.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Swim in a cage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to watch Discovery Channel for that one.   Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX:  Thanks Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared Max.

We got the full box  office recap coming your way.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, the President of Maslansky Partners, Lee Carter is here.  Rosecliff  Chief Executive Officer, Mike Murphy is here.  And Diligence President,  Mike Baker.  Good to see you everybody.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Really important conversation today, we're going to talk  about London, a fourth terrorist attack.  And in that meeting at the White  House Mike, I know you want to talk a lot about technology as well.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lot to get to this morning.  And coming up joining the  conversation this morning, the Adviser to President Trump, KellyAnne Conway  is joining us this morning.  So we're going to get into all of the above  with KellyAnne Conway when she joins us, coming up.</p><p>But first, terror strike in London again this morning.  British authority  say that the suspect has been detained as a van plowed into a crowd of  worshipers near a mosque in North London early this morning.  According to  London police, they are treating it as a possible act of terrorism.  One  man found dead at the scene though it is unclear if his death was related  to the attack.  At least 10 others were wounded.  The driver, a 48-year-old  man arrested at the scene after being detained by members of the public.   Video of the moment showed a Caucasian man being detained by police.   According to some reports, witnesses said that the driver was heard  shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.  Mike Baker, what do you make of this  attack?</p><p>BAKER:  Well I think the London authorities are right when they say, \"Look,  you got to condemn extremism no matter what it is.  This is not rocket  science.</p><p>A van drove in to a crowd of Muslims coming out of Mosque, it's Ramadan so  they're coming out, it's about a quarter twenty after midnight and so we  don't have to sit in angst and think too much about what this was all  about.  This is anger welling up from the recent attacks most likely that  had taken place in London whether the concert bombing or London in  Westminster Bridge attacks.  So --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess you look at the facts that it's four attacks in just  three months and try to put together the similarities as if it's ISIS  related but this doesn't seem to be that.</p><p>BAKER:  No, this is not.  Again, I don't -- I'm not one to sit and over  think something like this.  We just have to look at it, be pragmatic,  understand what it is and this is a response to what's been happening and  it's wrong and you can't -- what -- people always talk about sort of this  equivalency.  </p><p>\"Oh, if you talk like that or if you do drone campaigns then you lower  yourself to the level of the terrorist.\"  With the drones, I don't think  that's the case, I've never had a problem in operations in counterterrorism  differentiating myself from the bad guys.  But when something like this  happens, it does.  It's on the same level, you're attacking people coming  out their place of worship, you can't do it.</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean it's got to be a really scary time to live in London  because you have so many recent attacks and then there -- I'm sure there  are more people like this looking to respond to those attacks.</p><p>So you look back at all the people that they brought in to London and how  they let them branch off into little areas, pockets of their own  communities and it's got to be a really scary place to live right now.</p><p>BAKER:  Well it's a real divisiveness and you're absolutely right.  To  point out with this whole concept of multiculturalism that has developed  over decades now.</p><p>In the U.K. and now across the E.U. where the idea was, you don't  necessarily -- it was no effort to integrate within the society.  Celebrate  where you came from, celebrate your own culture.  Well that has created  this problem, this is a self inflicted wound to some degree and how they  resolve it, well in the immediate aftermath, they have to do what they're  doing which is Theresa May and all the other leaders have to come out,  condemn it, denounce, show transparency and a quick response just like they  would with any other attack.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But also push this idea that we will clamp down on any  extremism which they haven't done.  As you say, they're allowing people to  live in this no-go areas practice Sharia Law.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  The no-go thing is -- it's complicated, it's not quite the  narrative that has built up over a period of time now where somehow these  are (inaudible) police can't go in there, they go in there, they can go in  there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even in Paris?</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, even in Paris.  The problem is, it's not so much you have  access to go in there, the problem is developing communication.  And I know  this is going to sound touchy-feely at some 30,000 foot level but I'm  talking from an operational perspective.</p><p>You have to get into this communities, develop some level of trust in  communication in order so that when they see somebody, an immediate family  member, this is the only way you stop some of these folks is that the mom  or the cousin or the brother picks up the phone and has the ability to call  the local authorities.  So the no-go area is more of a tactical operation  which is no communication within these communities.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I do think this is a global issue though.  I mean we're  looking at London and what's happening right now in London.  Paris for a  while was the focus.</p><p>Here we've had -- even here in United States we've had so many issues.   This is global percolating -- percolation as a result I believe of ISIS --  as the result of this attack.  And so I think --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think is okay to do.</p><p>CARTER:  Well exactly.  When I think what -- this would have been an  opportunity for Theresa May I think to really regain confidence and she  hasn't really stepped up into that level.</p><p>And so I think it's really important right now that our world leaders step  up to the table and everybody says, \"Look, we're on the same page here,  let's stop with the blame game, let's just keep moving things forward and  let's start fresh.  There's so many opportunities right now on so many  things that we agree on, enough is enough let's move forward.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  Meanwhile, in Washington today, President  Trump meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White  House.  </p><p>This is the inaugural meeting of what they're calling \"The American  Technology Council.\"  Take a look at some of the leaders that are going to  be present there, the CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos will be there, as well as  Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, Tim Cook from Apple, IBM's Ginni Rommetty  just to name a few.  Mike Murphy, what do you make of this?  This is the  Trump Administration trying to update its IT they say.</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know how you can find a negative in this.  So Trump feels  like we need to serve the American people better with better technology so  he goes out and he gets the top people from the field of technology in the  world to advise him on it.  So I think -- and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What's wrong with that?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's the exact, right way to handle it and I think anybody  who doesn't show up or chooses not to show up is just showing a lack of  openness because you can debate.  </p><p>We can have different views on things but if I'm an expert in a certain  field and you're leading the country, you want to hear from me, you need to  hear from me.  So I think anybody who shows up there, it doesn't mean they  necessarily support President Trump, it means they support the United  States of America and I think it's a great thing that he's doing, I think  it's a great thing all of these people are doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to modernize the IT system of the U.S. is exactly what we  need by the way.  We're just looking at pictures of the president and the  first lady coming off of the plane from Camp David, the spent the weekend  in Camp David, Lee Carter.  He tweeted out that it was an honor to be there  as well.</p><p>CARTER:  I think that the American people are really glad to see him doing  these kinds of things.  I think they were -- there's a lot of criticism  spending time at his own property and I think people want to see President  Trump acting presidential doing a lot of the activities that they're used  to and I think there's something comforting about seeing him here.</p><p>I think it's also nice to see Barron in the picture too and enjoying  himself taking selfies being -- it's very, very human.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's being a kid.</p><p>CARTER:  Being a kid, yes.  </p><p>BAKER:  I wouldn't want to be a kid coming off of the Marine1.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I would have taken a selfie.  All right.  Let's talk  about the agenda for a second because senate republicans are working hard  to finalize their bill to replace ObamaCare.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he hopes to bring the bill  to the floor within the next two weeks.  Yesterday, I spoke with Senator  Marco Rubio he said the process will likely take a little longer.  Here's  what he told me on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) FLORIDA:  I think healthcare will happen this year,  tax reform we'll see.  We're working on that now, there's a component of it  that I'm working with Ivanka Trump on where there's the pro family  component of it and in fact we'll have a meeting this week with her and a  number of senators and house members to begin to layout that portion of the  agenda.</p><p>But I do think tax reform, these things can work simultaneously.  You don't  have to wait to finish on healthcare before you start formulating ideas on  tax reform and that's happening right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well I would expect the questions to really ramp up certainly  this week after what happened last week.  Steve Scalise is still on the  hospital obviously.  His condition was downgraded from a critical to  serious condition.  But do you worry about where the agenda stands now in  terms of tax reform and healthcare reform?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it seems like as if people after what happened last week,  people want to work together.  So hopefully, this was a bottom as far as  the divisiveness in Washington and now people can come together, put both  sides on the table and reach an agreement.</p><p>BAKER:  What I don't understand and maybe I'm just speaking this average  simpleton, when Marco Rubio says, \"You don't have to wait to start ideas on  tax reform\" why weren't the republicans doing this two years ago?  Why  didn't -- when they had this opportunity and they stepped in, they didn't  open the drawer, pull out their plan and say, \"Here it is, here's our tax  reform\" because that would have been the time to do this and not now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They repeal and replace.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.  I don't understand how Washington works, maybe that's as  simple as that.  I -- it's dysfunctional.</p><p>CARTER:  I think America does that's why Donald Trump is president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I will say this, there is a feeling the leadership says  continually that they are having meetings on tax reform right now just what  Marco Rubio just said that they are doing this behind the scenes in hopes  of getting this done this year.  Are you still a believer that they're  going to get something done?</p><p>CARTER:  I'm always an optimist and I hope they're going to get something  done.  I would love to see them say, \"We're going to work through the  summer break right now to get it done for the American people\" because  that's what they should do.  They made a promise, they should keep it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or they will do healthcare before July 4th which seems  incredible or maybe they get something out and then they do tax reform  after the summer, I don't know.  Two weeks.</p><p>CARTER:  It's just two weeks, yes.</p><p>BAKER:  They need the big legislative win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They do.</p><p>BAKER:  They have to have that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They really do.  We'll take a short break we've got a lot of  conversations on deck this morning.</p><p>Coming up in Colorado, some kids may go back to using a landline.  Why one  group is looking to ban the sale of cell phones for children under 13.</p><p>Then Brooks Koepka wins the U.S. Open, gaining his first ever major  championship victory.  We've got all the highlights from the big open, back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A navy jet has shot down a Syrian warplane.   Cheryl Casone with the details now, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Maria.  Well a U.S.  navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian government warplane after it attacks  Washington best fighters near Raqqa.</p><p>This is according to statement from U.S.-led coalition, the coalition said  in that statement that the shoot down was in accordance with rules of  engagement and a number of (inaudible) fighters were wounded in the attack.   Fox News is reporting the Super Hornet that shot down the jet was based  onboard the USS George H.W. Bush which is currently operating in the  Mediterranean Sea.  </p><p>Meanwhile here at home, Colorado is considering banning preteens from  owning cell phones.  Residents in favor, the campaign say that kids under  13 years of age spend too much time on their phone.  Under proposed law,  cell phone retailers will be required to ask the age of the primary cell  phone user before it's sold, parents would not be allowed to buy phones for  their kids that are under the age of 13.  Retailers would face a $500 fine  if they don't comply with this one.</p><p>And Cars 3 sped, get it, into the number one spot at the box office over  the weekend.  This is the 16th Pixar film to debut at number one.  They  brought in $53.5 million that beat the recording breaking Wonder Woman we  should say over the weekend but she is still a force to reckon with Maria,  that moving topping $570 million worldwide.</p><p>And a big in tournament, Brooks Koepka, the golfer coming out on top at the  U.S. Open this weekend.  He won his first major championship, he finished  16 under matching Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest rating score to par  at a U.S. open.  Koepka now the third American to win the U.S. Open in a  row following Dustin Johnson last year and during the (inaudible) in 2015.   Maria, I watch the show that looks like you had a great time at the U.S.  Open.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is beautiful.  We really did enjoyed.  It was great Cheryl.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the -- as U.S. authorities consider expanding a ban  for carryon laptops, airlines are faking the consequences.  How a broader  ban could affect you with the airport, coming up.</p><p>Then one American businessman, $5 billion away from overtaking Bill Gates  as the world's richest person, we'll tell you who it is next, back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos coming closer to  becoming the world's richest man after the company announced the Whole  Foodss deal on Friday, Amazon shares soared adding nearly $2 billion to  Bezos' net worth.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, one firm says that the bidding for  Whole Foodss may only be getting underway -- just beginning to get  underway.  Joining us right now is Kingsview Asset Management Chief  Investment Officer, Scott Martin.  Scott, good to see you.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Hey  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What an incredible deal.  When we first heard that deal on  Friday, what do you say?  My instinct was, they're taking over the world,  Amazon, I mean it's pretty incredible.  What were your thoughts?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I was shocked.  I mean Amazon now wants to control your  grocery aisle.  And you know what's interesting Maria too, I think there's  a couple of things going on with this deal, first of all, it's been rumored  and it came together at a very last minute.  </p><p>In fact, Amazon was only supposedly working on this deal for a matter of  weeks which maybe speaks to your point about this just begins the whole  negotiation process with respect to this deal but as far as the grocery  aisle goes, this isn't a great business.  If you look at the grocery in the  last several years, consumers are becoming more discerning, profit margins  are lowering at the grocers.  So what exactly Amazon's going to do to the  grocery aisle and do how you shop for your groceries is going to be  interesting with respect to the big reach they have now with Amazon Prime  and some of the other things they're doing at the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean look, people saw the deal, Mike Murphy, and they  thought, \"Wow, this is an incredible combination, they bid up the stocks  but the grocery business not such an easy business, that's number one.  And  number two is this may not be so easy to take it over, the journalist  reporting the Neuberger Berman might be a bidder, that there's a new  process that other bids will come in.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I can see anyone coming into bid against Bezos and Amazon.   They have --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And paying more than $13 billion.</p><p>MURPHY:  Because if you do bid it up, I think Bezos, he obviously wants the  company, he can go in and bid above them, it's going to be hard to compete.   I mean maybe a Walmart could go in and try to compete but I don't really  see that.</p><p>I think Whole Foodss is going to be acquired by Amazon and it's a low  margin business, it's not a great business to be in but I think Bezos is  thinking two or three steps ahead.  I think he's thinking about using all  the Whole Foods stores over 400 stores nationwide as fulfillment centers,  as processing centers, as warehouses.  I think he's seeing all the Whole  Foods customers, the affluent customers as Amazon members.  Remember,  Amazon stock popped on Friday on this news, it went up and increased more  market value than the entire purchase price that they're paying for Whole  Foods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p>MURPHY:  So I think right now the market's betting on Bezos and thinking  Bezos is going to figure this out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about all the other supermarket companies that all sold  off?  I mean everybody was worried it.  You look at Kroger, you look at the  other supermart companies and -- I mean what was that all about?  Do you  think people were just nervous?</p><p>MURPHY:  It was Kroger, it was Walmart, it was all of the supermarket  companies just thinking that Amazon is getting in here now, they're going  to do what they did in e-commerce.  They're going to just crush margins,  they can afford to lose money for a number of years.  So therefore they  could really put a ton of pressure on all the other grocers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MURPHY:  But I there's potential there because I think there'll be more  consolidation amongst the other place.</p><p>BAKER:  Well Whole Foods been having problems for some time now, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They needed help.</p><p>BAKER:  And I wonder to what degree this might be in part a strategic shot  at Walmart, you mentioned Walmart.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, big -- I mean it's a big part of it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  Yes.  And remember, an activist hedge funds came in and took  a big stake, almost a 10 percent stake in Whole Foods Jana Partners and  they were putting a lot of pressure on the board to do something, that  definitely had something to do with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey Scott, jump in here.  What about -- then there's the Yahoo  story as well, end of an era, officially becoming Altaba as it starts  trading under a new name, Yahoo becomes Altaba.  Do you think the company  will be able to turn around now that the Verizon deal is done?</p><p>MARTIN:  You know it's interesting Maria, when you look at Yahoo in the  last say six to twelve months and those shareholders that waited around for  this end of the Marissa Mayer deal even or the era of Marissa Mayer, that  actually got reward to shareholders because that's really one of the other  thing that I think the company is seeing moving forward but I'll tell you  what's interesting as far as Yahoo and ramping this back in the Amazon, i  mean Amazon is taking over the internet too.</p><p>I mean you look at Amazon web services, you look at all the reach that they  have now with their website and their apps, I mean a lot of these companies  that are trying to compete with Amazon whether it is in the grocery aisle,  whether it is online are really losing this battle and as I think what Mike  pointed out, Amazon is willing to go into these markets wherever it is and  lose money just to get consumers and customers just to be beat out the  competition.</p><p>CARTER:  I mean I also think though -- and I'm really curious to what you  think about this, is, is that there was some kind of a status symbol  associated with being able to afford to go to Whole Foods and what -- and I  think there's an opportunity for some of these brands to really step up and  sort of that niche that experience but they are going to have to adopt with  the time.  Do you think that there's any other brand that's going to be  able to comment and take that place?  I'm kind of wondering if the Whole  Foods brand is going to become water down now.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  Well I'm seriously worried about.  And that the curious  part, I mean I'm concerned about this deal from a standpoint of and Mike  brought it up.</p><p>If he turns these into the fulfillment centers and warehouses, then what  happens?  I mean -- because I agree the -- exactly.  The Whole Foods  experience is really good.  You know what happens Maria around in Chicago,  they just have a new one that's by my house, you go there, you shop, you  have a couple of beers in the bar, you maybe watch the game.  I mean that  maybe go away now and I think that's what's interesting about this deal for  Amazon that they're making for Whole Foods, do they want to take away that  experience because to me that's the value of the shopping experience at  Whole Foods.</p><p>BAKER:  Best line I heard over the weekend was Bezos to pay cash for Whole  Foods.  Who pays cash at Whole Foods?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.  That's the best joke ever.</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Best joke ever.  Go ahead Scott, you want to react?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I mean -- well you can't afford to pay cash at Whole Foods  that's why I'm a company man because if you don't have enough cash to go in  there that's why the plastic is so good.</p><p>And that's the other thing, Amazon Prime is one of the best let's say  gateway drugs in the planet with respect to what Amazon Prime does for  those who actually ends up going on Amazon and just buying more stuff  because they're Prime members.  It's similar demographic to who does shop  at Whole Foods, so there's some cross over there but how they change them  and how they manipulate that into really big sales is the question that I  have on my mind today but something that Bezos I think is going to answer  in the next couple of years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  Scott real quick, markets  are up today, you put new money to work or no?  Are you pulling back?</p><p>MARTIN:  No, I'm putting money to work Maria.  In fact, I love the tech  sector, they've beaten down the last couple of weeks because of investors  getting nervous.  That's been weak money, I think strong money is going to  come back in here towards the end of the quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  You agree with that Mike Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY:  I do completely.  It's opportunity here.  Market, there's a bit  under the markets goes higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tough first quarter for tech.  All right.  Scott, good to see  you sir.  Thank you. </p><p>MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, British Prime Minister Theresa May in the spotlight  this morning as formal negotiations for Brexit are underway.  How the  European Union is expected to respond as Britain moves to exit, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: Welcome  back!  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 19th, your top stories right now  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London is on edge, once again this morning.   At least one person has been killed and several others injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in north London; police are treating  this as a terrorist attack.  Meanwhile, Britain also focused on  negotiations for its exit from the European Union; those talks begin today  in Brussels.  We've got a lot at what's at stake.  The possibility of a  laptop ban as airlines scrambling, what it would mean for your trip to the  airport?  </p><p>And markets are rallying this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a  gain of 60 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average today at the open;  NASDAQ, strong by 35.  In Europe, markets are up across the board.  Take a  look at the indices in the Eurozone with the FTSE 100, up one-half of one  percent; and the CAC40 and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  In Asia,  overnight, mostly higher as you see across the board, actually; Nikkei  Average in Japan up two-thirds of a percent; Hang Seng Index and Hong Kong  up better one percent.  </p><p>And the Southwest facing blazing hot triple digit temperatures today,  that's not keeping tourist away though, in fact, they are flocking to Death  Valley.  We will tell you all about it.  Amazon and Wal-Mart on a collision  course for sure now, Wal-Mart announcing its own deal; what the competition  means for the company is coming up.  And the Vice President getting an  extra special Father's Day present; the Pence family welcome two new furry  members: a kitten and a puppy.  All of those stories coming up this  morning.  </p><p>First, our top stories this half an hour: Britain has been rocked by a  tragedy yet again.  London police are investigating a possible terrorist  attack outside of a mosque late last night.  Investigators say that a 40- year-old man rammed a van into a crowd injuring ten people, at least.  One  man was found dead at the scene; it is unclear, however, if that death is  related to this attack.  Prime Minister, Theresa May, is planning to hold  an emergency meeting on the case later today.  </p><p>Joining us right now: the Wall Street Journal U.K. and Brexit Editor,  Stephen Fidler.  Steven, good to have you, thanks so much for joining us.   I want to get to Britain exiting the E.U. in a moment, but first, this is  the fourth major attack in the U.K. since March; what is your reaction?  </p><p>STEPHEN FIDLER, WALL STREET JOURNAL AND BREXIT EDITOR:  Well, I think it's  certainly a surprise than worried people here.  And I think there's an  extra air of uncertainty, not only with these attacks but with the building  fire last Wednesday.  So, London, in particular, I think is feeling this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a feeling that things need to change in terms of  security?  I mean, how are people feeling in terms of why this is  happening, why London has been under such attack just in the last three  months or so?</p><p>FIDLER:  Well, I think the - I think there is a sense that things need to  change, and there is a question that obviously the security services have  in terms of what they're going to do to deal with people who appear radical  but don't necessarily appear set of violence, you know, what to do to stop  these people going into violence.  So, that's one thing; I think there'll  be a lot of community policing and these kinds of things.  So, I would say,  you know, London has noticed this, but I was down at Borough Market despite  those attacks on London Bridge a week or so ago on Friday, and the place  was just teeming with people.  I mean, it's a - you know, London isn't  shutting down in any sense.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  I'm curious what the political  environment is like there?  Here in the U.S., people say enough with the  partisanship.  It seems like the U.K. is having a very, very similar  experience right now.  And I'm just curious how people are looking at  Theresa May, and is she going to be able to lead us through this?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think you hit on something there.  I think there is a lot of  political uncertainty, particularly given what the election result was last  - a couple weeks ago.  In a sense that she expected to come with an  increased majority; we expected to have a stronger government, and in many  ways, we have a weaker one, she doesn't even have a majority in the House  Commons.  And it looks like she's kind of uncertain in handling a lot of  these things.  You know, she hasn't been very adept at adjusting to and  dealing with the crisis as they've come one after the other.  So, I think,  you know, there is the sense of the government is, you know, not reacting  to this very well, and that she, in particular, is struggling to cope with  all of the things on her plate, you know, including the Brexit negotiation  which is starting today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIVE:  Stephen, you  just something, I think is very important, you just referred to community  policing when you talk about how we try to get ahead of the curve here.  To  what degree do you think the Met Police, or MI-5, or others had had or  having success in developing some line of communication within the Muslim  communities here in the U.K?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think they've done that.  Obviously, they'll be looking at  what's happened and figure they haven't done it will enough, and it's one  of those things that's come into the political debate here which is whether  the cutbacks that have taken place in terms of government spending since  the financial crisis certainly have reduced the numbers of policemen and  reduced the numbers of police on the streets.  So, that sends at the  political debate with the Labour Party saying, you know, this is a  consequence of the conservative policies that there aren't as many police  on the street as they used to be in, and the community policing that used  to go on five years ago or so, isn't happening to the same degree now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to be watching that.  That's a really  important point to bring up.  Let me switch gears and ask you about talks  officially underway now for Britain to leave the European Union; what are  you expecting here, Stephen, in terms of David Davis-the Brexit Secretary- meeting with the E.U.'s Chief Negotiator in Brussels; that meeting  happening right now.  David said that you're determined to build a strong  partnership.  Listen to this; I want to get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, BREXIT SECRETARY:  There's more that unites us than divides  us.  So, while we were ghastly to be, challenging times ahead of us in the  negotiations, we will do all we can to assure that we deliver that works in  the best interest of all citizens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there are concerns that Prime Minister  Theresa May's government is too fragile when she the majority in the snap  election two weeks ago.  Their growing calls for her to drop her plan of  the hard exit out of the E.U.; what are your thoughts here?  How does this  play out?  </p><p>FIDLER:  Well, it's a - I think a when Theresa May called an election in  April, there was a feeling in Europe, in Brussel that, OK, we're going to  have a stronger leader in the U.K. that can deliver on the promises she  makes in the negotiations.  So, that hasn't happened.  So, I think on the  other side of the, you know, from European Union perspective, there is sort  of, you know, a lot questions about who they're dealing, and whether this  woman is going to be in charge six months from now, and whether they should  make concessions in negotiations with someone who might not be around for a  very long.  </p><p>And on the other hand, as you say, in the U.K., she less able to deliver on  the promises, you know, because the House of Commons is divided, as some of  their own party don't want the kind of hard  Brexit.  And you know, it's  possible that the House of Commons or the House of Lords, which is the  unelected second chamber could overturn a lot of what she's trying to do.   So, I think we're entering these negotiations only 21 months to go before  the U.K. leaves the E.U. in a very uncertain situation.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF VENTURES FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Stephen,  it's Mike Murphy, I would think of these recent attacks that's in the U.K.  that the people who are going to be voting would want to be more for  Brexit, so that they could kind of control their borders, and maybe be  safer as a group.  Do you see that gaining any momentum kind of the pro- Brexit crowd because of the recent attacks?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I don't see that as a - the opinion polls don't seem to show that.   I mean, there is an element of that in the discussions.  I mean, you know,  even in the European Union, the UK. could - you know, they're always  possible controls from other people coming in for the U.K.  So, it's not  quite true to say the U.K. didn't control these borders.  What it had an  issue with was people coming into, and working in the U.K. from other parts  of the European Union, and the U.K. could say, quote his answer.  So, I  think there's a slightly different questionnaire, and I think from the  other side of the coin is the state of the British economy.  I mean, the  pound fell very sharply after the referendum last year.  Inflation is  starting to feed through, and people are fighting their standard of living  being eroded.  So, maybe that the sorts of an anti-Brexit crowd are kind of  getting a little more growing, somewhat, because of concerns about the  economy.  </p><p>BAKER:  Stephen, Mike Baker here again, do you feel that comment of David  Davis is correct when he said that there's more that unites the U.K. with  U.E. and then divides you?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think there's a -- there's a sense in both - in which both sides  want a good deal out of this.  I don't think it's in any - nobody thinks  it's in their interest, but this all blows up and that's a sort of a big  break, or at least very few people think that's a - that's a great idea.   So, I think that's true.  I think that the thing that's left unsaid and  really that the U.K. hasn't held its answer is what actually do they  (INAUDIBLE) from this new relationship.  And certainly, some of the things  that they've outlined don't seem to be likely to be agreed on the other  side.  So, I think the - actually, the E.U. said much more about what it's  -- how it's going to approach the negotiations than the U.K. - than the  U.K. has.  There are a lot of unanswered questions about what the U.K.  really is looking for out of all of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen, then new developments in France, newly elected  President, Emanuel Macron consolidating power.  His party obviously winning  a clear majority in parliament overnight what does this victory mean for  the E.U.?</p><p>FIDLER:  It's interesting because it's contrast very much with what's going  on in the U.K., where you have - you have a leadership that is weakened.   Now, we've had this guy coming almost from nowhere in a year, creating a  political movement, becoming the President of France and gaining a huge  majority in the parliament to push through the kind of things that he said  he wants to do, which is including reforming the French slave market.  So,  I think the narrative in which the U.K. went into the sort of referendum  which was a declining European Union and sort of strengthening Britain.   That sort of - that kind of mood music has changed because I think the --  to some extent, anyway, and I wouldn't want to exaggerate this, the E.U.  has got its mojo back partly thanks to, what, some Macron who was a very  pro-E.U. candidate is doing, and also the fact that Angela Merkel looks as  if she's going to come back as chancellor, possibly with, you know,  increased majority or an increased size of her party.</p><p>So, in a sense, you know, it looks like the E.U. is sort of moving forward  to an extent that we didn't expect a year ago.  I mean, Macron's problem is  going to be not in the parliament now.  The question is going to be, what  happens in the streets?  How are they going to react?  The trade unions and  others, how are they going to react to what he's trying to do in the labor  market and to reform the economy?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's an important point, and that obviously becomes  clearer over the months and days to come.  Stephen, great to get your  insights.  Thanks so much.  Stephen Fidler joining us this morning in  London.</p><p>FIDLER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Boeing takes flight with a new plane.  How the  jetliner could rub up competition against rival, Airbus.  Stock has been on  fire of Boeing.  Then, Vice President Mike Pence ads some four-legged  friends to his family.  Their cute new pet social media debut, straight  ahead.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher this morning.  Take a  look at Futures indicating a pretty good rally at the opening of trading.   68 points higher on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  We're watching a  couple of names for you.  Boeing unveiled its first new jet in four years.   The company will develop a bigger 737.  Boeing says 10 customers have  already committed to buying that plane.  The announcement coming at the  Paris air show as the jetmaker looks to take on rising competition from  Airbus.</p><p>We are watching the banks this morning, including JPMorgan Chase.  The  Federal Reserve is set to release the latest result of the stress test  beginning Thursday this week.  Investors are hoping that the banks will get  approval to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends.  And U.S.  Airlines gearing up for the possibility of an expanded ban of carryon  laptops.  Cheryl Casone on that detail right now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria, we were thinking  that we might get news like this.  So, that initial ban that was put into  effect in May by the U.S. and the U.K. did affect some flights from the  Middle East and North Africa.  A ban now under consideration by the Trump  administration would involve flights originating for as many as 71 airports  around the world.  Big expansion.  That would mean additional security  checks and most likely a lot of angry international customers.  </p><p>Well, we're watching an extreme heat wave happening right now as out in the  southwest, parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah all really  suffering.  Temperatures expected to climb well above 110 degrees this week  in several parts of that region.  Death Valley, that's the hottest place in  America could see, get this, 124 degrees tomorrow.  And we are told that  some tourists actually finding to go there to experience Death Valley in  124 degrees.  No, not a smart idea.  </p><p>All right.  Another headlines this morning.  Good God.  Wal-Mart is going  shopping for an online retailer.  The company - this actually went down on  Friday, Maria, is buying Bonobos, they sell men's clothing for $310 million  in cash.  Now, this deal coming as Wal-Mart takes on Amazon for the future  of retail, and of course, it's on the same date that Amazon announced the  big deal, of course, to buy whole foods.  Wal-Mart has been moving  aggressively to try and transform himself into a major e-commerce power.   They bought jet.com last year for more than $3 billion (AUDIO GAP) today as  you could see on your chart under pressure, though, this morning.</p><p>And then, Vice President Mike Pence celebrated Father's Day by adding two  new members to the family.  The Pences welcomed a new kitten and dog into  their home.  The V.P.'s daughter, Charlotte, posted pictures of the new  addition, Charlie and Hazel.  They replaced the Pence's beagle, Maverick,  who died shortly before for the election.  And then (INAUDIBLE) of a cat,  Oreo, who passed away earlier this month.  They joined Pickles, another  family cat, by the way.  And they also have a bunny, Maria, named Marilyn  Van Dough.  They love (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Marilyn, Hazel, Pickles.  I love it.  I love it. </p><p>CARTER:  I always trust people who - I always trust people who love animals  more than those that's -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me, too.  That's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are on this story, ladies and gentlemen.  For all  new Mike Pence pet news, you (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of pets.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  fighting crime and making a return on your investment at the same time.   Why superhero comic books are trending at the auction block.  We'll tell  you about it, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  May 2017 was a win for comic books with $48.2  million worth of merchandise ordered.  This after comic book sales had a  20-year sales record last August who was (INAUDIBLE) by the success of both  the Marvel and D.C. Film Universes.  Joining me right now is  ComicConnect.com COO, Vincent Zurzolo.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much  for being here.</p><p>VINCENT ZURZOLO, COMICCONNECT.COM CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your auction of nearly 18,000 comics just closed last  night.  How did it go?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  We had a record week last week.  Closed from Monday through  Friday last week, and preauction estimated were $4 to $5 million.  We broke  $7 million on the auction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  We can make the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think is behind this obsession with comic books  that we have.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Well, I think people are very nostalgic and they're trying to  recapture the happiest times of their life, their childhood.  But I also  think it has a lot to do with the - that comic books have become  commodities.  They are all encapsulated in hard plastic holders from CGC  grading company which is the world's largest grading company.  And they are  encapsulated in these comic book holders, and it makes people who don't  know how to grade a comic book makes them able to buy and sell comic books.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because actually we're looking - I  was thinking, yes, there is that, that we want to relive our childhood, and  I'm thinking, \"Well, that's really wholesome, right?\"  But some comics are  not wholesome.  I've seen a lot of comics.  My husband likes comic books.   And some of these comic books get serious.  I mean, it's not so wholesome.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Well, they're not all for little kids.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Exactly.  Like my husband.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  You know, so there are - there you go.  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what is the attraction, do you think?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  So, I think it's nostalgia, I think it's this idea that you -  it's a form of entertainment, it's escapism, it's a form of investing.   People are not so in love with - I think nowadays ever since the recession,  traditional forms of investment.  They have to have - become their own type  of investor.  So, they look at things they love, tangible assets like  vintage comic books.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And one of them that you brought in was the comic in which  Superman appears for the second time.  Let's look at that one here.  How  much does that one go for at all?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  This comic book, the second cover appearance of Superman went for  $188,000.  What's important about this is, this is the court case copy.   This was used when D.C. Comics sued Fox who had made an intimation Superman  back in the 40s, 30s and 40s.  And -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's show that one.  That's this one right here.  Yes.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Because if you the stamp, the court case stamp.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is the court case stamp.  Wow.  Because they made a  Superman -</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes, Wonderman who was kind of a rip off from Superman.  But this  is the comic book that sold for the most in our auction is the first  appearance of Superman in action comics number one.  Now, my company holds  records, world record.  We sold the first million-dollar comic book, 1.5,  2.2, and over 3 million.  This copy is conserved.  It has a little bit of  conservation done to it to maintain the structural integrity.  This comic  book, we estimated to sell for about $200 to $250,000, sold for $393,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  What -- now what does a collector do with that?   Just keep it covered and it's just - that's the price.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  I think it's in their safe or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $300,000 for a comic?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  $393,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Almost 400 grand for this cover.  Batman, a  significant character in D.C. Comics.  Why did that one bring in such a  large amount of money?  Tell us about the Batman.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  So, Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman.  This  comic book is actually restored.  If it wasn't restored, it would sell for  over a million dollars easy.  This comic we estimated to sell for about 200  to 250.  It sold for $313,000.  People love Batman, they love Superman.   These are two of the biggest characters in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  But what about characters today?  Are there new  characters that have emerged today that perhaps could command these kinds  of numbers? </p><p>ZURZOLO:  You know, there's a comic book that came out.  You might have  heard of it, The Walking Dead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Well, it's a huge T.V. show.  Walking dead is huge.  That's  comic book in perfect condition.  The number one copy can sell for over  $3,000, which is really exciting.  Our company will be bringing the world's  best collection of Walking Dead to auction later this year to coincide with  New York Comic-Con as well as an original art collection that's going to  blow the minds of many people around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how do you choose something like that, Walking Dead.  Why  did you think Walking Dead would be a good thing?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  I never did.  You know, it's not my market.  But I started  reading them and a comic book done in black and white that was done so  effectively.  It was just amazing.  When you read the original comic book,  you understand why it's become a worldwide phenomenon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating.  Vincent, great to have you.  Thanks so much for  walking us through it.  </p><p>ZURZOLO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Vincent Zurzolo there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  Congressman Steve Scalise's condition has improved.  He is upgraded from  critical to serious, just coming after he was shoot last week during  baseball practice with other Republican lawmakers.  The details next hour.   MORNINGS WITH MARIA back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p>In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p>BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p>BAKER:  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p>They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p>A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p>Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p>And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p>So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p>And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p>Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p>Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p>And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p>BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p>BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p>I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p>CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p>MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p>KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p>BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p>KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p>KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p>KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p>Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.  What we know about the attacker this morning.   Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.  </p><p>Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues.  The  Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire  Whole Foods.  The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning!  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p>And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.  Brooks Koepka,  making a name for himself at U.S. Open.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Koepka, a major champion </p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The impact on one of his main sponsors; we'll take a look at  the shares of Nike coming up.  Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p>WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p>PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p>But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p>PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na[ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p>MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p>BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p>PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p>We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p>MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p>BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p>And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p>CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p>CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday June 19.</p><p>Here are your top stories 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning: London on edge again.  At least one person has  been killed, several others injured after a man plowed his van into a crowd  near a mosque in northern London.  British Prime Minister Theresa May  addressing the attack moments ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  This morning, our country woke to  news of another terrorist attack on the streets of our capital city; the  second this month and every bit as sickening as those which have come  before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to London straight ahead to get the  latest there.</p><p>Meanwhile, YouTube taking steps to combat extremism.  Details on the  company's new policies coming up.</p><p>Technology executives are descending on the White House today.  Top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's IT system for a  meeting at the White House with the President.  Among the CEOs attending:  Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, IBM CEO Ginny Rometty among  others.</p><p>Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading today -- take a look.

Nasdaq up almost 40 points right now --  that's two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>In Europe, gains across the board as well to report.  The FT 100 in London  up two-thirds of a percent.  The CAC 40 in Paris up almost 1 percent.  The  DAX index as well.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets close higher also.  The Hang Seng in Hong Kong  best performer -- up better than 1 percent.</p><p>And Brooks Koepka makes a name for himself at the U.S. Open. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Koepka -- our major champion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he became the third straight American to win the U.S.  Open.  We've got all the highlights.</p><p>What's old is new again apparently.  Atari makes a comeback with a new  console.  This is the first new console in 20 years.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it: the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter is here; the CEO of  Rosecliff Mike Murphy is here; and the president of Diligence Mike Baker is  here.  Great to see you.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot on deck today.</p><p>BAKER:  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Sure is.  Some great guests, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got important guests coming up to talk about what's  going on in London.  We're going to take you live to London momentarily.</p><p>The story out of the White House this morning in terms of technology and  Mike these markets are looking firmer.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Firm, new highs and I think there is a bit  underneath the market.  A lot of negatives out there but the market, as  they say, finds a wall of worry and that's what we're getting right now --  earnings supporting higher prices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning: the counselor to  President Trump Kellyanne Conway is here -- don't miss that.  She's coming  up this hour.</p><p>First though new questions surrounding whether President Trump is actually  under investigation or not by the special counsel looking into Russia's  alleged election meddling.</p><p>On Friday the President tweeted this.  \"I'm being investigated for firing  the FBI director by the man who told me to fired the FBI director.  Witch  hunt.\"</p><p>But yesterday a member of the President's legal team contradicted that  tweet.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, MEMBER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM:  The President has not  been notified by anyone that he is under investigation.  That tweet, Chris  was in response to the \"Washington Post\" story that alleged that five  unnamed sources, anonymous sources linked to the \"Washington Post\" that the  President was in fact under investigation.  So that tweet was in response  to that.  </p><p>There has been no notification of any investigation.  Nothing has changed  since James Comey said the President was not a target or a subject of  investigation.  Nothing's changed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst right now,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- good to see.  Good morning.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on all of this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I think it's a little bit in the weeds because if you  have the former FBI director making a case for attempted obstruction of  justice or even bribery against the President of the United States and  making it in a fairly forceful way.  Whatever you think of him as an FBI  director, that is certainly enough to trigger an investigation.</p><p>So I think both sides are right.  I think that the President is being  investigated but he is not a target.  A target means they plan to bring  charges against you.  So when Jay Sekulow says he hasn't gotten a target  letter that it's probably technically true but it doesn't mean that he's  not been investigated.</p><p>State differently the FBI must investigate allegations of the nature and  quality that James Comey alleged in that senate testimony that he gave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I don't know why the President feels the need to respond  to something like a \"Washington Post\" report.  He calls them fake news  anyway.  So why respond?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he has had tremendous success in energizing  his base -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  I know.  I get that.  I get that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- with his tweets.  No human being in the modern era has had  the success that he has in communicating with his supporters and bypassing  the media.</p><p>But this is a dangerous area for him because we now see federal judges  taking literally Sean Spicer's statement.  The President's tweets official  government communications and federal judges using statements made in the  tweets to undermine oral arguments that his Justice Department is making in  court.</p><p>So he at times while undermining the base may be working at cross purposes  with what his Justice Department is trying to persuade federal judges.</p><p>BAKER:  This may not be a fair question, Judge but what is your gut  feeling?  Where is this going?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know.  I wish I did.  I don't know where it's going  but I do believe that -- as I just said to all of you -- the allegations  that James Comey made were said with such credibility and confidence that  they can't be ignored and they will investigated.</p><p>Now, here is a good side of this.  Sometimes the FBI in the early stages  before you are a subject down here, before you're a target up here you are  sort of in the mix.  They may want to exclude certain people from becoming  subjects and targets and in order to do that they have to conduct an  investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I think we should start looking at where the real  obstructionism has been in that where we know it was.  Senate Republicans  are now turning their attention and their investigative eyes to former  attorney general Loretta Lynch.  Some are saying that they want her to  testify after alarming accusations by the former director, Jim Comey, in  his recent congressional testimony.</p><p>Here is one thing he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  At one point the Attorney General had  directed me not to call it an \"investigation\" but instead to call it a  \"matter\" which confused me and concerned me.  But that was one of the  bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the  department if we are going to close this case credible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was one of three things people are talking about in  terms of why Loretta Lynch needs to be investigated.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Number one, the matter versus investigation.  Number two, the  tarmac meeting -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- two days before Hillary Clinton was to testify, she met with  her husband President Clinton on the plane.</p><p>And number three, apparently there is a memo floating around that has not  been widely disseminated but basically says -- suggests that Loretta Lynch  I will be getting involved.  I'll make sure the FBI investigation of  Clinton doesn't go too far.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Now, we don't know if this memo exists.  But the reports on  the memo are the recipient of it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- the then chair of the Democratic National Committee.  Now  this was back before the DNC, when Bernie Sanders' candidacy was still  alive and Mrs. Clinton had not yet been exonerated by Jim Comey.  Just as I  said that Comey painted enough of a serious case against the President to  warrant investigation by the special prosecutor.</p><p>He clearly painted enough of a case against Loretta Lynch to be  investigated by not the senate judiciary committee but the same FBI, the  regular FBI, the Justice Department -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and not the special prosecutor.</p><p>Now, it is odd and has only happened in rare instances that an attorney  general investigates his predecessor.  It happened, of course when John  Mitchell, Richard Nixon's Attorney General was prosecuted and convicted and  went to jail.  </p><p>But I am telling you there are enough allegations stated in a credible way,  supported by other forensic evidence like we saw pictures of her with Bill  Clinton -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- to warrant a criminal investigation of Mrs. Lynch for  misconduct in office.  Did she use the Justice Department as a political  instrument to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not to mention all of the spying that went on and the  unmasking.  Then there's that.  I am just throwing this out there because  there is a fair amount of things out there to investigate -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- at this point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  but remember, this is not Bob Mueller.  This is Jeff Sessions  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and whoever is running.  It is still Andrew McCabe because  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- Christopher Wray has not yet been confirmed.  It is the  regular DOJ that should be investigating her.</p><p>BAKER:  What I worry and this is what happens in Washington it seems like  all the time which is all these various issues now get molded together, the  public becomes utterly confused over where we're going with this.  And  eventually it all goes away and dies.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now it gives the impression of either scandal or  instability, neither of which is good to give that impression coming from  the Justice Department which is supposed to be relatively neutral -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- doing the right thing, enforcing the rule of law devoid of  politics and above the fray.  It doesn't seem to be that way right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I brought up the memo because there is also  speculation that is totally fake -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- I mean does it exist or not.  We don't know.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  We do know that the \"matter\" thing is true because -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The \"matter\" is true.  He testified under oath.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You'll get a peek at this because Mike -- you live in this  environment.  FBI agents were poking the director in the ribs saying,  you're now the director of the federal bureau of matters.  It's a criminal  investigation -- where is this \"matter\" nonsense coming from? </p><p>BAKER:  We've got to change the logo.  It's going to cost money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. Let's talk about a case that has really rocked  Hollywood and that is, of course, Bill Cosby; a shocking outcome to the  Bill Cosby sexual assault trial yesterday.  The judge declared a mistrial  after the jury was deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberation.</p><p>Judge -- what does this mean for the case against the comedian?  Walk us  through what a mistrial looks like.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  A judge must determine that no further deliberation time is  likely to change anybody's opinion.  Now we don't know if it's 11 to 1 or 6  to 6 or some combination.  Obviously you need unanimity for a conviction  and unanimity for acquittal.  And they didn't have unanimity.</p><p>Some judges will just ask the jury foreman, can you tell me Madam Foreman,  whether or not in your opinion any further deliberation will help.  Some  judges -- this is what I used to do were asked each individual juror.   Don't tell me how you're voting.  That's none of my business.  I want to  know if you still have an open mind or if you are steadfast and nothing  else will change that opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And once the judge comes to that conclusion well then it's  simply a waste of time.  The prosecutors have announced that they will  retry him probably in the fall or the winter.</p><p>This is a very, very strange case because he received a promise, Bill  Cosby, from a prosecutor don't worry you're not going to be prosecuted you  can give a deposition into what happened.  He gave the deposition, the  prosecutor died.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The new prosecutor can -- the judge said, the promise is only  good for as long as he's the prosecutor.  So they can use your own words  against you.  That's called a built-in appeal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is extraordinary.  That's incredible.  </p><p>Judge -- thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great insights as always from you.  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>The U.K. authorities are now investigating that van attack near the London  mosque early this morning as a possible terrorist attack.  </p><p>Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is on the ground in  London right now with the very latest.  Benjamin -- good morning to you.</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you  from London.  Well, yet another attack hitting London over here but, of  course, what it so s strikingly different in this case is that this was an  attack on Muslims.  Of course, we have seen vehicles being used time and  time again.  But not like this.</p><p>And as you said, this is now being treated as an act of terrorism and  investigated by the counter terrorism unit.  It happened just after  midnight here in Finchley, north London outside a Muslim center.  At a time  when the neighborhood was crowded with Muslims finishing Ramadan prayers.   It seems that the attacker knew when prayers ended and he was waiting.</p><p>Muslim leaders have now called it a hate crime and they've asked the public  to stay calm and try to avoid divisions within the community.</p><p>Police have arrested the driver.  He's a 48-year-old white man.    He was  grappled to the ground by two bystanders until the police could arrive.   Those two men are being called heroes.</p><p>Eyewitnesses have also reported that he said a number of times \"I've done  my bit\" and \"I want to kill Muslims.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He did what he did deliberately to hit and kill as many  Muslims as possible.  So he is a terrorist.  So at this stage we are  calling for calm.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HALL:  And the video has also emerged showing the attacker apparently  blowing a kiss from the police van that he was been taken away.  He's been  taken to the hospital.  He's going to be charged when he is let out of  there.</p><p>But a lot of people are saying this is exactly what ISIS wanted.   (inaudible) the narrative.  It helps to create even greater divisions.  And  so right here where we are now in London very much on edge.  It's a very  multi-ethnic, very diverse neighborhood and the police really are just  trying to keep it safe, keep it under control.  The Prime Minister coming  out as well and saying this was not only an attack on this community.  It  was an attack on the whole of the country.  Back to you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Benjamin -- thank you.  Benjamin Hall will get back  to you as news develops there.</p><p>Coming up -- Google cracks down on terrorism -- how technology giant says  it is combating the spread of extremism on YouTube.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The acting secretary of the Navy has promised a  full investigation into a collision between the destroyer a container ship  off of the coast of Japan.  It killed seven sailors.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the story now -- Cheryl</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria -- of course the story  developing over the weekend.  That collision happened early Saturday  morning as many of the crew slept.  Secretary Sean Stackley praised the  crewmembers for saving the USS Fitzgerald from further damage and bringing  it back into part.  And of course, the sad story is they find those  sailors.</p><p>Representative Steve Scalise's condition, we should say, has now been  upgraded to serious from critical.  According to Medstar Washington  Hospital Center, the congressman had more surgery over the weekend but he  does continue to show signs of improvement.  </p><p>And Scalise did not let his health crisis get in the way of father's day.   He said on the father's day message on twitter, saying quote, \"Steve's  greatest joy is being a father to Madison and Harrison and a husband to  Jennifer.  This father for the Scalise family and they send their best  wishes to every family especially the dads.  Take the time to be close to  the ones that you love.</p><p>Of course Scalise, one of five people wounded last week when a gunman  opened fire on Republicans at a baseball practice in suburban, Virginia.</p><p>Well, tomorrow's special election in Georgia.  It's too close to call.  And  the two candidates are scrambling for last-minute votes.  The race between  Republican Karen Handle and Democratic Jon Ossoff is seen as a key test for  Republican swing voters, uneasy with President Trump's policies.  </p><p>And Atari is back in the hardware business.  The company says it's making a  video game console for the first time in more than 20 years.  It's called  the Atari box, Some of the world's most iconic video games ran of course,  on Atari including Pong, Pac-Man.  Atari filed for bankruptcy in 2013.   They emerged here later as the company focused on mobile and online games  but the company says that Atari box is based on PC technology.  As a kid  always playing Atari -- bring it on back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bring back Pac-Man.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm ready for that.</p><p>BAKER:  I put a lot of quarters into the Pong machine -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How cool we are?</p><p>MURPHY:  It's fantastic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pong, Pac-Man.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  I bought my three little boys Scooter, Slughorn (ph) and  Mugsie (ph).  I bought them an old Atari and they love this thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BAKER:  And I was worried.  I thought they're going to look at it and go,  \"are you kidding me\".  They loved it.</p><p>MURPHY:  They take the Atari over the iPhone?</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not your kids.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not your kids.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your kids are not taking Atari over the iPhone.</p><p>MURPHY:  They need the iPhone 7.  The 6 isn't even good enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.  All right.  We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, Google takes new measures to combat the rise of  terrorism online.  The technology giant's new plan to crack down on  extremist contents on YouTube.  We've got it.</p><p>Then Lockheed soars ahead of the massive fighter jet deal.  The aircraft  maker agreeing to sell $37 billion worth of F-35s to nearly a dozen  countries.  Take a look at how investors are reacting to the news.</p><p>Boeing stock also on fire.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>YouTube ramps up efforts to restrict the amount of extremist content on the  site.  </p><p>Tracee Carrasco has the details now.  Tracee -- good morning to you.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>Now the parent company of Google says it is working to remove all videos  that violate YouTube's community guidelines such as those promoting  terrorism.  YouTube will increase technology and the number of experts to  flag terrorist-related content and videos that do not meet grounds for  removal but still promote offensive viewpoints will come with a warning and  will not be able to be recommended, endorsed or commented on by users  making them harder to find.  </p><p>YouTube will also use targeted online advertising to reach potential ISIS  recruits and then redirect them towards anti-terrorism videos that can  change their minds about joining.  A spokesperson for Google says quote,  \"There should be no place for terrorist content on our services.\"</p><p>The changes come after reports that one of the suspects in the London  Bridge terror attack became radicalized after watching pro-ISIS videos on  YouTube.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have faced harsh criticism for not  doing enough to remove extremist content from their Web sites.  </p><p>It is a daunting task with, you know, over 400 videos uploaded per minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For a long time these companies, YouTube included, were getting  criticized for not doing enough.  Do you see this as enough.</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  I don't but I don't know what the answer is.  I think  somehow someway extremists are going to figure out a way to get their  message out there.</p><p>I don't know if these companies can actually do enough to stop it, if they  can do anything to stop it because I think the terrorists will get around  it someway.</p><p>BAKER:  This is an advantage.  This is actually a good move.  I agree, it's  not going to solve the problem entirely.  But it is in combination with a  variety of other things including locating, identifying and taking them  out.  This sort of step is also very helpful.</p><p>CARTER:  But I can't help but wonder, I mean with all the big data  advancements and they know who the target audiences are that are on their  sights, what they're interested in so they can serve up advertisement.  How  can they not know what else is going on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's a good point you make because they've got  all these measurement tools -- </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to track everything else.  How come they can't track this  better?</p><p>CARTER:  When they could give me an advertisement on what I want why can't  they say, do you want something bad.</p><p>BAKER:  They could.  They could.  But you know what that means.  That means  changing laws.</p><p>MURPHY:  Censorship. </p><p>BAKER:  That's right.  And if they -- </p><p>MURPHY:  You're giving up something for getting something.  I'm not saying  we don't.  I think we should be more aggressive.  But that is a bigger  conversation.</p><p>CARTER:  But giving up a privacy to be told to.  I mean why not for  security.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's all important issues to bring up.</p><p>Tracee -- thank you.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p>Coming up -- Pushing ahead with President Trump's agenda.  We'll talk to  the White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway about that agenda.  What the  administration is doing to cut through the noise, get to work on health  care and tax reform.</p><p>Plus has the Discovery Channel finally jumped (ph) a shark?

The first  meeting of the Technology Advisory Council convenes late this afternoon  focusing on the government's IT system; among those attending Apple's CEO  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Amazon's Jeff Bezos among others.</p><p>While all of this is happening at the White House Congress is focused on  the agenda.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that he wants  healthcare done by the Fourth of July.  Senator Marco Rubio says speed  should not be the priority.  Here's what he told me yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I would rather us do it right than do it  fast because no matter what passes, if it isn't good or it has some  unintended consequence the President is going to be held responsible for  that.  Republicans are going to be held responsible for that.  Let's not  repeat the mistakes the Democrats made.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a closer look at the legislative agenda coming up.</p><p>Markets are rallying today, kicking off the week strongly -- Dow  Industrials at the highs of the morning right now up to 75 points.

Ten others were  wounded, the driver, a 48-year-old man arrested at the scene after being  detained by members of the public.  According to some reports witnesses  said that the driver was heard shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.</p><p>Joining me right now is Counsel to the president, Kellyanne Conway.   Kellyanne, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, U.S. PRESIDENT:  It's a pleasure Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  We've got extra security  measures being taken, people are worried.  Do you expect we'll see extra  security measures taken in the U.S. as a result of what went on in London?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well the president and his counterterrorism team assess this  situation throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were  concerned with their British counterparts and since it looks like the  British government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll  wait to see how that investigation unfolds.</p><p>And where we support our allies anyway that they need, we just don't want  this to become the new normal where people feel like they're changing the  behavior, their lifestyles, their lives indeed Maria and allowing the  terrorists in any form to win and to prevail.  And so we know that people  are very concerned about national security, it's in large part how the  president won.  He just frankly put out the more masculine, more robust  antiterrorism program whether it's (inaudible) strength or him wanting ISIS  to be in retreat.  Hillary Clinton referred to them as our, \"determined  enemies\" at her convention speech so I think there's a huge contrast.  And  you're seeing that play out now where the president is constantly talking  about how his first response really to this nation is our safety and  security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he really did.  And I think that's why it's just a head  scratch as far as why he gets this pushback on the travel ban and  everything else.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are new questions surrounding whether or not the president  is actually under investigation or not by the Special Counsel looking into  Russia's alleged election meddling.  On Friday the president tweeted out  this, \"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who  told me to fire the FBI Director!  Witch Hunt.\"  And then yesterday, a  member of the president's legal team contradicted the tweet.  Kellyanne, is  the president under investigation?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well I don't think Jay Sekulow, the president (inaudible)  contradicting the tweet, I think he explained it.  What Mr. Sekulow said is  that is that the president is constrained by the 140 characters in Twitter.</p><p>The president uses his social media platform to communicate directly with  the people as you know Maria.  But that Jay Sekulow, his per -- one of his  personal lawyers said the president has not been notified that he's under  investigation.  In fact, Mr. Comey testified that the president is not the  president said in the letter where he dismissed Mr. Comey in May, that  Comey had told him three times that he wasn't under investigation, they've  not been notified otherwise.  His personal lawyer would know this.</p><p>And it's important to say that because what the president was reacting to  in that particular social media message was the Washington Post report that  was based on five anonymous seekers, anonymous sources that must have been  leaked that he's somehow under investigation.  His lawyer is saying no he's  not.  So I think he's explaining that the president is really pointing out  the irony of everything and the last part of his tweet is the most  important which is that he consider this to be a witch hunt.</p><p>We've been doing this for many, many months now having an investigation,  where's the collusion?  Where's the obstruction of justice?  Where's the  evidence that supports this conclusion and we have separate, what, five or  six different separate congressional investigations going on and we've been  doing this for eight to nine months, I mean you could have a baby in this  time and they have no evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, I have been very adamant about this as well from the  beginning saying, look, this is a -- it looks like a completely  manufactured story.  Russia has been hacking, it has been undermining the  U.S. and the West for decades, why attach the president to that he has  nothing to do with it?</p><p>However, why respond to the Washington Post do you think Kellyanne?  I mean  the president has rightly so called some of the news out there fake news  and in many cases the president was right, why respond to the Washington  Post?  I mean the idea of tweeting, I understand he's speaking directly to  the American people, people like it and it's been a good strategy for him.   But can you convince him or ask him why he's not tweeting about the agenda?   Why he's not tweeting about other -- why bring up the Russia story and  respond to the Washington Post when this is a news organization he's called  fake news anyway.</p><p>CONWAY:  So here's where everybody has to wake up each morning and make  their own choices.  The media could cover all of his tweets and if they did  that, they would see that he more often tweets about agenda items than  other matters.  </p><p>He has this constant stream on Instagram, on Facebook, on Twitter, his big  social media platform where he says reaches about 100 million people,  Maria.  And you had the entire day in Cuba the other day where he rolled  back these awful rules that Obama put in place that allowed the Cuban  Regime not the Cuban people to benefit financially.  We had the first  meeting at the White House with the Opioid Commission on Friday.  Earlier  in the week the president did workforce development and apprenticeship  week, that's all on Twitter.</p><p>This week he'll be meeting with the -- today he'll be meeting with the tech  CEOs.  Last week he also sign some things into laws and the EOs that  benefit people, benefit workers.  All of that goes on to his Twitter feed  when he has a bilateral.  He's hosted I think more than 20 now with the  White House with foreign leaders but people don't want to cover that, they  want to cover -- they're very selective in the different tweets they want  to cover.  So he -- I'm telling you, the American people see all of the  social media platforms.  They're sort of saying attention saying, \"Wow,  he's going to put all this money and all this force in effect of the White  House behind apprenticeship programs where those who go through at  apprenticeship program the Department of Labor say they get -- they're 90  percent get employed immediately and they make an average of $60,000 per  year.</p><p>So we want to dignify all types of career paths, all types of jobs, the  welders, the hairdressers, the plumbers, the carpenters, people who get a  high school diploma and a skill certificate.  All of that's on the social  media platform, they just don't want to cover it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I think that's a fair point.  I mean, but there is  criticism that the president brings up things that he doesn't really need  to.  I mean does he create some obstacles for himself by bringing up some  of the things that perhaps the supporters don't believe anyway?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well in this case though he -- first of all, he's the president of  all Americans and he made that clear beginning on November 9th and he's  never wavered from that.  </p><p>People who criticize him and even deny that the legitimacy of his  presidency will benefit from his tax cut, they will benefit from better  healthcare, they will be benefit from infrastructure, they will benefit  from ISIS in retreat, they will benefit from the regulatory framework being  chipped away because it's impeding our pocketbook in a personal liberty  issues.  But Maria, the fact that the president feels he has a right to  defend himself on occasion.</p><p>He's watching a one-sided witch hunt as he refers to it because it's not  like if we're in a court of law and you're watching people -- you're  watching one side and it's a prosecution rest and here comes the defense,  it doesn't work that way.  You got Comey testifying without anybody  responding in front of 20 million people.  You've got outlet after outlet  that's still criticizing him that is against him, that's part of the  \"resistance and obstruction.\"  You got an entire democratic party and their  presidential nominee (inaudible)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about what the president could do but let  me get to this because the president has added John Dowd, a veteran lawyer  in Washington to his legal team.  Is the president preparing for a legal  battle?  Is that why he is upping the number of people on the legal team?   Tell us what he's expecting.</p><p>CONWAY:  Well he's always been a prepared man.  He's a very smart  businessman, among the smartest, most successful.  </p><p>And he's just somebody who surrounds himself with the best and the  brightest and he's doing that here as well.  What he's preparing for is  what we already know exist which is this investigation that's ongoing --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The witch hunt is what he calls it.</p><p>CONWAY:  Witch hunt.  But it continues forward for now and he's just  preparing himself for that.  And I know a number of these attorneys and  they're all very talented and they all have different types of expertise.</p><p>And I think the most important thing is that they understand their client  in this case and that they protect him and they avail him of every possible  resource in him defending himself, he has the right to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I think the left has been really driving this  narrative in terms of the Russia probe from the get-go since the president  took office.  What can the president do to keep the team on focus on the  agenda?  </p><p>I mean, yesterday I had on a number of congressman and they blame the  senate for part of the obstructionist.  I mean we've got a healthcare bill  sitting in the senate, a lot of people want to see tax reform this year.   The president has been vocal about it, he wants a 15 percent corporate tax  rate, he's talked about his white paper that he's come out within that  regard but is there anything that the president can do to ensure that they  get something done, the congress passes legislation this year?  Because  Kellyanne, the truth is is, you could take one issue like the travel ban,  they're pushing back there.  You could take another issue like repealing  and replace ObamaCare, pushing back there.  But the real goal of the left  is to take over the house in 2018 and move to impeach President Trump.  How  does he get ahead of that?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well first of all, he has asked for their votes, we would still  love to have democratic votes on healthcare, on tax reform the way  President George W. Bush had 10 or 12 democratic senators in 2001 Maria to  pass his tax cut.</p><p>The democrats -- the senate was controlled by the democrats when President  George W. Bush passed his tax cut.  So we would love to have democratic  vote on infrastructure and any number of these measures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't look like (inaudible) </p><p>CONWAY:  And it doesn't look like they're even interested in governing.   The democrats are interested in politics, the president is interested in  governing and leading and having impact from people's lives.</p><p>So we're always open in getting their votes, where are they?  Why don't  they come to the table and channel some bipartisanship on measures that  affect their constituents as well?  Number two, the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the healthcare  reform.  You know, ObamaCare has been a (inaudible) for over seven years,  the sinking battleships turns slowly and they've got part one through the  House, now the senate will do its work, Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th that's around the corner.  Tax reform later  this year, they're moving towards infrastructure, towards border security,  more of that, the military's got new funding.</p><p>So things are happening and everywhere I go that's what people reflect back  to me, \"Tell the president we see what he's doing, to keep doing it, to not  give up, to knock it in.  We're praying for him, we support him, he's  making the impact on people's lives.\"  So I think the president just has to  have this two front in the one hand keeping an eye on these investigations  that he calls a witch hunt that so far have produced nothing but a waste of  taxpayer dollars --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's expensive.</p><p>CONWAY:  And it's getting really expensive.  We live through this before,  where are the same democrats who complained about previous investigations  that actually did bear fruit where a former president lied under oath and  obstructed justice.  We know what happened there.</p><p>They were -- they complained completely about the waste of taxpayer  dollars, I would up that end up to here.  And then, of course, the  president's main front is passing all this stuff, I work with him every  single day he and his senior team and his cabinet, his vice president  Maria, are forging ahead to create those jobs, to continue to have  confidence in the economy.  You see the small business manufacturing home  builder, consumer confidence numbers, you see the way the markets has  responded to this man's presidency.  He's been there five months tomorrow,  it's only five months.  People feel like things should be going faster and  faster because they know that's Donald Trump's pace.</p><p>But he's up against a Washington that moves much more slowly than he does  but I think the two shall meet.  And there's two paces and there's two ways  of doing business will actually produce -- continue to produce results for  real people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there's no doubt about it the president has been  incredibly successful in terms of rolling back regulations.  Whatever he  can do in terms of executive orders, without the congress, he's been able  to do and it's been very successful.</p><p>But he does face this goal on the left of just obstructing, stop the  agenda.  Chuck Schumer has been very clear.  They don't -- you're not going  to get democratic support.  I mean do you really think you're going to get  democratic support on tax reform or repeal and replace?  No.</p><p>CONWAY:  I feel like if people watch your show should call the democratic  senators and members of congress and say, \"Get on with it now.  Accept the  election results, stop with the resistance and move on to governing, move  on to leading.\"  </p><p>Because the democratic party is in an odd place right now, they had their  true leader, they're all arguing, they don't know what they're governing  philosophy is accepted, the message now is the message wasn't (inaudible)  Maria which is, \"You're terrible and I'm not you.\"  That's not a message,  that's an insult to anyone (inaudible).  But the democrats are stuck  somewhere between not being able to accept the 2016 election results and  being completely focused in the 2018 election results.</p><p>What about 2017?  What about governing?  What about leading?  What about --  you owe it to your constituents to get things done --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see -- yes.  We'll see if the public responds to the  obstructionism come '18.</p><p>CONWAY:  They were (inaudible) did you see the approval ratings?  Chuck  Schumer, the democrat, Pelosi their approval ratings are all much lower  than the president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.  All right.  Today, you've got a very  big meeting at the White House with technology CEOs.</p><p>CONWAY:  Yes, very exciting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The IT of government system is at focus, is that where the  priority is?  What's going to go on at the --  </p><p>CONWAY:  It is indeed.  And President Trump and Jared Kushner, his senior  adviser who runs the Office of American Innovation has been way on top of  this issue from day one.  </p><p>What is it?  We literally have government agencies and cabinets they can't  speak to each other because they have different programs.  And look at what  just happened recently in the last couple of weeks with the Veterans  Affairs Administration, you've got the Department of Defense and Veterans  Affairs literally weren't talking to each other.  So what Jared did is he  invited in the five brightest tech people or five tech experts in DoD, five  from Veterans Affairs and said, \"How can we get this together?\" </p><p>Viola, now we have a system in place where veterans will be treated as one  single patient seamlessly through both of those agencies.  So the idea is  to stop all this waste -- do you realize that LMB just finished with Y2K?   In 2017, do you realize that there are 1,000 different hotlines for  veterans to call the Veterans Affairs?  Do you realize that we spend -- the  average American spends like 30 hours a year on paperwork for the  government?  So we need a government agency that talks to each other and  make it seamless and modernize it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what the goal is today.</p><p>CONWAY:  And we're glad the tech CEOs are coming in to do that.  We know  that they have been incredibly successful, they do this for a living and  we're happy that they're coming to share their best practices with the  president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Kellyanne, good to see you.</p><p>CONWAY:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kellyanne Conway there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The death toll from last week's high-rise fire  in London is continuing to rise.  Cheryl Casone with the details now,  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes Maria, we're getting the numbers  unfortunately London police now says 79 people are now dead or missing  following that terrible fire at Grenfell Tower.  That's up from the last  update that we'd received a 58 dead or missing.</p><p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan says the fire was a preventable accident caused by  years of neglect from the government, their siding materials in that  building.  Local officials have come under heavy criticism for not  providing enough support or information.  So the cause of the fire was  (inaudible) 24 storey building does remain under investigation today but  there had been suggestions the new paneling used in a recent renovation may  have helped the flames move quickly at the outside of the building.  Again,  we're following the story for you out of London this morning.</p><p>We're also got (inaudible) at home Lockheed Martin in the final stages  negotiating a huge deal worth more than $37 billion.  The defense  contractor reportedly going to sell a record 440 F35 fighter jets serve  from 11 nations that does include the U.S.  The final price those jets  expected to be around $85 million.</p><p>And finally this is a way to make sure your child flies for free, give  birth onboard the aircraft.  A baby boy was born yesterday on an India Jet  Airways flight between Saudi Arabia to India.  The flight diverted to  Mumbai after a mom went into labor.  Luckily, a trained nurse was onboard,  and crew, and, of course, the passengers as well helped deliver that baby.   The airline has given the little boy Maria a free lifetime pass as a  birthday gift.  He flies for free for life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Thank you so much Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Brooks Koepka, how about that, swinging into the  history books this weekend with his first major championship.  The winner  of the U.S. Open, we've got all the highlights for a wild end for that  Open, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We have another first time winner of the major  championship in golf to report.  The U.S. Open wrapped up yesterday in  Wisconsin, we were happy to be there last week.  Jared Max with all the  highlights, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.  Seven straight major  won by a golfer who never won a major before.</p><p>27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka did in a record setting fashion.  All  tied up on the scoreboard with just six holes to go, Brian Harman now enter  Sunday lead to get minus 12 but fell apart with a couple of lay bogies on  12 and 13 as he was fall -- he would fall a couple of shots behind.  While  Brooks Koepka would to everything he needed to do.  Late in the tournament,  Koepka had birdies on 14, 15, and 16, eventually we would go to the 18th  hole and Brooks Koepka would manage to get in there for a birdie.  He  finishes at 16-under par, that ties Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest  score in relation to par at a U.S. Open.  Good for a check yesterday of  $2.16 million, that's the largest earning in one day in golf history,  congratulations to the 27-year-old American, Brooks Koepka.  </p><p>Last August, Kyle Larson earned his first career NASCAR victory at Michigan  International Speedway by beating out his friend Chase Elliot.  Yesterday,  Kyle Larson did it again.  In the target car, 15 laps to go at the  (inaudible) 400.  Larson would take advantage of a restart and claim the  lead from Kyle Bush and then with about 10 laps to go, you see Ryan  Blaney's care malfunctions, causes a pileup, Daniel Suarez gets clipped, he  runs in down (inaudible) into the wall.  Final laps though, Kyle Larson  scores his third career win and second of the season and celebrates with  his son on Father's Day.</p><p>All right.  So the Warriors lost the NBA title last year and then they  signed Kevin Durant and then they beat the Cavaliers for the championship  this year.  So now it's the Cavaliers turn to make a splash, right?  Well  according to Yahoo's Vertical, the Cavaliers received a phone call this  weekend from the Indiana Pacers who wanted to know if they might be  interested in making a trade for All Star Paul George who reportedly told  the team he will opt out of his contract in 2018 to become an unrestricted  free agent.  Paul George average nearly 24 points gain for the Pacers and  he is also friends with Lebron James back in April.  Lebron posted this on  Instagram saying, \"Nothing but love and respect.  Love the battle last  night bro.  I'm glad to see you back where you belong\" and includes this  hashtag #youngking because Lebron is king.  So maybe this is the beginning  of a recruiting process, Paul George, what a talented player, he's beaten a  bad injury, his back, so Cleveland would have to give up an arm and a leg  together.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was going to say, who are they  going to give up?</p><p>MAX:  Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love maybe.</p><p>BAKER:  You can't give up Kyrie.  No, no.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Paul George is no Kevin  Durant.  </p><p>MAX:  Correct.  Very few people are.  </p><p>BAKER:  Do you think Erin Hills is going to take -- that was the first  time they hosted the Open, are they going to take any heat for the  (inaudible)?</p><p>MAX:  Yes because the scores were way too strong.  We had more I  believe -- there were more scores under par yesterday than -- in this  tournament than we ever have in history as far as U.S. Open, so it wasn't  strong enough.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting if that's the case.  It was a long course,  they walked nine miles versus an average six miles on other course.</p><p>Let me ask you this, you got to explain this story to me, the Olympic  swimmer Michael Phelps has a new rival.  Phelps is going to face off  against El Great White Shark for a reality series on the Discovery Channel.   It's unclear how they're going to be raising against one another but it  will air during the Discovery Channel Shark Week, what do you make of this?</p><p>MAX:  Michael Phelps swims at best six miles per hour, a great white goes  twenty miles per hour.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what's the point?</p><p>MAX:  So I don't know how -- maybe -- somebody said maybe if Phelps gets a  head start, he starts first and then the shark coming after him maybe he  can get the seven miles an hour.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  (inaudible) the sharks chasing him, let's see how fast he  goes then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There will be some protective situation where he's in like a  tunnel of some sort.  I don't know, how are they going to do it.</p><p>MAX:  Maybe.  He's going to need a bigger boat.</p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  Swim in a cage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to watch Discovery Channel for that one.   Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX:  Thanks Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared Max.

At least 10 others were wounded.  The driver, a 48-year-old  man arrested at the scene after being detained by members of the public.   Video of the moment showed a Caucasian man being detained by police.   According to some reports, witnesses said that the driver was heard  shouting he wanted to kill Muslims.  Mike Baker, what do you make of this  attack?</p><p>BAKER:  Well I think the London authorities are right when they say, \"Look,  you got to condemn extremism no matter what it is.  This is not rocket  science.</p><p>A van drove in to a crowd of Muslims coming out of Mosque, it's Ramadan so  they're coming out, it's about a quarter twenty after midnight and so we  don't have to sit in angst and think too much about what this was all  about.  This is anger welling up from the recent attacks most likely that  had taken place in London whether the concert bombing or London in  Westminster Bridge attacks.  So --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess you look at the facts that it's four attacks in just  three months and try to put together the similarities as if it's ISIS  related but this doesn't seem to be that.</p><p>BAKER:  No, this is not.  Again, I don't -- I'm not one to sit and over  think something like this.  We just have to look at it, be pragmatic,  understand what it is and this is a response to what's been happening and  it's wrong and you can't -- what -- people always talk about sort of this  equivalency.  </p><p>\"Oh, if you talk like that or if you do drone campaigns then you lower  yourself to the level of the terrorist.\"  With the drones, I don't think  that's the case, I've never had a problem in operations in counterterrorism  differentiating myself from the bad guys.  But when something like this  happens, it does.  It's on the same level, you're attacking people coming  out their place of worship, you can't do it.</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean it's got to be a really scary time to live in London  because you have so many recent attacks and then there -- I'm sure there  are more people like this looking to respond to those attacks.</p><p>So you look back at all the people that they brought in to London and how  they let them branch off into little areas, pockets of their own  communities and it's got to be a really scary place to live right now.</p><p>BAKER:  Well it's a real divisiveness and you're absolutely right.  To  point out with this whole concept of multiculturalism that has developed  over decades now.</p><p>In the U.K. and now across the E.U. where the idea was, you don't  necessarily -- it was no effort to integrate within the society.  Celebrate  where you came from, celebrate your own culture.  Well that has created  this problem, this is a self inflicted wound to some degree and how they  resolve it, well in the immediate aftermath, they have to do what they're  doing which is Theresa May and all the other leaders have to come out,  condemn it, denounce, show transparency and a quick response just like they  would with any other attack.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But also push this idea that we will clamp down on any  extremism which they haven't done.  As you say, they're allowing people to  live in this no-go areas practice Sharia Law.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  The no-go thing is -- it's complicated, it's not quite the  narrative that has built up over a period of time now where somehow these  are (inaudible) police can't go in there, they go in there, they can go in  there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even in Paris?</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, even in Paris.  The problem is, it's not so much you have  access to go in there, the problem is developing communication.  And I know  this is going to sound touchy-feely at some 30,000 foot level but I'm  talking from an operational perspective.</p><p>You have to get into this communities, develop some level of trust in  communication in order so that when they see somebody, an immediate family  member, this is the only way you stop some of these folks is that the mom  or the cousin or the brother picks up the phone and has the ability to call  the local authorities.  So the no-go area is more of a tactical operation  which is no communication within these communities.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I do think this is a global issue though.  I mean we're  looking at London and what's happening right now in London.  Paris for a  while was the focus.</p><p>Here we've had -- even here in United States we've had so many issues.   This is global percolating -- percolation as a result I believe of ISIS --  as the result of this attack.  And so I think --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think is okay to do.</p><p>CARTER:  Well exactly.  When I think what -- this would have been an  opportunity for Theresa May I think to really regain confidence and she  hasn't really stepped up into that level.</p><p>And so I think it's really important right now that our world leaders step  up to the table and everybody says, \"Look, we're on the same page here,  let's stop with the blame game, let's just keep moving things forward and  let's start fresh.  There's so many opportunities right now on so many  things that we agree on, enough is enough let's move forward.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  Meanwhile, in Washington today, President  Trump meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White  House.  </p><p>This is the inaugural meeting of what they're calling \"The American  Technology Council.\"  Take a look at some of the leaders that are going to  be present there, the CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos will be there, as well as  Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, Tim Cook from Apple, IBM's Ginni Rommetty  just to name a few.  Mike Murphy, what do you make of this?  This is the  Trump Administration trying to update its IT they say.</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know how you can find a negative in this.  So Trump feels  like we need to serve the American people better with better technology so  he goes out and he gets the top people from the field of technology in the  world to advise him on it.  So I think -- and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What's wrong with that?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's the exact, right way to handle it and I think anybody  who doesn't show up or chooses not to show up is just showing a lack of  openness because you can debate.  </p><p>We can have different views on things but if I'm an expert in a certain  field and you're leading the country, you want to hear from me, you need to  hear from me.  So I think anybody who shows up there, it doesn't mean they  necessarily support President Trump, it means they support the United  States of America and I think it's a great thing that he's doing, I think  it's a great thing all of these people are doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to modernize the IT system of the U.S. is exactly what we  need by the way.  We're just looking at pictures of the president and the  first lady coming off of the plane from Camp David, the spent the weekend  in Camp David, Lee Carter.  He tweeted out that it was an honor to be there  as well.</p><p>CARTER:  I think that the American people are really glad to see him doing  these kinds of things.  I think they were -- there's a lot of criticism  spending time at his own property and I think people want to see President  Trump acting presidential doing a lot of the activities that they're used  to and I think there's something comforting about seeing him here.</p><p>I think it's also nice to see Barron in the picture too and enjoying  himself taking selfies being -- it's very, very human.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's being a kid.</p><p>CARTER:  Being a kid, yes.  </p><p>BAKER:  I wouldn't want to be a kid coming off of the Marine1.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I would have taken a selfie.  All right.  Let's talk  about the agenda for a second because senate republicans are working hard  to finalize their bill to replace ObamaCare.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he hopes to bring the bill  to the floor within the next two weeks.  Yesterday, I spoke with Senator  Marco Rubio he said the process will likely take a little longer.  Here's  what he told me on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) FLORIDA:  I think healthcare will happen this year,  tax reform we'll see.  We're working on that now, there's a component of it  that I'm working with Ivanka Trump on where there's the pro family  component of it and in fact we'll have a meeting this week with her and a  number of senators and house members to begin to layout that portion of the  agenda.</p><p>But I do think tax reform, these things can work simultaneously.  You don't  have to wait to finish on healthcare before you start formulating ideas on  tax reform and that's happening right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well I would expect the questions to really ramp up certainly  this week after what happened last week.  Steve Scalise is still on the  hospital obviously.  His condition was downgraded from a critical to  serious condition.  But do you worry about where the agenda stands now in  terms of tax reform and healthcare reform?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it seems like as if people after what happened last week,  people want to work together.  So hopefully, this was a bottom as far as  the divisiveness in Washington and now people can come together, put both  sides on the table and reach an agreement.</p><p>BAKER:  What I don't understand and maybe I'm just speaking this average  simpleton, when Marco Rubio says, \"You don't have to wait to start ideas on  tax reform\" why weren't the republicans doing this two years ago?  Why  didn't -- when they had this opportunity and they stepped in, they didn't  open the drawer, pull out their plan and say, \"Here it is, here's our tax  reform\" because that would have been the time to do this and not now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They repeal and replace.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.  I don't understand how Washington works, maybe that's as  simple as that.  I -- it's dysfunctional.</p><p>CARTER:  I think America does that's why Donald Trump is president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I will say this, there is a feeling the leadership says  continually that they are having meetings on tax reform right now just what  Marco Rubio just said that they are doing this behind the scenes in hopes  of getting this done this year.  Are you still a believer that they're  going to get something done?</p><p>CARTER:  I'm always an optimist and I hope they're going to get something  done.  I would love to see them say, \"We're going to work through the  summer break right now to get it done for the American people\" because  that's what they should do.  They made a promise, they should keep it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or they will do healthcare before July 4th which seems  incredible or maybe they get something out and then they do tax reform  after the summer, I don't know.  Two weeks.</p><p>CARTER:  It's just two weeks, yes.</p><p>BAKER:  They need the big legislative win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They do.</p><p>BAKER:  They have to have that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They really do.  We'll take a short break we've got a lot of  conversations on deck this morning.</p><p>Coming up in Colorado, some kids may go back to using a landline.  Why one  group is looking to ban the sale of cell phones for children under 13.</p><p>Then Brooks Koepka wins the U.S. Open, gaining his first ever major  championship victory.  We've got all the highlights from the big open, back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A navy jet has shot down a Syrian warplane.   Cheryl Casone with the details now, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Maria.  Well a U.S.  navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian government warplane after it attacks  Washington best fighters near Raqqa.</p><p>This is according to statement from U.S.-led coalition, the coalition said  in that statement that the shoot down was in accordance with rules of  engagement and a number of (inaudible) fighters were wounded in the attack.   Fox News is reporting the Super Hornet that shot down the jet was based  onboard the USS George H.W. Bush which is currently operating in the  Mediterranean Sea.  </p><p>Meanwhile here at home, Colorado is considering banning preteens from  owning cell phones.  Residents in favor, the campaign say that kids under  13 years of age spend too much time on their phone.  Under proposed law,  cell phone retailers will be required to ask the age of the primary cell  phone user before it's sold, parents would not be allowed to buy phones for  their kids that are under the age of 13.  Retailers would face a $500 fine  if they don't comply with this one.</p><p>And Cars 3 sped, get it, into the number one spot at the box office over  the weekend.  This is the 16th Pixar film to debut at number one.  They  brought in $53.5 million that beat the recording breaking Wonder Woman we  should say over the weekend but she is still a force to reckon with Maria,  that moving topping $570 million worldwide.</p><p>And a big in tournament, Brooks Koepka, the golfer coming out on top at the  U.S. Open this weekend.  He won his first major championship, he finished  16 under matching Rory Mcllroy's record for the lowest rating score to par  at a U.S. open.  Koepka now the third American to win the U.S. Open in a  row following Dustin Johnson last year and during the (inaudible) in 2015.   Maria, I watch the show that looks like you had a great time at the U.S.  Open.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is beautiful.  We really did enjoyed.  It was great Cheryl.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the -- as U.S. authorities consider expanding a ban  for carryon laptops, airlines are faking the consequences.  How a broader  ban could affect you with the airport, coming up.</p><p>Then one American businessman, $5 billion away from overtaking Bill Gates  as the world's richest person, we'll tell you who it is next, back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos coming closer to  becoming the world's richest man after the company announced the Whole  Foodss deal on Friday, Amazon shares soared adding nearly $2 billion to  Bezos' net worth.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, one firm says that the bidding for  Whole Foodss may only be getting underway -- just beginning to get  underway.  Joining us right now is Kingsview Asset Management Chief  Investment Officer, Scott Martin.  Scott, good to see you.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Hey  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What an incredible deal.  When we first heard that deal on  Friday, what do you say?  My instinct was, they're taking over the world,  Amazon, I mean it's pretty incredible.  What were your thoughts?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I was shocked.  I mean Amazon now wants to control your  grocery aisle.  And you know what's interesting Maria too, I think there's  a couple of things going on with this deal, first of all, it's been rumored  and it came together at a very last minute.  </p><p>In fact, Amazon was only supposedly working on this deal for a matter of  weeks which maybe speaks to your point about this just begins the whole  negotiation process with respect to this deal but as far as the grocery  aisle goes, this isn't a great business.  If you look at the grocery in the  last several years, consumers are becoming more discerning, profit margins  are lowering at the grocers.  So what exactly Amazon's going to do to the  grocery aisle and do how you shop for your groceries is going to be  interesting with respect to the big reach they have now with Amazon Prime  and some of the other things they're doing at the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean look, people saw the deal, Mike Murphy, and they  thought, \"Wow, this is an incredible combination, they bid up the stocks  but the grocery business not such an easy business, that's number one.  And  number two is this may not be so easy to take it over, the journalist  reporting the Neuberger Berman might be a bidder, that there's a new  process that other bids will come in.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I can see anyone coming into bid against Bezos and Amazon.   They have --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And paying more than $13 billion.</p><p>MURPHY:  Because if you do bid it up, I think Bezos, he obviously wants the  company, he can go in and bid above them, it's going to be hard to compete.   I mean maybe a Walmart could go in and try to compete but I don't really  see that.</p><p>I think Whole Foodss is going to be acquired by Amazon and it's a low  margin business, it's not a great business to be in but I think Bezos is  thinking two or three steps ahead.  I think he's thinking about using all  the Whole Foods stores over 400 stores nationwide as fulfillment centers,  as processing centers, as warehouses.  I think he's seeing all the Whole  Foods customers, the affluent customers as Amazon members.  Remember,  Amazon stock popped on Friday on this news, it went up and increased more  market value than the entire purchase price that they're paying for Whole  Foods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p>MURPHY:  So I think right now the market's betting on Bezos and thinking  Bezos is going to figure this out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about all the other supermarket companies that all sold  off?  I mean everybody was worried it.  You look at Kroger, you look at the  other supermart companies and -- I mean what was that all about?  Do you  think people were just nervous?</p><p>MURPHY:  It was Kroger, it was Walmart, it was all of the supermarket  companies just thinking that Amazon is getting in here now, they're going  to do what they did in e-commerce.  They're going to just crush margins,  they can afford to lose money for a number of years.  So therefore they  could really put a ton of pressure on all the other grocers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MURPHY:  But I there's potential there because I think there'll be more  consolidation amongst the other place.</p><p>BAKER:  Well Whole Foods been having problems for some time now, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They needed help.</p><p>BAKER:  And I wonder to what degree this might be in part a strategic shot  at Walmart, you mentioned Walmart.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, big -- I mean it's a big part of it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  Yes.  And remember, an activist hedge funds came in and took  a big stake, almost a 10 percent stake in Whole Foods Jana Partners and  they were putting a lot of pressure on the board to do something, that  definitely had something to do with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey Scott, jump in here.  What about -- then there's the Yahoo  story as well, end of an era, officially becoming Altaba as it starts  trading under a new name, Yahoo becomes Altaba.  Do you think the company  will be able to turn around now that the Verizon deal is done?</p><p>MARTIN:  You know it's interesting Maria, when you look at Yahoo in the  last say six to twelve months and those shareholders that waited around for  this end of the Marissa Mayer deal even or the era of Marissa Mayer, that  actually got reward to shareholders because that's really one of the other  thing that I think the company is seeing moving forward but I'll tell you  what's interesting as far as Yahoo and ramping this back in the Amazon, i  mean Amazon is taking over the internet too.</p><p>I mean you look at Amazon web services, you look at all the reach that they  have now with their website and their apps, I mean a lot of these companies  that are trying to compete with Amazon whether it is in the grocery aisle,  whether it is online are really losing this battle and as I think what Mike  pointed out, Amazon is willing to go into these markets wherever it is and  lose money just to get consumers and customers just to be beat out the  competition.</p><p>CARTER:  I mean I also think though -- and I'm really curious to what you  think about this, is, is that there was some kind of a status symbol  associated with being able to afford to go to Whole Foods and what -- and I  think there's an opportunity for some of these brands to really step up and  sort of that niche that experience but they are going to have to adopt with  the time.  Do you think that there's any other brand that's going to be  able to comment and take that place?  I'm kind of wondering if the Whole  Foods brand is going to become water down now.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  Well I'm seriously worried about.  And that the curious  part, I mean I'm concerned about this deal from a standpoint of and Mike  brought it up.</p><p>If he turns these into the fulfillment centers and warehouses, then what  happens?  I mean -- because I agree the -- exactly.  The Whole Foods  experience is really good.  You know what happens Maria around in Chicago,  they just have a new one that's by my house, you go there, you shop, you  have a couple of beers in the bar, you maybe watch the game.  I mean that  maybe go away now and I think that's what's interesting about this deal for  Amazon that they're making for Whole Foods, do they want to take away that  experience because to me that's the value of the shopping experience at  Whole Foods.</p><p>BAKER:  Best line I heard over the weekend was Bezos to pay cash for Whole  Foods.  Who pays cash at Whole Foods?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.  That's the best joke ever.</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Best joke ever.  Go ahead Scott, you want to react?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I mean -- well you can't afford to pay cash at Whole Foods  that's why I'm a company man because if you don't have enough cash to go in  there that's why the plastic is so good.</p><p>And that's the other thing, Amazon Prime is one of the best let's say  gateway drugs in the planet with respect to what Amazon Prime does for  those who actually ends up going on Amazon and just buying more stuff  because they're Prime members.  It's similar demographic to who does shop  at Whole Foods, so there's some cross over there but how they change them  and how they manipulate that into really big sales is the question that I  have on my mind today but something that Bezos I think is going to answer  in the next couple of years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  Scott real quick, markets  are up today, you put new money to work or no?  Are you pulling back?</p><p>MARTIN:  No, I'm putting money to work Maria.  In fact, I love the tech  sector, they've beaten down the last couple of weeks because of investors  getting nervous.  That's been weak money, I think strong money is going to  come back in here towards the end of the quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  You agree with that Mike Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY:  I do completely.  It's opportunity here.  Market, there's a bit  under the markets goes higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tough first quarter for tech.  All right.  Scott, good to see  you sir.  Thank you. </p><p>MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, British Prime Minister Theresa May in the spotlight  this morning as formal negotiations for Brexit are underway.  How the  European Union is expected to respond as Britain moves to exit, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: Welcome  back!  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 19th, your top stories right now  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London is on edge, once again this morning.   At least one person has been killed and several others injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in north London; police are treating  this as a terrorist attack.  Meanwhile, Britain also focused on  negotiations for its exit from the European Union; those talks begin today  in Brussels.  We've got a lot at what's at stake.  The possibility of a  laptop ban as airlines scrambling, what it would mean for your trip to the  airport?  </p><p>And markets are rallying this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a  gain of 60 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average today at the open;  NASDAQ, strong by 35.  In Europe, markets are up across the board.  Take a  look at the indices in the Eurozone with the FTSE 100, up one-half of one  percent; and the CAC40 and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  In Asia,  overnight, mostly higher as you see across the board, actually; Nikkei  Average in Japan up two-thirds of a percent; Hang Seng Index and Hong Kong  up better one percent.  </p><p>And the Southwest facing blazing hot triple digit temperatures today,  that's not keeping tourist away though, in fact, they are flocking to Death  Valley.  We will tell you all about it.  Amazon and Wal-Mart on a collision  course for sure now, Wal-Mart announcing its own deal; what the competition  means for the company is coming up.  And the Vice President getting an  extra special Father's Day present; the Pence family welcome two new furry  members: a kitten and a puppy.  All of those stories coming up this  morning.  </p><p>First, our top stories this half an hour: Britain has been rocked by a  tragedy yet again.  London police are investigating a possible terrorist  attack outside of a mosque late last night.  Investigators say that a 40- year-old man rammed a van into a crowd injuring ten people, at least.  One  man was found dead at the scene; it is unclear, however, if that death is  related to this attack.  Prime Minister, Theresa May, is planning to hold  an emergency meeting on the case later today.  </p><p>Joining us right now: the Wall Street Journal U.K. and Brexit Editor,  Stephen Fidler.  Steven, good to have you, thanks so much for joining us.   I want to get to Britain exiting the E.U. in a moment, but first, this is  the fourth major attack in the U.K. since March; what is your reaction?  </p><p>STEPHEN FIDLER, WALL STREET JOURNAL AND BREXIT EDITOR:  Well, I think it's  certainly a surprise than worried people here.  And I think there's an  extra air of uncertainty, not only with these attacks but with the building  fire last Wednesday.  So, London, in particular, I think is feeling this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a feeling that things need to change in terms of  security?  I mean, how are people feeling in terms of why this is  happening, why London has been under such attack just in the last three  months or so?</p><p>FIDLER:  Well, I think the - I think there is a sense that things need to  change, and there is a question that obviously the security services have  in terms of what they're going to do to deal with people who appear radical  but don't necessarily appear set of violence, you know, what to do to stop  these people going into violence.  So, that's one thing; I think there'll  be a lot of community policing and these kinds of things.  So, I would say,  you know, London has noticed this, but I was down at Borough Market despite  those attacks on London Bridge a week or so ago on Friday, and the place  was just teeming with people.  I mean, it's a - you know, London isn't  shutting down in any sense.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  I'm curious what the political  environment is like there?  Here in the U.S., people say enough with the  partisanship.  It seems like the U.K. is having a very, very similar  experience right now.  And I'm just curious how people are looking at  Theresa May, and is she going to be able to lead us through this?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think you hit on something there.  I think there is a lot of  political uncertainty, particularly given what the election result was last  - a couple weeks ago.  In a sense that she expected to come with an  increased majority; we expected to have a stronger government, and in many  ways, we have a weaker one, she doesn't even have a majority in the House  Commons.  And it looks like she's kind of uncertain in handling a lot of  these things.  You know, she hasn't been very adept at adjusting to and  dealing with the crisis as they've come one after the other.  So, I think,  you know, there is the sense of the government is, you know, not reacting  to this very well, and that she, in particular, is struggling to cope with  all of the things on her plate, you know, including the Brexit negotiation  which is starting today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIVE:  Stephen, you  just something, I think is very important, you just referred to community  policing when you talk about how we try to get ahead of the curve here.  To  what degree do you think the Met Police, or MI-5, or others had had or  having success in developing some line of communication within the Muslim  communities here in the U.K?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think they've done that.  Obviously, they'll be looking at  what's happened and figure they haven't done it will enough, and it's one  of those things that's come into the political debate here which is whether  the cutbacks that have taken place in terms of government spending since  the financial crisis certainly have reduced the numbers of policemen and  reduced the numbers of police on the streets.  So, that sends at the  political debate with the Labour Party saying, you know, this is a  consequence of the conservative policies that there aren't as many police  on the street as they used to be in, and the community policing that used  to go on five years ago or so, isn't happening to the same degree now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to be watching that.  That's a really  important point to bring up.  Let me switch gears and ask you about talks  officially underway now for Britain to leave the European Union; what are  you expecting here, Stephen, in terms of David Davis-the Brexit Secretary- meeting with the E.U.'s Chief Negotiator in Brussels; that meeting  happening right now.  David said that you're determined to build a strong  partnership.  Listen to this; I want to get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, BREXIT SECRETARY:  There's more that unites us than divides  us.  So, while we were ghastly to be, challenging times ahead of us in the  negotiations, we will do all we can to assure that we deliver that works in  the best interest of all citizens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there are concerns that Prime Minister  Theresa May's government is too fragile when she the majority in the snap  election two weeks ago.  Their growing calls for her to drop her plan of  the hard exit out of the E.U.; what are your thoughts here?  How does this  play out?  </p><p>FIDLER:  Well, it's a - I think a when Theresa May called an election in  April, there was a feeling in Europe, in Brussel that, OK, we're going to  have a stronger leader in the U.K. that can deliver on the promises she  makes in the negotiations.  So, that hasn't happened.  So, I think on the  other side of the, you know, from European Union perspective, there is sort  of, you know, a lot questions about who they're dealing, and whether this  woman is going to be in charge six months from now, and whether they should  make concessions in negotiations with someone who might not be around for a  very long.  </p><p>And on the other hand, as you say, in the U.K., she less able to deliver on  the promises, you know, because the House of Commons is divided, as some of  their own party don't want the kind of hard  Brexit.  And you know, it's  possible that the House of Commons or the House of Lords, which is the  unelected second chamber could overturn a lot of what she's trying to do.   So, I think we're entering these negotiations only 21 months to go before  the U.K. leaves the E.U. in a very uncertain situation.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF VENTURES FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Stephen,  it's Mike Murphy, I would think of these recent attacks that's in the U.K.  that the people who are going to be voting would want to be more for  Brexit, so that they could kind of control their borders, and maybe be  safer as a group.  Do you see that gaining any momentum kind of the pro- Brexit crowd because of the recent attacks?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I don't see that as a - the opinion polls don't seem to show that.   I mean, there is an element of that in the discussions.  I mean, you know,  even in the European Union, the UK. could - you know, they're always  possible controls from other people coming in for the U.K.  So, it's not  quite true to say the U.K. didn't control these borders.  What it had an  issue with was people coming into, and working in the U.K. from other parts  of the European Union, and the U.K. could say, quote his answer.  So, I  think there's a slightly different questionnaire, and I think from the  other side of the coin is the state of the British economy.  I mean, the  pound fell very sharply after the referendum last year.  Inflation is  starting to feed through, and people are fighting their standard of living  being eroded.  So, maybe that the sorts of an anti-Brexit crowd are kind of  getting a little more growing, somewhat, because of concerns about the  economy.  </p><p>BAKER:  Stephen, Mike Baker here again, do you feel that comment of David  Davis is correct when he said that there's more that unites the U.K. with  U.E. and then divides you?  </p><p>FIDLER:  I think there's a -- there's a sense in both - in which both sides  want a good deal out of this.  I don't think it's in any - nobody thinks  it's in their interest, but this all blows up and that's a sort of a big  break, or at least very few people think that's a - that's a great idea.   So, I think that's true.  I think that the thing that's left unsaid and  really that the U.K. hasn't held its answer is what actually do they  (INAUDIBLE) from this new relationship.  And certainly, some of the things  that they've outlined don't seem to be likely to be agreed on the other  side.  So, I think the - actually, the E.U. said much more about what it's  -- how it's going to approach the negotiations than the U.K. - than the  U.K. has.  There are a lot of unanswered questions about what the U.K.  really is looking for out of all of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen, then new developments in France, newly elected  President, Emanuel Macron consolidating power.  His party obviously winning  a clear majority in parliament overnight what does this victory mean for  the E.U.?</p><p>FIDLER:  It's interesting because it's contrast very much with what's going  on in the U.K., where you have - you have a leadership that is weakened.   Now, we've had this guy coming almost from nowhere in a year, creating a  political movement, becoming the President of France and gaining a huge  majority in the parliament to push through the kind of things that he said  he wants to do, which is including reforming the French slave market.  So,  I think the narrative in which the U.K. went into the sort of referendum  which was a declining European Union and sort of strengthening Britain.   That sort of - that kind of mood music has changed because I think the --  to some extent, anyway, and I wouldn't want to exaggerate this, the E.U.  has got its mojo back partly thanks to, what, some Macron who was a very  pro-E.U. candidate is doing, and also the fact that Angela Merkel looks as  if she's going to come back as chancellor, possibly with, you know,  increased majority or an increased size of her party.</p><p>So, in a sense, you know, it looks like the E.U. is sort of moving forward  to an extent that we didn't expect a year ago.  I mean, Macron's problem is  going to be not in the parliament now.  The question is going to be, what  happens in the streets?  How are they going to react?  The trade unions and  others, how are they going to react to what he's trying to do in the labor  market and to reform the economy?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's an important point, and that obviously becomes  clearer over the months and days to come.  Stephen, great to get your  insights.  Thanks so much.  Stephen Fidler joining us this morning in  London.</p><p>FIDLER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Boeing takes flight with a new plane.  How the  jetliner could rub up competition against rival, Airbus.  Stock has been on  fire of Boeing.  Then, Vice President Mike Pence ads some four-legged  friends to his family.  Their cute new pet social media debut, straight  ahead.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher this morning.  Take a  look at Futures indicating a pretty good rally at the opening of trading.   68 points higher on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  We're watching a  couple of names for you.  Boeing unveiled its first new jet in four years.   The company will develop a bigger 737.  Boeing says 10 customers have  already committed to buying that plane.  The announcement coming at the  Paris air show as the jetmaker looks to take on rising competition from  Airbus.</p><p>We are watching the banks this morning, including JPMorgan Chase.  The  Federal Reserve is set to release the latest result of the stress test  beginning Thursday this week.  Investors are hoping that the banks will get  approval to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends.  And U.S.  Airlines gearing up for the possibility of an expanded ban of carryon  laptops.  Cheryl Casone on that detail right now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria, we were thinking  that we might get news like this.  So, that initial ban that was put into  effect in May by the U.S. and the U.K. did affect some flights from the  Middle East and North Africa.  A ban now under consideration by the Trump  administration would involve flights originating for as many as 71 airports  around the world.  Big expansion.  That would mean additional security  checks and most likely a lot of angry international customers.  </p><p>Well, we're watching an extreme heat wave happening right now as out in the  southwest, parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah all really  suffering.  Temperatures expected to climb well above 110 degrees this week  in several parts of that region.  Death Valley, that's the hottest place in  America could see, get this, 124 degrees tomorrow.  And we are told that  some tourists actually finding to go there to experience Death Valley in  124 degrees.  No, not a smart idea.  </p><p>All right.  Another headlines this morning.  Good God.  Wal-Mart is going  shopping for an online retailer.  The company - this actually went down on  Friday, Maria, is buying Bonobos, they sell men's clothing for $310 million  in cash.  Now, this deal coming as Wal-Mart takes on Amazon for the future  of retail, and of course, it's on the same date that Amazon announced the  big deal, of course, to buy whole foods.  Wal-Mart has been moving  aggressively to try and transform himself into a major e-commerce power.   They bought jet.com last year for more than $3 billion (AUDIO GAP) today as  you could see on your chart under pressure, though, this morning.</p><p>And then, Vice President Mike Pence celebrated Father's Day by adding two  new members to the family.  The Pences welcomed a new kitten and dog into  their home.  The V.P.'s daughter, Charlotte, posted pictures of the new  addition, Charlie and Hazel.  They replaced the Pence's beagle, Maverick,  who died shortly before for the election.  And then (INAUDIBLE) of a cat,  Oreo, who passed away earlier this month.  They joined Pickles, another  family cat, by the way.  And they also have a bunny, Maria, named Marilyn  Van Dough.  They love (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Marilyn, Hazel, Pickles.  I love it.  I love it. </p><p>CARTER:  I always trust people who - I always trust people who love animals  more than those that's -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me, too.  That's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are on this story, ladies and gentlemen.  For all  new Mike Pence pet news, you (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of pets.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  fighting crime and making a return on your investment at the same time.   Why superhero comic books are trending at the auction block.  We'll tell  you about it, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  May 2017 was a win for comic books with $48.2  million worth of merchandise ordered.  This after comic book sales had a  20-year sales record last August who was (INAUDIBLE) by the success of both  the Marvel and D.C. Film Universes.  Joining me right now is  ComicConnect.com COO, Vincent Zurzolo.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much  for being here.</p><p>VINCENT ZURZOLO, COMICCONNECT.COM CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your auction of nearly 18,000 comics just closed last  night.  How did it go?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  We had a record week last week.  Closed from Monday through  Friday last week, and preauction estimated were $4 to $5 million.  We broke  $7 million on the auction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  We can make the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think is behind this obsession with comic books  that we have.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Well, I think people are very nostalgic and they're trying to  recapture the happiest times of their life, their childhood.  But I also  think it has a lot to do with the - that comic books have become  commodities.  They are all encapsulated in hard plastic holders from CGC  grading company which is the world's largest grading company.  And they are  encapsulated in these comic book holders, and it makes people who don't  know how to grade a comic book makes them able to buy and sell comic books.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because actually we're looking - I  was thinking, yes, there is that, that we want to relive our childhood, and  I'm thinking, \"Well, that's really wholesome, right?\"  But some comics are  not wholesome.  I've seen a lot of comics.  My husband likes comic books.   And some of these comic books get serious.  I mean, it's not so wholesome.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Well, they're not all for little kids.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Exactly.  Like my husband.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  You know, so there are - there you go.  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what is the attraction, do you think?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  So, I think it's nostalgia, I think it's this idea that you -  it's a form of entertainment, it's escapism, it's a form of investing.   People are not so in love with - I think nowadays ever since the recession,  traditional forms of investment.  They have to have - become their own type  of investor.  So, they look at things they love, tangible assets like  vintage comic books.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And one of them that you brought in was the comic in which  Superman appears for the second time.  Let's look at that one here.  How  much does that one go for at all?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  This comic book, the second cover appearance of Superman went for  $188,000.  What's important about this is, this is the court case copy.   This was used when D.C. Comics sued Fox who had made an intimation Superman  back in the 40s, 30s and 40s.  And -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's show that one.  That's this one right here.  Yes.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Because if you the stamp, the court case stamp.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is the court case stamp.  Wow.  Because they made a  Superman -</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes, Wonderman who was kind of a rip off from Superman.  But this  is the comic book that sold for the most in our auction is the first  appearance of Superman in action comics number one.  Now, my company holds  records, world record.  We sold the first million-dollar comic book, 1.5,  2.2, and over 3 million.  This copy is conserved.  It has a little bit of  conservation done to it to maintain the structural integrity.  This comic  book, we estimated to sell for about $200 to $250,000, sold for $393,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  What -- now what does a collector do with that?   Just keep it covered and it's just - that's the price.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  I think it's in their safe or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $300,000 for a comic?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  $393,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Almost 400 grand for this cover.  Batman, a  significant character in D.C. Comics.  Why did that one bring in such a  large amount of money?  Tell us about the Batman.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  So, Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman.  This  comic book is actually restored.  If it wasn't restored, it would sell for  over a million dollars easy.  This comic we estimated to sell for about 200  to 250.  It sold for $313,000.  People love Batman, they love Superman.   These are two of the biggest characters in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  But what about characters today?  Are there new  characters that have emerged today that perhaps could command these kinds  of numbers? </p><p>ZURZOLO:  You know, there's a comic book that came out.  You might have  heard of it, The Walking Dead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>ZURZOLO:  Yes.  Well, it's a huge T.V. show.  Walking dead is huge.  That's  comic book in perfect condition.  The number one copy can sell for over  $3,000, which is really exciting.  Our company will be bringing the world's  best collection of Walking Dead to auction later this year to coincide with  New York Comic-Con as well as an original art collection that's going to  blow the minds of many people around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how do you choose something like that, Walking Dead.  Why  did you think Walking Dead would be a good thing?</p><p>ZURZOLO:  I never did.  You know, it's not my market.  But I started  reading them and a comic book done in black and white that was done so  effectively.  It was just amazing.  When you read the original comic book,  you understand why it's become a worldwide phenomenon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating.  Vincent, great to have you.  Thanks so much for  walking us through it.  </p><p>ZURZOLO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Vincent Zurzolo there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  Congressman Steve Scalise's condition has improved.  He is upgraded from  critical to serious, just coming after he was shoot last week during  baseball practice with other Republican lawmakers.  The details next hour.   MORNINGS WITH MARIA back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p>In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p>BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p>BAKER:  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p>They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p>A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p>Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p>And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p>So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p>And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p>Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p>Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p>And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p>BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p>BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p>I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p>CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p>MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p>KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p>BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p>KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p>KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p>KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p>Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.  What we know about the attacker this morning.   Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.  </p><p>Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues.  The  Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire  Whole Foods.  The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning!  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p>And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.  Brooks Koepka,  making a name for himself at U.S. Open.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Koepka, a major champion </p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The impact on one of his main sponsors; we'll take a look at  the shares of Nike coming up.  Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p>WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p>PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p>But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p>PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na&lt;ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p>MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p>BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p>PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p>We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p>MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p>BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p>And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p>CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p>CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  As requested, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on  deck.  Charles Payne in for Stuart, Charles take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p>In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p>BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p>BAKER:  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p>They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p>A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p>Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p>And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p>So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p>And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p>Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p>Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p>And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p>BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p>BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p>I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p>CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p>MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p>KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p>BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p>KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p>KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p>KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p>Coming up.

Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.

Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p>WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p>PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p>But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p>PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na&lt;ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p>MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p>BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p>PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p>We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p>MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p>BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p>And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p>CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p>CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  As requested, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on  deck.  Charles Payne in for Stuart, Charles take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p>In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p>BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p>BAKER:  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p>They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p>A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p>Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p>And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p>So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p>And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p>Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p>Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p>And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p>BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p>BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p>I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p>CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p>MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p>KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p>BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p>KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p>KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p>KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p>Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.  What we know about the attacker this morning.   Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.  </p><p>Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues.

Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p>And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.

Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p>WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p>PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p>But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p>PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na&lt;ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p>MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p>BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p>PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p>We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p>MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p>BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p>And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p>CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p>CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  As requested, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on  deck.  Charles Payne in for Stuart, Charles take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p>In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p>BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p>BAKER:  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p>They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p>A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p>Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p>And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p>So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p>GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p>And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p>Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p>Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p>And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p>BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p>BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p>I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p>CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p>MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p>KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p>BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p>KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p>KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p>KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p>Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.  What we know about the attacker this morning.   Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.  </p><p>Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues.  The  Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire  Whole Foods.  The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning!  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p>And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.  Brooks Koepka,  making a name for himself at U.S. Open.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Koepka, a major champion </p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The impact on one of his main sponsors; we'll take a look at  the shares of Nike coming up.  Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p>WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p>PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p>But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p>PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na&lt;ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p>MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p>BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p>PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p>We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p>MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p>BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p>And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p>CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p>CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  As requested, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on  deck.  Charles Payne in for Stuart, Charles take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p> In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p> MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p> BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p> BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p> MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p> BAKER:  OK.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p> They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p> A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p> Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p> NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p> DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p> And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p> So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p> And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p> Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p> Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p> And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p> CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p> BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p> BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p> I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p> CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p> MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p> KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p> BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p> KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p> KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p> KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p> Coming up.  Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead,  nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a  mosque in Northern London.  What we know about the attacker this morning.   Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.  </p><p> Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues.  The  Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire  Whole Foods.  The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Monday morning!  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 19th, your top  stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  London on edge again, this  morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man  plows a van into a crowd near a mosque.  British Prime Minister, Theresa  May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming  up.  </p><p> Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just  moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good  healthcare, and border security.  Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.  General Motors moving  jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open  a new plant in Texas.</p><p> And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the  opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average,  50 points on the NASDAQ composite.  In Europe, this morning, also the  indices are across the board up.  Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one  percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent.  And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.  Brooks Koepka,  making a name for himself at U.S. Open.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Koepka, a major champion </p><p> (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The impact on one of his main sponsors; we'll take a look at  the shares of Nike coming up.  Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p> WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p> PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p> PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p> But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p> PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p> PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na&lt;ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p> MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p> BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p> MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p> CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p> PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p> We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p> MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p> MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p> BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p> Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p> And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p> CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p> MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p> BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p> MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p> CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  As requested, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on  deck.  Charles Payne in for Stuart, Charles take it away.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.
