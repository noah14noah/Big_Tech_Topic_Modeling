McKinnon and Ryan Tracy   WASHINGTON -- Powerful technology companies are expected to face increased scrutiny no matter who wins the Nov. 3 election, but President Trump and challenger Joe Biden differ on some of the problems posed by Big Tech and how to solve them.    In a second term, Mr. Trump and his appointees likely would maintain -- and possibly accelerate -- the broad-scale regulatory scrutiny of technology companies that marked his first term. That effort has included allegations of anticonservative bias online, antitrust investigations of internet giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc., and actions against Chinese-owned apps such as TikTok and WeChat.    Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, has also been critical of Big Tech's market power. He and running mate Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) say they would support stricter antitrust oversight and online privacy rules. But the Biden camp has emphasized forcing social-media companies to better police their sites against false information, and taking government action to help workers under threat from innovations such as self-driving cars.    With Congress also focused on Big Tech, both candidates are likely to take a hand in legislative efforts to increase competition in digital markets, expand broadband access and protect consumers' privacy.    \"The hands-off approach is gone, regardless of who wins the election,\" said Gene Kimmelman, a former Obama administration antitrust official who recently co-wrote a paper calling for a new agency to regulate large digital platforms.    Antitrust    The Obama administration -- in which Mr. Biden served as vice president -- developed a tech-friendly reputation, hiring Silicon Valley veterans for key posts and declining to pursue antitrust complaints against Google and others. Some conservative and progressive tech critics alike worry that a Biden administration would take up that stance again, settling any antitrust cases brought by the Trump administration on lenient terms.    Biden campaign spokesman Matt Hill declined to comment on the prospect for settling antitrust cases, but suggested Mr. Biden would be tough.    \"Joe Biden has long said one of the greatest sins is the abuse of power, \" Mr. Hill said. \"Many technology giants and their executives have not only abused their power, but misled the American people, damaged our democracy, and evaded any form of responsibility. That ends with a President Biden.\"    The Trump campaign says leniency ended with the incumbent's 2016 election. The Justice Department in the Trump administration has been investigating Google for potential anticompetitive conduct in its search and advertising business, and is expected to file a case before the election that likely would carry over into 2021 and beyond. The Federal Trade Commission is also investigating tech companies for potential antitrust violations, including preparing a possible lawsuit against Facebook.    During the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden didn't join progressives calling to break up Big Tech firms, saying it would be premature to do so before a formal investigation. This summer, a policy task force Mr. Biden created with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, his final Democratic primary opponent, recommended breaking up companies for anticompetitive behavior \"as a last resort.\"    Nevertheless, Mr. Biden has said that antitrust enforcement hasn't been strong enough and that tech firms deserve a hard look from the federal agencies that oversee competition.    Mr. Trump hasn't called for tech breakups either, though that is one possible outcome of the continuing antitrust investigations.    Tech's liability shield    A particular focus for a second Trump term would be legislation to scale back protections social-media companies enjoy under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which gives them broad legal immunity for posted content and their efforts to moderate it. Mr. Trump says the law has been used to censor conservative viewpoints.    Mr. Trump called for repeal of Section 230 in a Sept. 8 tweet, echoing a position Mr. Biden took earlier this year with a very different motivation. Even so, the law is considered foundational to the internet and has bipartisan support.    Mr. Trump ordered regulatory agencies this year to consider tougher oversight of online companies under Section 230 when they don't moderate users' speech fairly or fail to live up to their promises relating to free speech.    \"It's become evident that Big Tech believes they are the arbiters of truth online -- but they have a clear blind spot when it comes to their bias against conservative voices,\" said Samantha Zager, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. \"President Trump will continue to advocate for an internet that embraces free speech over censorship.\"    As a sign of the issue's importance to the White House, Mr. Trump recently withdrew the renomination of a Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission after he expressed concern about the legal basis for Mr. Trump's tougher line on Section 230. The White House has also pressured the Republican chairman of the FTC, Joseph Simons, to take more action to support the effort, according to people familiar with the matter.    Mr. Biden surprised the tech world when he called for revoking Section 230. But unlike conservatives, Mr. Biden says some social-media platforms do too little policing, not too much.    His campaign website devoted an entire page to criticizing Facebook and its relatively hands-off policy when it comes to policing political speech. Some critics say that policy benefits Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden has termed the company irresponsible.    Mr. Biden hasn't outlined what new policy might replace Section 230, but he appears to want social-media companies to be more active, not less, in taking down content -- especially what the Biden campaign views as false information promoted by pro-Trump groups. Facebook says it is important to allow voters to see the statements of political candidates.    Mr. Trump and other Republicans have their own frustrations with Facebook, which has removed some Trump campaign ads and some of the president's statements about the coronavirus.    But they have also at times praised the company's decisions, such as when it declined to join rivals such as Twitter Inc. in labeling and shielding from public view a post from Mr. Trump about violent protests.    Job protections    Mr. Biden has expressed concerns about the potential impacts of many tech innovations, such as self-driving vehicles, on people with middle-class jobs. \"Whether your predictions are true about automation and self-driving trucks, these folks aren't stupid,\" he said in a speech in 2018 at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"They listen, they understand and they're scared to death.\" Among Mr. Biden's proposed solutions are such ideas as providing extra government aid to help workers who have been dislocated by tech.    The former vice president has also been outspoken about using government regulation to force \"gig economy\" businesses to pay benefits to their independent contractors, by reclassifying them as employees. California has been testing such a policy.    In a New York Times interview early this year, Mr. Biden described meeting as vice president with tech leaders -- \"little creeps,\" he called them -- touting their industry's economic benefit.    \"'You have fewer people on your payroll than all the losses that General Motors just faced in the last quarter, of employees. So don't lecture me about how you've created all this employment,'\" Mr. Biden said he responded.    The Trump campaign said policies like California's gig-worker law \"take away workers' opportunity to make their own schedules and participate in a free and open gig economy.\"    The Labor Department, which is led by a Trump appointee, last year said people offering services on online sites or apps should be considered employees of the consumer who hires them, not the virtual marketplace. That policy could make it harder for gig workers to win labor disputes.    The Trump administration has also sought to expand the availability of worker training through apprenticeships, in part by making it easier for businesses to run their own apprentice programs.

That's according to a side-by-side analysis of the two candidates' tech records by the Information Technology &amp;#38; Innovation Foundation shared exclusively with Axios.Why it matters: The tech industry needs to prepare for either four more years of Trump's impulsive policy approach or for a Biden administration that's likely to be critical of tech but slow to take action. Context: ITIF, which compiled the research[1], is an industry-friendly think tank with tech executives on its board.What they're saying: The report frames the central tech issue as China's challenge to American dominance. </p><p>\"The reality is that America is no longer the global innovation leader, at least on a per capita basis, and it risks losing out to China over the next decade or two.... Whether or not the two major parties understand this threat and want to prioritize it is unclear,\" the report's authors write. Some topics the report highlights: Research and development: Biden has declared support for more investment in R&amp;#38;D. Trump has proposed increased funding for artificial intelligence but has been trying to cut support for research overall.China: Trump focuses on being tough on China (see: the ongoing TikTok saga) and embraces a unilateral trade approach. Biden has said he wants to be aggressive with China but favors working more closely with allies on trade policy.Immigration: Biden embraces his party's less restrictive vision on immigration, including the high-skilled worker program many tech companies heavily rely on. Trump has repeatedly worked to curb all types of immigration.Antitrust and content moderation: Both candidates support potential antitrust actions against large technology companies and curbing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from liability for user-posted content.Hate speech and misinformation: Both Trump and Biden say online platforms need to change how they moderate content online. Biden says more needs to be done to prevent misinformation and hate speech, while Trump has repeatedly accused platforms of anti-conservative bias.Privacy: Both candidates support a national data privacy bill.Telecommunications: Trump's Federal Communications Commission rolled back Obama-era net neutrality rules. That \"outraged\" Biden, according to a CNET report[2]. The bottom line: Republicans and Democrats have both grown more critical of tech since 2016 while continuing to support measures that help the industry stay competitive globally.

Many of the Democratic presidential candidates have argued in favour of either breaking up or tightening regulation of firms such as Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc's Google and Amazon.com Inc . Republican President Donald Trump's administration has also stepped up its scrutiny, announcing a wide-ranging investigation in July into whether major digital tech companies engaged in anti-competitive practices. Trump's Democratic challengers also criticise online platforms for allowing politicians to make false claims in advertising ahead of the election next November. Social media platforms are under particular scrutiny after U.S. intelligence agencies said Russia used them to wage an influence operation to interfere with the 2016 election - a claim Moscow has denied. Here are some of the candidates' positions on Big Tech. </p><p>PRESIDENT TRUMP Trump, whose social media use and digital advertising campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, in September attacked the \"immense power\" of social media giants in his address to the United Nations. Trump has stopped short of calling for tech giants to be broken up, as Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have, but said \"obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly,\" when asked about major tech companies in a June interview with CNBC. Trump and other Republicans have also criticized social media companies, without evidence, for alleged political bias. The president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. wrote an opinion piece for The Hill political website in September entitled \"Free speech suppression online builds case to break up Big Tech.\" Silicon Valley firms have also been at odds with the Trump administration over policies such as its repeal of Obama-era net neutrality rules and the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on their supply chains. JOE BIDEN Biden, who was vice president in the Silicon Valley-friendly Obama administration, has taken a more moderate stance than his progressive rivals on the issue of big tech company break-ups. In a May interview with the Associated Press, he said that splitting up companies such as Facebook was \"something we should take a really hard look at\" but that it was \"premature\" to make a final judgment. The campaign told Reuters that, as president, Biden would aggressively use \"all the tools available - including utilizing antitrust measures\" to ensure corporations act responsibly. He did not speak up during a discussion of the issue at the most recent Democratic debate in October. Biden has criticized e-commerce giant Amazon's US$0 federal tax bill in 2018. \"I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth,\" he said in a tweet in June. His campaign also clashed with Facebook, Twitter and Google over their political ad policies after they refused to take down a Trump ad that the Biden team said contained false claims about his son Hunter's dealings with Ukraine. ELIZABETH WARREN Warren is leading the charge to break up big tech companies on the grounds they hold outsized influence and stifle competition. She has called for legislation to restrict large tech platforms - which she would designate as \"platform utilities\" -from owning and participating in a marketplace at the same time. Under this law, Apple would not be allowed to both run the App Store and sell its own apps on it, for example. She also said she would nominate regulators to unwind anti-competitive mergers such as Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, and Amazon's deal for Whole Foods. Warren in October challenged Facebook's policy of exempting politicians' ads from fact-checking by running ads containing the false claim that CEO Mark Zuckerberg was endorsing Trump's re-election bid. The senator from Massachusetts has also said that she would reject campaign donations over US$200 from executives of big tech firms. BERNIE SANDERS Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who frequently criticizes corporate influence, has also called for the break-up of big tech companies such as Facebook and Amazon. His administration would \"absolutely\" try to split apart the companies, Sanders said at a Washington Post event in July. He has said that he will have the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) review all mergers that have taken place during the Trump administration. His broad plan to reshape corporate America would also mandate all large companies to be owned partly by their workers. Asked how he differentiates himself from Warren on major issues, Sanders told ABC in October: \"Elizabeth considers herself - if I got the quote correctly - to be a capitalist to her bones. I don't.\" Sanders has been vocal in his attacks on Amazon over issues such as its tax contributions and working conditions at its warehouses. In 2018, he introduced a 'Stop BEZOS Act' in the Senate, in a reference to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, which would make large corporations either pay their workers more or pay the government for public benefits that their workers receive. PETE BUTTIGIEG In general, Pete Buttigieg, who became Facebook's 287th user shortly after it was launched in 2004 at Harvard University, where he was a student, has been more reluctant to slam the tech giants than some other candidates. The mayor from South Bend, Indiana, said that the break-up of big tech companies is a \"remedy that should be on the table,\" but also said it was not a politician's place to designate which companies should be broken up. He has said that the FTC should be empowered to prevent and sometimes reverse mergers, but argued that large tech companies should be scrutinized for their actions rather than their size. He says concerns over monopolies and concerns over data security or privacy should not be conflated. He is in favour of having legislation to protect individual data rights at a national level, including the right to be forgotten - which would give citizens the power to demand that online platforms delete data about them, as is the case in Europe. KAMALA HARRIS Senator Harris of California, the home of Silicon Valley, has said that Facebook has not been sufficiently regulated. She has not called outright for the break-up of big tech firms but said it should be \"seriously\" considered. During the campaign, Harris touted her experience protecting consumers' online privacy while she was state attorney general. In Congress, Harris, along with fellow candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar, introduced the bipartisan ENOUGH Act in 2017 to protect against online exploitation of private images. Harris recently called on Twitter to suspend Trump's Twitter account, saying his tweets threaten violence. In response, the company said that Trump's tweets did not violate its policies. AMY KLOBUCHAR The Minnesota senator has made oversight of big technology companies one of her major issues in Congress and argued for data privacy laws and net neutrality safeguards as priorities at her campaign launch in February. Klobuchar has called for tighter regulation of tech giants and suggested that companies who profit from users' data could be taxed. She has not endorsed Warren's plan for their break-up, saying that she would first want investigations. Her plan for her first 100 days in office includes an \"aggressive retrospective review of mergers,\" which she said she would pay for with an extra merger fee on \"megamergers.\" She is also one of the authors of the bipartisan Honest Ads Act, which would require social media platforms to disclose the purchaser of a political ad, as is required for television and print ads. ANDREW YANG Yang, the former CEO of a start-up, has benefited from a surge of grassroots supporters on social media who style themselves as the #yanggang. Although the technology entrepreneur said \"we would be well served\" if big tech companies were to break themselves up, he is more focused on dealing with the impact of automation on American jobs and on regulating artificial intelligence. Yang has also emphasized the negative effects of tech on mental health and said he would create a Department of Attention Economy, ideally led by tech ethics advocate Tristan Harris, to look at how to responsibly design and use apps and devices. He has also called for people to receive a share of the economic value generated from their data. CORY BOOKER New Jersey Senator Booker said that Warren's call to break up the tech giants was \"more like a Donald Trump thing to say\" and has instead argued that stronger antitrust laws need to be enforced. When questioned at the October Democratic debate on the issue, Booker advocated reforms to stop tech companies being used \"to undermine our democracy\" around elections. He talked broadly about antitrust, \"from pharma to farms,\" but did not single out tech companies. A Stanford University graduate who co-founded his own social media start-up WayWire, Booker has historically received donations from major Silicon Valley names such as Zuckerberg. The Facebook CEO also donated US$100 million to Newark schools when Booker was mayor of the New Jersey city. BETO O'ROURKE O'Rourke, a former U.S. representative from Texas, wants to see Big Tech regulated rather than broken up. He has said he does not think it is the role of a president to designate which companies should be dismantled. O'Rourke's campaign told Reuters he would stand up for small business by preventing online platform owners from promoting their own content and products over that of competitors. He also plans to create a new digital markets regulator to create and enforce rules on issues such as privacy and data mobility. O'Rourke, who as a teenager was part of an influential hacking group, has also said he thinks social media companies should be treated as publishers. He wants to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally provides immunity to online platforms for content posted by users, to make social media companies more accountable for the amplification of hate speech and domestic terrorism on their platforms. His campaign recently urged Facebook, Twitter and Google to do more to combat online disinformation, after the campaign encountered the spread of a false claim about a gunman in a mass shooting. JULIAN CASTRO Castro, who was secretary of housing and urban development in the Obama administration, has said it is worth considering proposals to break up the big tech companies and said during the recent Democratic debate that the U.S. needs to take a stronger stance in cracking down on monopolistic trade practices. In the October debate, the former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, also singled out Amazon by name for helping to \"put small businesses out of business\" and for \"shortchanging a lot of its workers.\" TULSI GABBARD Gabbard, a U.S. representative from Hawaii, has called for the break-up of big tech companies and praised Warren's plan. In July, she filed a US$50 million lawsuit against Google accusing the company of discrimination when it temporarily suspended her ad account after the first Democratic debate. Google said the account had been automatically flagged for unusual activity, without specifying exactly what the issue was. Gabbard said that Google's actions reflected \"how the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values.\" TOM STEYER California billionaire Steyer has said he is running for president to remove the influence of corporate money from politics. In the October debate, he said that monopolies either have to be dismantled or regulated, but that to win against Trump, Democrats would have to \"show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies.\" Instead, he said, Democrats must harness the innovation and competition of the private sector. Steyer's campaign has been noted for its massive ad spending which helped push him to the debate stage, including more than US$6 million in Facebook ads, according to Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive.

Republican President Donald Trump's administration has also stepped up its scrutiny of Big Tech, conducting a wide-ranging probe into whether major digital tech companies engaged in anticompetitive practices. Social media platforms are under particular scrutiny over their efforts to curb dissemination of misinformation and false claims, years after U.S. intelligence agencies said Russia used them to wage an influence operation aimed at interfering with the 2016 election. Moscow has denied the claim.

It's true: We still need better ways to get from here to there. But in recent years, engineers have been working on some pretty exciting stuff. Cars drive themselves-without burning gas. Data collection could transform public transportation. Algorithms are being harnessed to change traffic patterns.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This could be the cusp of a transformation that could, one day, even include &amp;#230; self-flying cars?</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To get a peek at the future of transportation, you could start by visiting a warehouse building in an industrial stretch of Mountain View, California. Above the door, which has its window papered over, a safety sign catalogs various health and fire hazards that lurk within. A red and black wet suit hangs in a tree nearby. Alex Roetter strolls over from another building, scans his security badge, and leads me inside. Roetter, who is a division president at this aviation startup, Kitty Hawk, steps into a vast room with cement floors. There, arrayed in a U shape, are 13 or so Flyers, an oddball aircraft that few people have seen and even fewer have piloted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's the kind of vehicle that anyone can learn to fly in 15 minutes,\" Roetter says. \"The computer does all the hard work, so the human is just left to do the things that people are really good at. Look out the window, decide where you want to go, and just point the stick to where you want to go, and land.\"</p><p>The Flyer is an airborne trimaran in gleaming white. The middle pod, where the pilot sits, resembles a Formula 1 car cockpit. It's flanked by a pair of pontoons, so it can land on water as well as earth, with two beams protruding from their sides. With one seat and 10 propellers, it's 13 feet long, 7.5 feet wide, and 5 feet tall. Thanks to carbon fiber construction, the aircraft weighs in at only 250 pounds. Powered by electricity, it is remarkably quiet. It takes off, lands, and flies pretty much like a helicopter.</p><p>Actually, this is the second generation of the Flyer; the first, which Kitty Hawk showed off over San Francisco Bay in June 2017, looked like something a comic book villain might fly, with a seat you straddled. The shift to the protective cockpit, though, pales in importance compared with the transformation in the vehicle's onboard computers. Learning to fly the first version took several days: five hours in a simulator, a day of training, a series of flights while tethered to the ground. The new aircraft lets people with zero aviation experience take off after that 15-minute lesson, thanks to smarter software.</p><p>In a helicopter, the pilot works four controls at once, while monitoring how each impacts the others. In the Flyer, the pilot's left hand works a thumbwheel to go up or down. The right handles a joystick to send the aircraft forward, back, left, right, and around. Let go of the controls and the Flyer holds itself level and in place, like a ship at anchor. That's it. The digital 0s and 1s translate the human pilot's basic commands into aeronautic expertise. The computer sets rotor pitch and speed while using GPS, an inertial measurement unit, lidar laser scanning, and radar to ascertain its position in space. It's as easy as flying a quadcopter drone, except you are inside it.</p><p>Roetter has taken about half a dozen low-speed flights in the Flyer over water. He's more engineer than salesman-a software engineer, to be specific. The bullet point on his CV that won him this job was developing an advertising software tool at Twitter that generated billions in revenue. But he's also a licensed pilot, and he lights up while talking about the ride: \"It's like being a kid.\"</p><p>The Kitty Hawk model we're looking at is recreational, but what makes it more than a lark for thrill-seekers is that its creators see it as a first step toward something momentous-the flying car. \"Our long-term vision is to free the world from traffic,\" Roetter says. The idea is to create a vehicle that can soar over congestion, making short, driving-distance, point-to-point hops-all without fossil fuel emissions. That craft is \"probably not the Flyer,\" he continues, \"the same way that the Wright Flyer was not the vehicle that shrunk the Atlantic Ocean.\"</p><p>Orville and Wilbur Wright's airplane, which took off from the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903, was not sold commercially. It was 11 years before the business of passenger aviation got started, and another 25 before Pan Am inaugurated the first transatlantic service. \"Sometimes you do things in the beginning because they're the first thing,\" Roetter says. \"And you learn and grow from there.\"</p><p>Indeed, while Roetter's team works on the Flyer in the Bay Area, another division of Kitty Hawk is in New Zealand, refining and testing the company's second craft, the Cora. With room for two in its teardrop-shaped cabin, the 12-rotor electric aircraft can take off, fly, and land all by itself.</p><p>\"FLYING CARS AREN'T LIKE SMARTPHONES; YOU CAN'T LET COMPETING TECH AND PROTOCOLS COEXIST WHILE THE MARKET FIGURES IT OUT.\"</p><p>Kitty Hawk is far from the only enterprise with ambitions to reshape short-distance travel. Some two dozen companies-from mammoths like Boeing and Airbus to Volocopter in Germany and EHang in China, along with a raft of startups-are riding a jet stream of technological advances to create smaller, battery-powered flying vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries have gotten far cheaper and more energy-dense. Distributed propulsion, where a single power source supplies a bunch of small rotors instead of one big one, has enabled designs that are more efficient than helicopters. Boeing and Airbus convinced regulators that lightweight composite materials can withstand the rigors of commercial flight. Consumer drones proved that software could make controlling a complex vehicle as simple as working a joystick.</p><p>As Roetter walks through the warehouse, he points to a cracked pontoon on the airframe that was sacrificed for crash testing and flicks a rotor as he explains that on the Flyer, five propellers spin clockwise, five counterclockwise. At one end of the room a worker with a blowtorch applies a vinyl coating to one Flyer; at the other end, a small crane sits ready to hoist a finished craft into an aboveground pool, to verify that it can land on water without flooding. Other Flyers are waiting to have their battery packs installed in the pontoons or for the flight-control computers to be loaded into the hollow space behind the pilot's seat.</p><p>The Flyers that Kitty Hawk is building now are mostly heading to Nevada's Lake Las Vegas for flight testing, as the company continues to refine that all-important software. Crash testing is done via remote control, but if someone's in the thing, Roetter won't let them fly more than 10 feet up or faster than 20 mph.</p><p>These are early days.</p><p>The 21st-century flying-car industry took off in October 2016, when Uber announced it was working on an air taxi service called Elevate. The ride-hail giant wouldn't design or build vehicles itself. Instead, it would contract with manufacturers and help coordinate efforts among private and public players to work out regulation, build infrastructure, and develop an air-traffic management system. Once that's all settled and companies start delivering aircraft, Uber would pull them into an urban \"on-demand aviation\" service. Five manufacturers, including Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences, helicopter maker Bell, and Brazil's EmbraerX, have signed on to produce aircraft. Uber might buy and operate the vehicles itself or work with a company that owns them. The aircraft might fly themselves or have pilots.</p><p>Uber wants to launch a few flying cars for demonstration flights in Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth as soon as next year, with a proper commercial service in both metros by 2023. The idea is to move Uber's ease of use to the sky. You'd pull up an app that would connect you to a vehicle sitting on a helipad. The sweet spot would be routes that might take one or two hours to drive-San Francisco to San Jose, say-but 15 minutes to fly. Morgan Stanley predicts the market for these short-hop electric aircraft could be worth $1.5 trillion by 2040. Airbus wants to produce a \"productizable\" demo model next year. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg says flying cars will be real in the next five years. Yet for all the technological progress, actually delivering this dream safely to the skies will require a lot more than optimistic talking points.</p><p>On the day I make the long, traffic-clogged drive from Berkeley to Mountain View to meet Sebastian Thrun, Kitty Hawk's CEO, it's supposed to rain. Thrun meets me in the lobby, says hello, and notices my umbrella. He asks me if it's raining. I tell him no, but that the forecast said it might. \"Ah,\" he says with a grin. \"You are a pessimist.\"</p><p>Slender, with a shaved head and wearing a suit just because he felt like it today, Thrun looks the part of a 21st-century Captain Nemo. At a time of backlash against Big Tech, he bounces along with untroubled enthusiasm, a blue-eyed riposte to Peter Thiel's 2011 quip mocking Silicon Valley: \"We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\" By the time the German computer scientist was 36, he had tenure at Stanford University and was running its AI lab. In the mid-2000s he started working at Google, helping to create Street View and running Ground Truth, the massive effort that underpins Google Maps. Thrun launched the company's self-driving car project as well as Google X, its \"moon-shot factory.\" So it's no surprise that despite Thrun's lack of aviation experience, his frequent patron, Google's Larry Page, tapped him to run Kitty Hawk. (The company was founded in 2010 by Stanford aerodynamicist Ilan Kroo, who created an early version of what's now the Cora aircraft. Page became the main funder, put Thrun in charge of the effort in 2016, and named it Kitty Hawk.)</p><p>Thrun believes his latest venture can \"free the world from traffic,\" but he doesn't overestimate where things stand now. \"We're still in the infancy,\" he says, \"still at the very beginning.\"</p><p>The first problems Kitty Hawk, Uber, and their ilk must stare down are technical. Take propulsion: Battery tech is getting cheaper and more competitive with gasoline, but it doesn't provide anywhere near the energy density of jet fuel. For every pound of battery, you get 0.1 to 0.15 horsepower-hours. For liquid fuel, it's 7.3 horsepower-hours, a 50-fold advantage. Electric motors are more efficient than combustion engines, but not by enough to close that gap. And the work of building a machine that defies gravity means weight matters more than any other consideration, like the price of materials. \"In cars, the ranking is cost, volume, weight,\" says Richard Anderson, director of the Eagle Flight Research Center at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \"In airplanes, it's weight, weight, weight, volume, cost.\"</p><p>Reducing noise-a necessity for making flying cars ubiquitous-exacerbates the problem. You can quiet a flying car by slowing the rotors and changing their angle to produce more lift, but that requires more torque and more power. Basically, the less noisy an aircraft is, the more energy it demands.</p><p>Physics and chemistry can be brought to bear; battery power is getting better. The bigger obstacle (for flying-car fans, anyway) involves regulation. Self-driving-car developers have been able to charge ahead because they've found a hole in the regulatory regime; most states don't explicitly ban autonomous driving. (Congress has been kicking around legislation for nearly two years.) The sky is far more tightly controlled. The Federal Aviation Administration has to approve any new aircraft and does not easily make changes-let alone usher in a new form of urban flight.</p><p>First comes safety certification. For most aircraft, it takes years of testing-and the agency has never certified an electric aircraft for commercial use, let alone one that toggles between vertical and horizontal travel. It's not even clear how the FAA would classify something like Kitty Hawk's Cora, or if it would require an entirely new classification.</p><p>The software taking all the work away from the human pilot brings a different problem. Historically, the FAA has allowed only deterministic software, programs that produce the same results from the same inputs. To certify that code, Anderson of Embry-Riddle says, \"you have to test all the possible inputs that can go in and show that any output that comes out is not detrimental to the vehicle.\" But software that makes decisions about rotor speeds, aircraft angles, and what's an obstacle can't be tested that way. It's too complex.</p><p>Before flying cars can take off, the FAA must adopt a methodology that allows for a mathematical proof of safety. \"This has been accepted in automotive stuff for years, but the safety aspects of airplanes have made our folks drag their feet,\" Anderson says of the FAA. The agency sees significant potential in electric and autonomous aircraft, an FAA spokesperson says, \"but the operational rules for a self-flying or autonomous aircraft are not in place, and this type of operation has not been tested.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, Thrun and others have been encouraged by the FAA's recent efforts to allow for new types of aviation. In 2017 the agency dumped highly prescriptive rules for small planes in favor of performance-based standards. Essentially, it demanded that aircraft be safe instead of specifying how to make them so. And it has steadily relaxed its restrictions on drones. But some worry that this slackening comes with too much risk. \"It's not clear the FAA has the staffing or the expertise to independently confirm that the companies who say 'trust us' for the unmanned industry have really done due diligence to earn that,\" says Ella Atkins, who directs the University of Michigan's Autonomous Aerospace Systems Lab. And the recent crashes of two Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets, which killed 346 people between them, have raised questions about whether the regulator has become lax in how it lets companies certify new aircraft, especially aircraft that are so reliant on complex software.</p><p>Making sure flying cars won't crash and kill their occupants-and people on the ground-is not the only serious safety question. More vexing, perhaps, may be what happens when they fill the skies and threaten to crash into each other, or into buildings, birds, cell towers, and power lines. Flying cars, whether piloted by humans or software, will need far more sophisticated systems than anything currently guiding commercial jets. Alphabet's drone delivery company, Wing, has built its own air-traffic management system that assigns craft specific corridors of air space, and it has made parts of it open source in the hope that the industry will adopt the scheme. But flying cars aren't like smartphones; you can't let competing tech and protocols coexist while the market figures it out. Flying cars would require a single operating system-and therefore either a whole lot of cooperation between competing companies or a firm grip by the iron hand of regulators.</p><p>Solve all of that (piece of cake!) and the operational challenges of a flying-car service come into focus: What routes to fly, how much to charge, how to schedule maintenance without losing capacity. And what happens when someone gets sick and doesn't grab the barf bag in time. It's the kind of stuff airlines are used to dealing with, while Uber and upstarts like Kitty Hawk have to begin at square one.</p><p>In the entryway of Kitty Hawk's mountain view headquarters, a sign hangs above a bike rack, laying out the company's principles: WE DERIVE URGENCY FROM A NEW VISION FOR TRANSPORTATION, ONE THAT IS FREE OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND LONG RUSH HOUR DELAYS. Everyone working on this preaches the virtue of \"going 3D,\" obliterating bottlenecks by using the miles of air above our heads. And it's true that it's hard to imagine getting stuck in a jam when you have access to the whole sky. But we've been fooled before.</p><p>At the 1939 New York World's Fair, General Motors put on an exhibit called Futurama, designed to extol the virtues of driving. On a 17-minute ride in blue mohair armchairs, visitors took in a massive diorama of the American landscape, striated with ribbons of concrete. It was a vision of a national network of multilane interstates, full of cars but free of traffic. Less than two decades later, President Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act into law, paving the way for a 41,000-mile network of interstates-on which the average modern American driver gets stuck for nearly 100 hours a year.</p><p>Sebastian Thrun, though, isn't worried about his company's vision or the difficulty of realizing it. For a man who has taught cars to drive themselves and helped Google chart the world, taking flight is not just the exciting answer, it's the obvious one-what progress looks like. \"The first cars were like tricycles,\" he says. \"When it rained, you got wet.\" After he teases me about my umbrella, we walk outside. The skies are clear. Not a drop of rain lands on our heads.</p><p>ALEX DAVIES <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(@adavies47) runs the Transportation channel on</emphasis>WIRED<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.com.

One notable difference this time around, though, was the relative quiet of many large tech companies. In previous years, these firms had been outspoken about the issue. What changed?<br/>Netflix's net-neutrality journey is an illuminating example. In 2014, Reed Hastings, the company's CEO, <url normalizedValue=\"https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/internet-tolls-and-the-case-for-strong-net-neutrality\">issued</url> a strongly worded warning about oppressive \"internet tolls\" that could threaten the web's status as a \"platform for progress.\" His company had recently tussled with Comcast (ultimately agreeing to pay the cable company to get data for its streaming videos to customers smoothly) and Hastings felt a need to take a stand in favor of net neutrality. In advance of a 2015 Federal Communications Commission vote on the issue that went as Netflix hoped, the company's representatives       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/netflix-is-less-noisy-defender-of-net-neutrality-as-vote-arrives\">reportedly</url> contacted or visited FCC officials more than a dozen times.</p><p><br/>In the time between then and last week-when the FCC voted to undo its 2015 regulations-something, apparently, had changed. \"We think net neutrality is incredibly important,\" Hastings <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/5/31/15720268/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-net-neutrality-open-internet\">said</url> at a tech conference in late May, but went on to say that it's \"not narrowly important to us because we're big enough to get the deals we want.\" The \"deals\" he was referring to are the ones theoretically opened up by the repeal of net neutrality-they're the fees that internet-service providers (like Comcast) could ask for from, well, just about anyone (like Netflix), in exchange for speeding their data along. Netflix did submit two filings to the FCC in the run-up to last week's vote, but the commission didn't have any record of lobbying visits on the company's behalf during that time,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/netflix-is-less-noisy-defender-of-net-neutrality-as-vote-arrives\">according to Bloomberg</url>.<br/>What about that platform for progress? The reality is that Netflix and other large tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have grown so dominant that net neutrality has become a nonissue for them. They're aware that their extensive, loyal user bases can protect them from any unfavorable deals that internet-service providers (ISPs) might devise-there's leverage to be gained from becoming a platform that broadband customers expect ready access to. And unlike smaller businesses, which lack that leverage, big tech companies have the political clout to fight policies they don't want-should they choose to.<br/>Basically, these companies are aware of how much they've grown. When Netflix's CEO was complaining about \"internet tolls\" in 2014, the company's annual revenues       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/netflix-is-less-noisy-defender-of-net-neutrality-as-vote-arrives\">were $5.5 billion</url>; just three years later, they're estimated to be more than twice that. \"From [these companies'] standpoint, it doesn't really matter who's enforcing net neutrality, or if there's net neutrality at all-they don't need it,\" Larry Downes, a project director at Georgetown University's Center for Business and Public Policy, told me. \"They have all the leverage they need to make sure their content gets delivered as best it can be.\"<br/>Because of that, Downes says, they didn't see the need to put up much of a fight this time. \"You'll have noted that their voices were extremely muted during this whole proceeding,\" Downes says. \"They said very little themselves. They didn't even say that much through their trade associations.\"<br/>To be sure, tech companies did voice their displeasure with the outcome of last week's vote. Amazon's CTO       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/Werner/status/941393285766983680\">tweeted</url> that he was \"extremely disappointed.\" Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/14/technology/business/fcc-net-neutrality-reactions/index.html\">said</url> the decision was \"disappointing and harmful.\" Microsoft's chief legal officer       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/941388055067295744\">tweeted</url> that repealing net neutrality will hurt \"consumers, business &amp;amp; the entire economy.\"<br/>Of the tech companies named in this article, only Netflix and Google provided responses to a request for comment. \"We've actually been pretty vocal,\" said Bao-Viet Nguyen, a Netflix spokesperson, pointing to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/netflix/status/933042368156123136\">pro-net-neutrality</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/netflix/status/885164545676726272?lang=en\">tweets</url> sent out from the company's account and the public comments       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/107171642618256/Netflix%20NN%20comments%20WC%20Dkt%2007-108%20filed%207.17.17.pdf\">it filed with the FCC</url>. Nguyen added, \"Although there are other companies for whom this is a bigger business issue today, we continue to support net neutrality protections so that the next Netflix has a fair shot.\" And Scott Haber, a spokesperson for the Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Google, and Amazon (as well as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://internetassociation.org/our-members/\">a number of other big tech companies</url>), said that the organization had \"been incredibly active on behalf of our members\" in trying to preserve net neutrality, issuing statements and publishing white papers on the subject.<br/>Still, it is one thing to put out tweets and press releases, and quite another to be dogging the FCC for months about an upcoming vote. One reading of those post-FCC-vote laments from tech executives is that these companies see       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/patagonia-rei-bears-ears-president-stole/547577/?utm_source=feed\">public-relations value</url> in associating themselves with egalitarian digital ideals; another is that they are well aware that their employees care deeply about net neutrality as a political issue, even if it doesn't threaten any bottom lines.<br/>Indeed, when I asked Larry Downes how big tech firms might recalibrate their business strategies after last week's vote, he warned me, \"This is going to be very boring.\" Ryan Singel, a fellow at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society and a former reporter at Wired, agrees that it's hard to imagine the Googles and Facebooks of the world doing things differently after net neutrality's repeal. \"These guys can afford to pay for fast lanes\"-the priority treatment that ISPs will soon be permitted to charge for-\"they can afford to pay access fees, they have the clout to make sure that when they do pay for those, that they get a better rate than someone else,\" Singel says. He remembers when, roughly a decade ago, Google strongly advocated for having net-neutrality-like rules       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrydownes/2011/09/26/the-true-cost-of-net-neutrality/2/#7600baef7e17\">govern the FCC's auction of a newly available segment of the radio spectrum</url>. This time around, he says, \"Google was nowhere near the level of fight they put up in 2008, 2009, 2010.\" (For Google's part, a company spokesperson told me that it \"remain[s] committed\" to net neutrality and \"will work with other net neutrality supporters large and small to promote strong, enforceable protections.\")<br/>One thing that last week's repeal could change, though, is the market for distributing content. These two markets have each become heavily consolidated-in both cases, a small number of large companies dominate-and there's a concern that lifting net-neutrality protections would only speed up this process. Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, an antitrust research group, says that he expects last week's vote to \"accelerate the contest for the last monopoly standing,\" because it enables ISPs to push for deals that large tech and media companies are best positioned to enter into. \"There will still be competition,\" he added, \"but it will be competition among the telecom and big tech platforms over who controls access to customers and monopoly power.\"<br/>And because the repeal of net neutrality increases the upsides of being big, Stoller says, more companies will try to get bigger, which could speed up the race for lucrative business deals at the expense of product innovation. This is the race that led AT&amp;amp;T (a content-distribution company) to want to buy Time Warner (a content company) and Verizon (a content-distribution company) to want to buy Yahoo and AOL (both content companies). Stoller says he expects that last week's vote will prompt similar companies to consider such deals of their own-perhaps a tech platform would even think about buying a telecom.<br/>When it comes to large companies gaining power, the flip-side concern is about smaller companies losing it. Net neutrality's proponents fear, among other things, that an internet with \"fast lanes\" will squeeze out smaller firms that don't have the funds or negotiating power that large tech companies can use to push back against ISPs. \"It's the smaller retailers ... that are going to feel more of that pain,\" says Singel, adding, \"Openness is the tool of insurgents.\" Indeed, it was smaller companies that were most vocal leading up to last week's vote, which makes sense: Some of yesterday's voluble insurgents are today's quiet behemoths.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-netflixgooglenetneutrality548768</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8J-1G61-DYY9-J1KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1365\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Industrial automation\u2014the turning over of manual and mechanical processes to self-acting and self-regulating machines\u2014has been going on in one form or another for over 200 years, driven by the industrialist's idea of nirvana: a factory where machines do all the work, and do it more efficiently and with greater precision than humans ever could. These machines are never late for work, they never complain about coworkers, nor do they quit on short notice when another employer dangles a 50-cent-per-hour raise in their face.</p><p><br/> But there is, of course, another point of view, one that is charged with pathos and compassion. Automation comes at the cost of real jobs to real people. And if too much automation comes too fast, it can ignite social unrest.<br/> However, ultimately progress must prevail. Dislocation is an unfortunate consequence, but humans are remarkably adaptable, and over the long run technology eventually elevates the quality of life for everyone.<br/> And so, while the industrial dreamland has yet to be fully realized, considerable progress has been made toward that end. While manufacturing jobs in the US declined from a peak of 20 million in 1979 to under 12 million in 2010, manufacturing output almost doubled in the same time period.<br/><br/>And output per worker has tripled!<br/><br/>That's called efficiency, and most of it was the result of automation.<br/> There is evidence of intensive industrial automation in other parts of the world as well. The Republic of Korea and Japan\u2014the two most automated countries in the world\u2014each have about 350 industrial robots per 10,000 manufacturing employees. Germany has 250 robots per 10,000 employees, while Italy, Sweden, and Denmark each have about 150.<br/> But what about the country where the majority of the world's manufacturing takes place? Well, its robot revolution is just starting to take shape.<br/> Over the last decade, China's economic growth has been fueled to a great extent by cheap human labor. However, China's well of cheap labor, which at one time seemed limitless, looks to be drying up.<br/> Economists at the International Monetary Fund predict that sometime between 2020 and 2025, China will hit the Lewis turning point, a concept put forth by Nobel prize-winning economist Arthur Lewis in 1954 as part of his broader theory on economic development.<br/> According to Lewis, when a developing economy begins to industrialize, it uses imported technology and capital and cheap labor from its agricultural sector. These laborers accept what those in developed economies consider to be low wages\u2014but to them, accustomed as they are to subsistence farming, those wages are ample. Cheap labor becomes the economy's competitive advantage, and rapid growth ensues.<br/> However, over time, the extra agriculture labor is put to work, wages begin to rise, the competitive advantage begins to erode, and companies in the economy become less profitable. At that inflection point\u2014the Lewis turning point\u2014the economy must automate in order to keep growing.<br/> Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and others have traveled down this road, and China is heading down the same route. In China's case, the primary reason for increasing wages is not an increasing demand for labor, but rather a decreasing supply of labor.<br/> In 1979, the Chinese government enacted the one-child policy, which has created a demographic shift to a more aged population.<br/><br/>The policy has had the effect of gradually reducing the growth of the workforce over the last 30 years. As you can see in the chart below, that growth rate is currently about 5%, but will turn negative sometime between 2020 and 2025 as retirees begin to outnumber new workers.<br/><br/>In addition to the effects of demographics on the supply and therefore the cost of labor, the Chinese government has set a target of 13% for annual increases in the minimum wage through 2015. All this suggests that year-over-year increases in China's hourly manufacturing labor costs will continue to be at least as high as the roughly 15% average experienced over the 10-year period of 2003-2012.<br/> Already, export customers are beginning to take notice of the detrimental effects of wage inflation on the cost of Chinese products. What to do? Well, if history is any guide, Chinese manufacturers will automate.<br/> Using robot density (industrial robots in use per 10,000 manufacturing employees) as a proxy for overall industrial automation, we can see in the table below that once Japan, Korea, and Taiwan achieved baseline densities of 5 to 10 (similar to China's current density of 7), compounded annual growth was a torrid 26% to 45% for the next 5 years, and 20% to 33% for the next 10 years.<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/> Will China follow a similar growth trajectory? The BIG TECH[1] team thinks so\u2026 and we have identified a company that will ride this wave of growth. The best part is that our automation company is involved other promising markets. In fact, this company's patented technology makes it a key player in the mobile-device boom. Opportunities like this don't come around too often\u2014and when they do, they don't last long.

Here\u2019s what the top candidates have said so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elizabeth Warren</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Massachusetts senator is leading the charge for aggressive action against the tech industry, a position she staked out on Medium in March. Warren is keen to break up Amazon, Facebook, and Google, which she calls \u201cplatform utilities\u201d (Apple would seem to qualify too). Among the competition, Warren\u2019s plan is the boldest and the most openly hostile to tech giants.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\u201d Warren writes. \u201cThey\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\u201d</p><p>Her plan, which calls for unwinding many of these companies\u2019 crucial acquisitions, is both the most ambitious and the most difficult to imagine in practical terms. In Warren\u2019s tech industry, Amazon would lose Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook would defriend WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google would say goodbye to Waze and Nest.</p><p>\u201cSo the way I understand this is there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country,\u201d Warren said at Wednesday\u2019s debate. \u201cWhere I want to start this is I want to return government to the people, and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying I have the courage to go after them.\u201d</p><p>Bernie Sanders</p><p>Sanders hasn\u2019t gone in on tech quite like Warren has, but given their ideological overlap he likely isn\u2019t far behind. The Vermont senator has not directly called for the breakup of tech companies, though he has stated \u201cwe should definitely take a look\u201d at doing so. \u201cI worry very much about monopolistic tendencies in many sectors of our economy, including high tech,\u201d Sanders said in May. \u201cI think we have to take a really hard look at the degree to which monopolization in all aspects of our economy are a threat to the American people.\u201d</p><p>As in 2016, the senator still saves most of his ire for Wall Street, but some of his policies targeting the financial industry could make big waves in tech too. Sanders\u2019 proposal for his Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act could affect major tech companies that use foreign cash holdings to dodge domestic corporate taxes, though some notorious cash-stashers like Apple already committed to bringing home overseas wealth with the blessing of President Trump\u2019s one-time, reduced rate repatriation offer.</p><p>Sanders takes a particular interest in Amazon, both for alarming reports about worker conditions and for the fact the second most valuable public company in the world doesn\u2019t pay anything in taxes. Sanders also praised an op-ed by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes calling for the breakup of the company.</p><p>\u201cAmazon, Netflix and dozens of major corporations, as a result of Trump\u2019s tax bill, pay nothing in federal taxes. I think that\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Sanders said during the Fox town hall earlier this year.</p><p>Joe Biden</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Biden\u2019s view on the tech industry falls more toward the middle. Although the former vice president has praised Warren\u2019s proposal to break up internet giants, saying she makes a \u201cstrong case,\u201d he\u2019s generally spoken in more exploratory rather than decisive terms on the issue. In May, Biden told the Associated Press that breaking up companies like Facebook is \u201csomething we should take a really hard look at\u201d but stopped short of specifics.</p><p>While Biden isn\u2019t ready to say where he stands on breaking up Big Tech, he\u2019s carved out a middle ground by making his views on Amazon\u2019s tax status well known. That position, shared by many 2020 candidates, could hold massive tech companies accountable for paying more on the wealth they generate if the corporate tax code gets a less Big Tech-friendly overhaul.</p><p>Pete Buttigieg </p><p>Indiana might be a world away from Silicon Valley, but next to Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, Buttigieg boasts some of the closest connections to tech. His donor list during the DNC chair race included tech A-listers like Y Combinator chairman Sam Altman, Dropbox founder Drew Houston, and Facebook\u2019s Chris Cox.</p><p>Buttigieg dabbles in a few schools of thought on tech regulation. When asked directly if he agreed with Warren\u2019s hardline plan during a town hall, he answered \u201cpotentially.\u201d Unlike anti-monopolist crusaders like Sanders, Buttigieg sees tech companies\u2019 behavior\u2014not their size\u2014as the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s not how big they are, it\u2019s how they act,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing I think we need to be regulating and targeting most.\u201d</p><p>Buttigieg wants to punt that action to the FTC, a sentiment echoed by former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke. The South Bend mayor is also focused on the user privacy angle, pointing to Europe\u2019s GDPR as a framework.</p><p>\u201cThe U.S. lacks a national data policy that clarifies these things,\u201d Buttigieg said in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix that.\u201d</p><p>Kamala Harris</p><p>San Francisco might be her home turf, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the city\u2019s former district attorney from looking critically at the Bay Area\u2019s outsize influence on society. In May, Harris framed her perspective that tech platforms are utilities in an interview with CNN.</p><p>\u201cWhen you look at the issue, they\u2019re essentially a utility,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThere are very few people that can actually get by, and be involved in their communities and society, or in whatever their profession, without somehow, somewhere using Facebook. It\u2019s very difficult for people to be engaged in any level of commerce without it. So, we have to recognize it for what it is: It is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s got to stop.\u201d</p><p>The senator echoed Biden\u2019s more moderate stance on the issue of breaking up companies like Facebook, saying \u201cwe need to seriously take a look\u201d at the possibility of doing so. That language stops short of stronger positions from candidates like Warren.</p><p>Beto O\u2019Rourke</p><p>Many candidates can\u2019t quite say what they mean when it comes to tech, but the former member of Congress from Texas didn\u2019t shy away from expressing his dissenting view, even if he hasn\u2019t cared to elaborate much.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to do more to ensure dynamism in our economy and address corporate concentration,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told Business Insider in April. \u201cI don\u2019t know that breaking up Amazon is the way to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there needs to be further reviews of mergers and acquisitions not just at the highest levels, but sometimes at some of the lower levels that sort of escape the attention or the radar of the FTC,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if having five more Facebooks, if you broke up Facebook into five component parts, or any of these other large social media companies, makes as much sense as regulating them,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said earlier this year.</p><p>The Texan hasn\u2019t deviated from his view that tech regulation doesn\u2019t need to be heavy-handed and appears to align with Harris on the idea that tech platforms could be treated more like utilities.</p><p>Cory Booker</p><p>As a Stanford grad and one of the candidates coziest with Silicon Valley, Booker is proceeding with caution on issues that could roil the tech industry.</p><p>Booker came out with some strong language for tech platforms in April, though he seemed to walk it back a bit in later remarks. During Thursday\u2019s debate, Booker was asked how his own views measure up with Warren\u2019s on the issue of tech regulation. Executing a familiar maneuver, he quickly steered the conversation toward a broad condemnation of \u201ccorporate consolidation\u201d and away from specific ills wrought by the tech sector:</p><p>\u201dI will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. And when it comes to antitrust law, what I would do is number one, appoint judges that will enforce it; number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration. At the end of the day we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing.\u201d</p><p>Booker has maintained this approach since at least 2017, when he condemned \u201cmassive consolidation\u201d across industries while declining to single tech out. Since then, he\u2019s occasionally gone more on the attack while still expressing far more caution than some of his peers.</p><p>Still, Booker doesn\u2019t appear to endorse the idea of breaking up tech giants. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying break them up without any kind of process here,\u201d Booker told ABC\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This Week</emphasis> in May. \u201cIt\u2019s not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to break up you guys.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The Rest</p><p>A few candidates toward the bottom of the polls have tried to make a splash with their regulatory views. Next to Warren, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) has issued the most full-throated call to break up Big Tech.</p><p>Andrew Yang doesn\u2019t view breaking up companies like Facebook as the right solution, though he has called attention to social media\u2019s systemic effects on children\u2019s health and behavior. The former tech entrepreneur proposes a federal department that \u201cfocuses specifically on smartphones and social media, gaming and chat apps,\u201d noting that he\u2019d appoint prominent tech ethicist and former Googler Tristan Harris to run it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2250818368</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGH-5CJ1-DY0W-44P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1583\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The first is the FinTech camp. This camp sit around the campfire and go 'down with banks, down with banks'. They believe banks are out-dated legacy firms who have no idea about the modern age of technology. </p><p>They believe banks are money-grabbing Shylocks, purely trying to steal the cash out of our pockets. They believe that banks can be destroyed by start-ups and are actively trying to replace them. A second camp are the big technology firms. The GAFAs, FANGs, FATBAGs or whatever you call them. They have the Jeff Bezos, Pony Ma and Mark Zuckerberg around their fire. They're looking at the banks and wondering about them. On the one hand banks are the biggest users of their cloud services and the biggest spenders on their advertising; on the other, their services are weak, and they are tempted to offer alternatives. Hmmmm. What to do, what to do. A third camp don't care about the banks at all. They ignore them. They focus upon the technology and what technology can do. They believe technology is incredible and can change the world, not just for shopping but for everything. They are building new ideas with new technologies to create new financial services. They don't even look at the banks. Their brethren include M-PESA, Ant Financial and Trov. The fourth camp are the banks. They have the biggest campfire. In fact, theirs is not a fire, but a furnace. They sit around their furnace and burn. They know no-one likes them but, when people gather around their heat, they find it's actually rather nice. It's warm and cosy and they offer anyone the chance to toast a marshmallow. Unlike the impression that everyone has outside the banks, when they gather around their fire, they find they're actually quite friendly. Finally, there's the regulators. Their campfire is a fridge. It's pretty cold. They are trying to start the fire, and some have a few embers burning, but they find it hard as so many people tell them that their fire is cold. They are shivering. They're trying to warm up. In the evening, the people turn up on the beach and see the fires burning. They look around and immediately walk towards the furnace. It's the largest heat and, in the evening, that's what they want. The problem is the crowd gets too big, so some people start wandering around, looking at the other camps to see if there's anything better or friendlier. Most of them end up in the second camp, with the big tech companies. However, those firms do not try to steal them away from the furnace. They share their space. Meantime, the loneliest space is the camp with the coldest fire. Do you ever feel sorry for the regulator? Brrrrrr. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-FSCB1079981552548958845251762500201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCB-6705</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMT-NVW1-F03R-N377-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><timeReceived>7:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Finanser by Chris Skinner</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Grid</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Digital Bank</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>PE0009VUU</classCode><className>JEFFREY P BEZOS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>PE000C5PB</classCode><className>MARK ZUCKERBERG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Unfortunately, very few of us thought about that until it was too late and that data was already being used in ways we couldn't have imagined. Even now, after all of the controversies and headlines, there's still a lot we don't know about how the likes of Google, Facebook[2] and the rest use the data that we've given them over the years. Something that has changed is that they now publish transparency reports, which provide information about countries that have requested data from them and how times they complied with those data requests. </p><p> Get Our Activist Investing Case Study!

Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[3] However, the existence of these reports doesn't mean that we've actually read them, so most of us are still none the wiser about how our data is being given out and to whom.

These maps show where each of these ten big technology[5] companies sent user data in response to government requests, based on their most recent transparency reports. From them you can get a better idea of where you data is most likely to be given away and in which country it's most likely to be given to. So, if you live in the United States of America, you'll be at the top of the list for all of these companies, but you can also see who has been sending data all around the world, with Facebook and Apple's maps particularly busy, and Google not far behind.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/11_Tech-companies-transparency-reports-2019.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/11_Tech-companies-transparency-reports-2019.png</url> Which companies are sending the most data? While those maps are certainly a great way to visualize where the data has been flowing, these charts offer a clearer picture of how many requests each of the tech giants received and also how many of those requests were granted. So, while Facebook[6] is clearly the company that sent the most user data[7], it also received a lot more requests than it granted. Google[8] and Apple are the next biggest, but the second chart is particularly interesting as it shows the percentage of requests that were granted, with Apple and Snapchat the two most likely to send your data. Meanwhile, the likes of Twitter and WordPress only grant just over 50% of requests and Airbnb only granted around 33%.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/12_Percentage-user-data-requests-granted-by-tech-companies.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/12_Percentage-user-data-requests-granted-by-tech-companies.png</url> Which countries are requiring the most data requests? If you've seen any of the other images so far, you'll probably have guessed that the United States of America will be the country that has requested the most data, but even so, the incredible distance by which it leads all of the other countries is really illustrated here. With over 150,000 requests, it has well over twice as many requests as second-placed Germany[9], while the likes of India, the UK and France trailing even further behind. What is interesting to compare here is which companies dominate each bar, with Facebook making up a large chunk of the US requests, while Apple is the biggest for Germany.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/13_Top-20-countries-requesting-data-from-tech-giants-2019.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/13_Top-20-countries-requesting-data-from-tech-giants-2019.png</url> Which continents have the most data requests? With the USA's huge dominance of the data requests globally, it's no big shock to see that North America is also the continent with the most requests, but as the previous chart showed, many of the other biggest requesters of data came from Europe[10]. They may only add up to 144, 453 requests, which is fewer than the USA on its own, but it's still interesting to see the spread of requests across Europe.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/14_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-Europe.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/14_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-Europe.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/15_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-Asia.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/15_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-Asia.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/16_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-North-America.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/16_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-North-America.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/17_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-South-America.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/17_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-South-America.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/18_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-Oceania.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/18_Which-countries-want-your-data-in-Oceania.png</url> How have data requests changed over the years? It might be strange to think that these tech giants are still so comparatively new, but this chart shows exactly how long they have been receiving data requests. Even as recently as 2010, there were a fraction of the number of requests, before things exploded into life in 2013 with many more requests for Facebook and Apple[11] joining Google. Interestingly, while the chart shows dramatic growth every year after that, there was actually a drop in 2018, presumably because of an increase in data protection laws causing both governments and companies to be more cautious about what requests are made and granted. Whether that continues remains to be seen.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/19_User-data-information-requests-2010-2018.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/19_User-data-information-requests-2010-2018.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20_How-the-USA-compares-tech-giants-transparency-reports.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20_How-the-USA-compares-tech-giants-transparency-reports.png</url> The USA vs Rest of the World We've mentioned the United States[12] and its dominance of the data requests charts. Whether that comes down to political factors or the reality that these companies originated in the USA and became well established there before spreading around the world, it's hard to say for sure. What can be seen in this chart is how disproportionately it features every year compared to the number of requests coming from the rest of the world. So what does the future hold for how our data gets used? Scandals like the Cambridge Analytica saga have made us all much more aware of how the data we give to social media and tech giants can be used without our knowledge, but that hasn't stopped us using them. Will increased regulations protect our privacy with regards to data requests or has the horse already bolted? Only time will tell, but it will be very interesting to see how charts like these[13] develop in years to come.

The heads of the intelligence agencies - the FBI and the Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security - joined together to affirm that Russia, China, Iran and other enemies of the United States will seek to interfere in the 2020 election. And with a year before the vote, Congress has done little to act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the first time in American history, social media is an election issue. Its influence on our democratic process was thrust into the spotlight after Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election exploded into public consciousness, followed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a parade of data breaches, privacy concerns and ongoing manipulative business and advertising practices that leave American discourse more vulnerable than ever before.</p><p>As Twitter and Facebook hash out their political ad policies ahead of the 2020 vote, Democratic presidential candidates have seized on the issue. Most of the candidates have dealt in platitudes and left it at that: Do they support \"breaking up\" Big Tech? Would they encourage President Trump's expulsion from Twitter?</p><p>Yet there is one who has championed a more nuanced approach to social media policy: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn).</p><p>Klobuchar is a co-sponsor of the Honest Ads Act, a pragmatic bill that, if passed, could begin a real discussion of social media regulation and its role in our fight against online influence campaigns. The legislation would require disclosure on online political ads so that voters can understand who is targeting them, why they were targeted and how much an advertiser spent to do so.</p><p>The bill has bipartisan support; its first incarnation was co-sponsored with Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and the late John McCain (R-Ariz.). This year, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) joined Klobuchar and Warner. Despite this bipartisanship, and despite passing in the House as part of the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act , the bill has never received so much as a markup in the Rules Committee. Along with a group of other bills that aim to update voting infrastructure and otherwise protect the democratic process, it is currently trapped in legislative purgatory.</p><p>Congressional inaction on Honest Ads is even more inexplicable given that social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, have begun to voluntarily comply with portions of the bill. They could - as Honest Ads would require them to - go farther. Facebook's ad library, for instance, reveals only the ages, genders and geographical data of those targeted by political advertisers, though its platform is capable of targeting at a much more granular level. It's this information - whether users were targeted by interest or affinity groups, for example - that would be most useful for researchers identifying disinformation campaigns, which typically exploit societal fissures. The passage of Honest Ads into law would hold social media companies and advertisers accountable for lax enforcement or for skirting the rules. It would also act as a deterrent. Currently, Congress can only send sternly worded letters to social media platforms when they slip up. That does little to encourage compliance - and even less to deter foreign interference.</p><p>Advertising transparency is only part of the solution to the problem of online influence, however, and Klobuchar recognizes that. She has introduced legislation to protect users' privacy online and obtain their informed consent for the use of their data, allowing them to opt out of targeted advertising. She has worked to ensure that online disinformation does not lead to voter suppression. And given that the most successful Russian content in 2016 was amplified organically, without the purchase of a single ad, she is leading a push to empower American citizens through digital citizenship and media literacy programs in schools, thus helping future generations to act more quickly to recognize the tactics of online manipulation.</p><p>None of these bills have been passed, or even made it out of committee. As for Honest Ads, Klobuchar pleaded with her fellow senators for unanimous consent on the bill in October. Online political advertising has \"no rules of the road,\" she told the Senate. \"It is not only unfair, but it is criminal if this continues. It is so easy to do. This is something we could fix right away.\"</p><p>Her motion was denied. The bill, like its siblings, languishes in committee. Klobuchar's nuanced, common-sense proposals are aired only in 90-second, general talking points on the Democratic debate stage, almost invariably overpowered by bolder pronouncements. It's America's loss. Where we ought to be leading on addressing disinformation, we are lagging. Addressing online influence campaigns shouldn't be an issue that concerns only the Democratic Party, but democracy overall.</p><p>             Read more:</p><p>             Emerson T.

Yet its people are not any healthier. Where does all the money go? One explanation is waste, with patients wolfing down too many pills and administrators churning out red tape. There is also the cost of services that may be popular and legitimate but do nothing to improve medical outcomes. Manhattan's hospitals, with their swish reception desks and menus, can seem like hotels compared with London's bleached Victorian structures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The most controversial source of excess spending, though, is rent-seeking by health-care firms. This is when companies extract outsize profits relative to the capital they deploy and risks they take. Schumpeter has estimated the scale of gouging across the health-care system. Although it does not explain the vast bulk of America's overspending, the sums are big by any other standard, with health-care firms making excess profits of $65bn a year. Surprisingly, the worst offenders are not pharmaceutical firms but an army of corporate health-care middlemen.</p><p>In crude terms, the health-care labyrinth comprises six layers, each involving the state, mutual organisations and private firms. People and employers pay insurance companies, which pay opaque aggregators known as pharmacy-benefit managers and preferred provider organisers. They in turn pay doctors, hospitals and pharmacies, which in turn pay wholesalers, who pay the manufacturers of equipment and drugs. Some conglomerates span several layers. For example on March 8th Cigna, an insurance firm, bid $67bn for Express Scripts, a benefit manager. A system of rebates means money flows in both directions so that the real price of products and services (net of rebates) is obscured.</p><p>To work out who is stiffing whom, Schumpeter has examined the top 200 American listed health-care firms. Excess profits are calculated as those earned above a 10% return on capital (excluding goodwill), a yardstick of the maximum that should be possible in any perfectly competitive industry. For drugmakers the figures treat research and development (R&amp;D) as an asset that is depreciated over 15 years, roughly the period they have to exploit patents on discoveries. The data are from Bloomberg.</p><p>Total excess profits amount to only about 4% of America's health-care overspending. But this still makes health care the second biggest of the giant rent-seeking industries that have come to dominate parts of the economy. The excess profits of the health-care firms are equivalent to $200 per American per year, compared with $69 for the telecoms and cable TV industry and $25 captured by the airline oligopoly. Only the five big tech \"platform\" firms, with a figure of $250, are more brazen gougers.</p><p>Everyone hates pharmaceutical firms, but their share of health-care rent-seeking is relatively trivial, especially once you include the many midsized and small firms that are investing heavily. Across the economy, average prices received by drug manufacturers have risen by about 5% per year, net of the rebates. But their costs have risen, too. As a result, even for the 15 biggest global drugs firms, returns on capital have halved since the glory days of the late 1990s, and are now barely above the cost of capital. As employer schemes get stingier, employees are being forced to pay more of their drug costs; they are price-conscious.</p><p>Meanwhile the effectiveness of R&amp;D seems to have fallen. Richard Evans of SSR, a research firm, tracks the number of high-quality patents (defined as those cited in other patent applications) that drug firms generate per dollar of R&amp;D. This metric has dropped sharply over the past decade. Shareholders may groan, but for the economy overall the system seems to be working. Big pharma is still splurging on R&amp;D but not making out like a bandit.</p><p>As the drug industry has come back down to earth, the returns of the 46 middlemen on the list have soared. Fifteen years ago they accounted for a fifth of industry profits; now their share is 41%. Health-insurance companies generate abnormally high returns, but so do the wholesalers, the benefit managers and the pharmacies. In total middlemen capture $126 of excess profits a year per American, or about two-thirds of the whole industry's excess profits. Express Scripts earns billions while having less than $1bn of physical plants and no disclosed investment in R&amp;D. This year the combined profits of three wholesalers that few outsiders have heard of are expected to exceed those of Starbucks.</p><p>The dark view is that pockets of rent-seeking have become endemic in America's economy. Wherever products are too complex for customers to understand, and where subsidies and complex regulation add to the muddle, huge profits can opaquely be made. Remember mortgage-backed securities?</p><p>In the case of health care, consolidation has probably made things worse by muting competition. There are now five big insurance companies, three big wholesalers, three large pharmacy chains and three big benefit managers. The current vogue is for \"vertical mergers\" in which firms expand into different layers. As well as Cigna and Express Scripts, Aetna, another insurer, and CVS, a pharmacy and benefits manager, are merging. All these firms insist competition will be boosted. But they are also projecting the deals will boost their combined profits by $1.4bn.</p><p>Yet perhaps capitalism is not broken and new contenders will eventually be tempted in. Amazon has acquired wholesale pharmacy licences in multiple states. It is also teaming up with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to create a new health system for their staff. These initiatives are at an early stage, but investors are sufficiently worried that they value the intermediaries on abnormally low multiples of profits, suggesting earnings may fall. People often get upset when conventional industries are hit by digital competition.

If anything, the lockdown has made us more reliant on them rather than less. </p><p>Sean Markowicz, a strategist at Schroders explains: 'Microsoft has reported a surge in usage of its cloud computing service Azure, as millions of people work from home.'</p><p>'Amazon is hiring an additional 75,000 workers, on top of the 100,000 it hired last month, to cope with increased demand for its online delivery service.'</p><p>'The number of video calls and messaging on Facebook has exploded, while a record number of gaming apps were downloaded in China on Apple's app store. YouTube Kids, owned by Google, was the most streamed app in the first quarter of 2020 according to a report by Apptopia and Braze, following the closure of most nurseries and schools,' he continued. </p><p>'Unsurprisingly, the FAMAG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Google - have significantly outperformed broader market indices as a result of stay-at-home orders,' Markowicz said. </p><p>'The more common FAANG acronym includes Netflix but not Microsoft. We use an alternative grouping because Microsoft is the most valuable public US company - the total value of its shares makes it seven times larger than Netflix.'</p><p>Markowicz also pointed out that these companies have accrued vast piles of cash over the years which leaves them more than capable of riding out even a severe recession.</p><p>                     Is the Fomo rally the real deal or will shares dive again?                    </p><p>It's been called the Fomo rally, as shares picked themselves up off the floor after a diabolical March and bear markets turned bullish.</p><p>The FTSE 100 bounced 23 per cent with theUK in lockdown. In the US, April was even more astonishing - the S&amp;P 500 had its best month since 1987.</p><p>So, what's going on? Is this the stock market signalling the start of a coronavirus recovery, or have investors merely been piling in driven by Fomo - the fear of missing out?</p><p>On this podcast, we look at the rally, what's driving it and the history of false dawns in stock market crashes. </p><p> Press play above or listen (and please subscribe if you like the podcast) at Apple Podcasts, Acast, Spotify and Audioboom or visit our This is Money Podcast page. </p><p>So buying tech shares is a complete no-brainer right? Not necessarily. </p><p>A global recession does have implications for them and you could make the argument all the good news and resilience is already priced in.</p><p>The fact is, that if people around the world have less money to spend overall as is the case in a recession, tech firms will feel that in their earnings to some degree over time.</p><p>As well as direct to customer sales potentiality slowing, the likes of Google and Facebook can also take a hit from the inevitable advertising drop-off that comes with a recession. Whether these things will be enough to seriously hurt the share price is questionable though.</p><p>The real major risk area for big tech stocks is governments intervening to break them up or restrict their market power in other ways. This is something which is growing increasingly likely. </p><p>There is also always a possibility of them being hit with huge fines if deemed to have behaved in anti-competitive or reckless ways by regulators.</p><p>'Over the past 18 months, the FAMAGs have already faced a barrage of criticism over their anticompetitive behaviour,' noted Markowicz. 'The bigger tech becomes, the more likely they will become more heavily regulated. History is replete with such examples. At some point, this could have serious implications for their growth prospects.</p><p>'With a number of governments turning to tech companies to help manage the virus outbreak, one possibility is that the major digital platforms could become regulated like public utilities given their increasing size and influence.'</p><p>'In the past, governments did not hesitate to regulate services that were deemed essential public goods such as railways and energy suppliers. New regulations could be imposed that limit how these firms monetise data and which markets they can participate in.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-62602230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT9-5181-F021-602W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><timeReceived>10:55 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

as it occurred on Twitter (that's a few clicks to the left on the dial, Senator.)</p><p>The senators' fiery questions were put to much better use when they focused on the real matter at hand, of how big tech companies are able to bully out competitors, price out others and change their own rules to suit themselves.</p><p>During the session all four of the CEOs managed to look shifty, disingenuous and dubiously clueless about the activity of their own operations on occasion.</p><p>The weight of perjury clearly weighed on their minds in the more PR-damaging moments, resulting in plenty of \"I'll have to get back to you about that, congresswoman\" moments, but the frustratingly short timeframes for each period of questions meant issues were often dodged or only addressed superficially.</p><p>Occasionally the CEOs popped back up to clarify their earlier answers, after presumably being alerted off-camera that their claims to be unaware of events could be proven false.</p><p>For example, Mr Pichai initially claimed not to be aware of any evidence that China steals US technology ideas, before returning to clarify that Google had suffered a cyber attack from the country in 2009.</p><p>More notably to the point of business practices, Mr Zuckerberg initially claimed to have no knowledge of a controversy last year in which the company was busted using an app called Onavo to track teenagers' internet use, before recreating it as a Facebook \"research\" app that it paid teenagers to use, while secretly tracking them.</p><p>He set the record straight later in the session with some cock and bull about being initially confused by the name of the app referred to in the senator's question.</p><p>Mr Bezos was particularly unconvincing in answering questions about whether Amazon accessed and used third-party seller data in order to beat them with its own products, and whether its Amazon Web Services division ripped off apps created and distributed by other companies through its platforms. Bizarrely, he couldn't even say with any degree of conviction whether Amazon actively prevented stolen goods from being sold on its site.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg, meanwhile, was hard to believe when explaining away his own emails talking about buying rivals such as Instagram to reduce competitive threats, by saying the app may not have become popular anyway.</p><p>Mr Cook floundered when confronted with examples of Apple banning rivals to its own parental control app from its App Store, and using its heft to make other major companies use its platforms.</p><p>Emails from its senior VP of software and services Eddy Cue showed it rejected e-book apps from publisher Random House in order to force it to join its own e-book marketplace, and that it had also considered raising the already eye-watering 30 per cent cut it takes from app developers' sales in their first year to avoid \"leaving money on the table\".</p><p>\"Maybe the [Random House] app didn't work right,\" was Mr Cook's weak retort.</p><p>Google has been accused of killing advertising tech rivals such as Australia's Unlockd by excluding their apps from its app store, but Mr Pichai was nailed here for his empty expressions of concern about the future of journalism and media, while Google increasingly directs advertising revenue to its own services, via its own marketplace.</p><p>\"These companies, as they exist today, all have monopoly power ... Some need to be broken up,\" chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust David Cicilline said at the conclusion of the hearings.</p><p>After a compelling yet ultimately frustrating session, that will all depend on how hard the regulators are able to push this amid a pandemic-shrouded election campaign.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520307630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GX-TR81-DY19-C07N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><timeReceived>05:58 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

However, it's kind of weird to see a couple of laid off journalists announce a project to \"protect\" journalism that seems to consist entirely of whining about big tech[2]. It's literally called the \"Save Journalism Project\" but they have no plans to actually \"save journalism.\"Their new project will be set up as a nonprofit, according to Eddie Vale, a Democratic consultant whose firm is helping launch the effort. Vale pitched Bassett on the idea, and the two of them brought in Stanton. </p><p>Vale said initial funding had been secured from 'someone who doesn't want to be public so Google and Facebook don't go after them,' and the group plans to continue to fundraise. So far, the pair have coauthored testimony given to the Senate Judiciary Committee highlighting the tech giants' impact on the news industry \u2014 'since being laid off, we've made it our mission to understand how the digital marketplace works and how Big Tech is killing the journalism industry,' they wrote[3] \u2014 flown a plane above Google's I/O conference, and authored op-eds.Wow. Flying a plane over a Google conference. That'll save journalism.At the moment, Stanton and Bassett are more focused on warning the public and the industry about the issue than on proposing solutions. 'I do think that everyone is starting to see a need to break up and regulate these companies or something along those lines,' Bassett said. 'And with regards to how they're going to make journalism viable again, I don't frankly know...I think right now we're starting with just getting this conversation out into the public and making people aware of exactly what's going on. I do hope at some point we graduate into saying, 'here's a list of policy proposals, here's exactly what needs to happen.''Even if you believe the (debatable) claim that Google and Facebook are somehow to blame for the decline in advertising revenue to news sites, I'm left scratching my head over what good complaining about big tech actually does. Also \"break up and regulate or something along those lines\"? Again, I think there's a valuable discussion to be had about how best to help fund journalism. It is pretty damn key to my own livelihood. But, this organization isn't set up to have an \"open\" discussion. It has already insisted what the problem is (\"big tech\") without being able to support that argument, and then says \"something must be done\" and so far it's just whining about big tech. I fail to see how that's productive. There are lots of smart, thoughtful people who have put a lot of work into a variety of arguments about how to deal with the big internet companies. Some of them I agree with and some of them I don't, but I'm at a near total loss as to how merely whining does anything at all to save journalism.Permalink[4] | Comments[5] | Email This Story[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190530/10330742303/new-study-shows-that-all-this-ad-targeting-doesnt-work-that-well.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190530/10330742303/new-study-shows-that-all-this-ad-targeting-doesnt-work-that-well.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosiegray/media-tech-facebook-layoffs-google\">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosiegray/media-tech-facebook-layoffs-google</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/save-journalism/written-statement-for-the-record-by-laura-bassett-and-john-stanton-for-a-hearing-before-the-senate-d54c5ca9b65a\">https://medium.com/save-journalism/written-statement-for-the-record-by-laura-bassett-and-john-stanton-for-a-hearing-before-the-senate-d54c5ca9b65a</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190606/16115942347/whining-about-big-tech-doesnt-protect-journalism.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190606/16115942347/whining-about-big-tech-doesnt-protect-journalism.shtml</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190606/16115942347/whining-about-big-tech-doesnt-protect-journalism.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190606/16115942347/whining-about-big-tech-doesnt-protect-journalism.shtml#comments</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190606/16115942347/whining-about-big-tech-doesnt-protect-journalism.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190606/16115942347/whining-about-big-tech-doesnt-protect-journalism.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051560193571712251764500068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9R-PPN1-JCMN-Y1FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><timeReceived>7:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 10, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They should be called out in every possible way.'</p><p>He continued to say that he would listen to thousands of recordings every day and from a range of Apple devices, including iPhones, Apple Watches and iPads - any device that included Siri.</p><p>And all of the activity was done without the user's consent.</p><p>However, le Bonniec noted that it was not just the owner of the device's conversations they were harvesting, but they sometimes included relatives, friends, children and colleagues.</p><p>Apple had admitted to the unreported practices following the activity being exposed in July 2019.</p><p>A small portion of Siri requests are analyzed to improve Siri and dictation. User requests are not associated with the user's Apple ID,' said the company.</p><p>'Siri responses are analyzed in secure facilities and all reviewers are under the obligation to adhere to Apple's strict confidentiality requirements.'</p><p>Following the 2019 report, Apple released a statement addressing the concerns.</p><p>'We know that customers have been concerned by recent reports of people listening to audio Siri recordings as part of our Siri quality evaluation process - which we call grading,' reads the announcement.</p><p>'We heard their concerns, immediately suspended human grading of Siri requests and began a thorough review of our practices and policies.'</p><p>'We've decided to make some changes to Siri as a result.'</p><p>However, according to the open letter, Apple may have yet to turn their words into actions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-63057792</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YY6-MY31-F021-62TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><timeReceived>8:38 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

That's what the law says. However, there's a section of that law that says if a reasonable person would look at this and say that lawyer is biased and shouldn't handle it, it's called the public perception of conflict of interest, then the best thing to do is step aside. Clearly that applies here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Gets to the confidence in the institution. Sara Murray, the other thing we learned last week, CNN reported in the last few days, is that the president scolded Matthew Whitaker because he didn't shield the president from what were charges against Michael Cohen that made the president look bad. Explain what happened there and what right the president imagined he had to keep -- to force his attorney general's hand, I suppose, to hold back independent federal prosecutors, pursuing crimes.</p><p>SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, I think this is the exact concern people had when President Trump you know sort of hand plucked Matt Whitaker to be the acting attorney general out of this line of succession, somebody who was not Senate confirmed and President Trump basically made clear to him that he didn't like a number of actions and Mueller's team had taken, a number of you know these reports regarding Michael Cohen that have implicated President Trump. He was livid about that and he shared those frustrations with Matthew Whitaker.</p><p>Now it is pretty stunning because we already know that obviously President Trump has come under plenty of fire for appearing to try to interfere in the Mueller investigation. Matthew Whitaker has come under fire for appearing to have some kind of bias potentially in the Mueller investigation. And this is I think another example of President Trump looking at someone who holds the position of attorney general and saying you are in that job to protect me and to serve me and not to serve the country. But one thing we were talking about, the special counsel regulations to remember is the one thing that they do have to inform Congress about is if let's say Bob Mueller decides he wants to do something like bring charges against someone, and the attorney general, in this case, Matthew Whitaker says, nope, that has to go to Congress. Congress has to be informed about that.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Sara Murray, Paul Callan, thanks very much.</p><p>CALLAN: Thank you.</p><p>SCIUTTO: The country Indonesia reeling from a catastrophic tsunami, a surpise one, hundreds dead. The death toll keeps rising there. Look at these pictures of the devastation. Now there are fears that more tsunamis could strike again within days and without warning.</p><p>[10:38:03] SCIUTTO: The death toll in Indonesia is soaring this morning from a catastrophic tsunami there. Nearly 400 people now confirmed dead. But search crews are still combing through piles of debris. A 10-foot-high wall of water struck without warning. Now Indonesia's president says that he wants a better detection system. All this happening amid fears that more tsunamis could strike within days. The latest now from CNN's Ivan Watson.</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Jim, the death toll from Saturday night's deadly tsunami in Indonesia has surged even as the recovery efforts have been complicated by fears and warnings that a volcano could erupt again and trigger another deadly tsunami. So, the situation that we have was triggered, the Indonesian authorities believe, by Anak Krakatau, that's this volcanic island that is in the middle of the Sunda Strait that erupted on Saturday and sent more than 150 acres, Indonesian authorities say, of mountainside plunging into the sea. They believe that subsequent underwater landslide triggered the deadly wall of water that hit the shores in resort communities in Indonesia that were full of Indonesian tourists on what was supposed to be a Christmas weekend holiday.</p><p>Some of the survivors have told us that they got no warning that this tsunami was coming. In fact, they didn't even see the waters receding, which is sometimes a sign of an impending tsunami.</p><p>The Indonesian president has toured the area and has urged his agencies to create some kind of a new early warning system. An existing one appeared to have been defunct since 2012, suffering from lack of attention and from robberies and vandalism.</p><p>[10:40:00] There was talk of trying to fix it up after another deadly tsunami struck another part of Indonesia in September of this year, killing around 2,000 people after an earthquake. Indonesia is very vulnerable, Jim. It's made up of more than 17,000 islands. It's on the ring of fire, home to more than 125 active volcanoes. So protecting this long coastline will be an immense challenge. Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Ivan Watson thanks very much.</p><p>We take another look now at stocks. Dismal December already. Market down nearly 200 points. A little off its lows right now. Responding to a lot of news. Coming up, we break down this year's top business headlines.</p><p>[10:45:11] SCIUTTO: Wall Street is on track now for one of the worst Decembers since the great depression. But believe it or not, that is not the top business story this year.</p><p>CNN's Christine Romans and Richard Quest have our 2018 year in review.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Iconic American industries transformed.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN EDITOR AT LARGE: The stock market, wild ride.</p><p>ROMANS: The U.S. takes on the world.</p><p>QUEST: Scandals shake confidence in big tech.</p><p>ROMANS: These are the top business stories of 2018.</p><p>QUEST: Number eight, retail implodes as Amazon explodes. This year, two decades old iconic American retailers closed up shop.</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: The dramatic fall from what used to be one of the United States' largest retailers, Sears, filing for bankruptcy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Lost generation of Toys \"R\" Us Kids have spoken across the U.S. All of its stores went out closed.</p><p>ROMANS: Toys \"R\" us and Sears struggled to keep up with retail's digital transformation. Stores like Target, Macy's, and Walmart are investing millions in their websites and mobile apps. The goal, compete with Amazon. The online behemoth dominates the industry with billion dollar profits and a trillion dollar market value, granting its CEO a coveted title.</p><p>QUEST: Jeff Bezos is now the richest person of all time. Two new locations will feel Amazon's power, New York City and Northern Virginia. They won a year-long competition for its second headquarters.</p><p>ROMANS: Number seven, auto companies reckon with the future. Americans are shunning sedans for SUVs. And that's changing the industry. Ford will drop all but two passenger cars from its lineup by the year 2020. And General Motors is restructuring its work force and announcement that sent shockwaves through America's heartland and Washington.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: General Motors, the iconic American automaker is cutting staff and closing plants.</p><p>ROMANS: President Trump slams GM's decision to shutter five north American factories costing 14,000 jobs, but U.S. automakers say it's evolve or die. They're investing in self-driving and electric cars to compete with each other and their new rivals in Silicon Valley.</p><p>QUEST: Number six. Trump versus the Federal Reserve. In 2017, President Trump praised his pick for Fed chief.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's strong. He's committed. He's smart.</p><p>QUEST: Well, that didn't last long. The president, breaking precedent by repeatedly criticizing Jerome Powell for raising interest rates.</p><p>TRUMP: The Fed is out of control.</p><p>Not happy with what he's doing.</p><p>We have much more of a Fed problem than we have a problem with anyone else.</p><p>QUEST: Historically, presidents always avoid confronting the Central Bank. It's supposed to operate independently from political influence. So President Trump's attacks may have unintended consequences if the Fed suddenly slows the pace of rate hikes, that could raise concern it's bowing to political pressure, or the president could do exactly the opposite of what he intended. The Fed may feel it has to raise rates to show it's not surrendered.</p><p>ROMANS: Number five, Elon Musk's erratic behavior cost Tesla and himself. Many credit Tesla's incredible market value to belief in Musk as an innovator, but this year, his actions caused many to question his leadership, like slamming analysts on an investor call.</p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: Boring, bonehead questions are not cool.</p><p>ROMANS: Smoking marijuana during a live broadcast.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>MUSK: It's tobacco and marijuana in there.</p><p>ROMANS: Calling a British cave diver involved in the Thai soccer team rescue a pedophile, and of course, the fiasco over potentially taking Tesla private. Musk stunned investors in August when he tweeted he had secured funding to take the company private, a plan he has since abandoned.</p><p>MUSK: This is kind of crazy.</p><p>ROMANS: That triggered a jump in Tesla's stock price as well as scrutiny from Wall Street's top regulator. The SEC concluded Musk misled investors, forcing him to pay a $20 million fine and step down as Tesla's chairman to settle those charges.</p><p>QUEST: It's number four. Wall Street's wild swings. Now, 2018 started with a bang. And then trading turned volatile.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Happening now, breaking news. Wild ride.

All of them putting strain on a bull market that's already the longest in history.</p><p>ROMANS: Number three, President Trump took on the world, turning his tough trade talk into action, slapping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, ripping up NAFTA for the USMCA, and trashing America's neighbor in the process.</p><p>TRUMP: Canada has treated us very badly. We think they're negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time.</p><p>ROMANS: But what really unsettled investors, a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.</p><p>HARLOW: The president announced new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Well, China shot right back saying it would retaliate with countermeasures.</p><p>ROMANS: China and the U.S. hit each other with tariffs on billions of dollars of goods. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary trade truce in December. Investors hoped that could lead to the real deal, but that could be complicated by the recent arrest of the CFO of a Chinese tech giant in Canada.</p><p>Number two, unemployment hits historic lows.</p><p>BLITZER: 3.7 percent unemployment on the month of September, a 49-year low.</p><p>ROMANS: The U.S. labor market is strong, adding jobs for the past 98 months in a row. But as the U.S. nears what's known as full employment, employers will struggle to find workers. Hiring may slow. But for now, job gains are solid and wages finally started to rise, a missing piece of the recovery so far.</p><p>QUEST: Number one. Facebook scandals which sow distrust the big tech. In March, Facebook reveals it exposed 87 million users to a third- party app. It angered users, advertisers, lawmakers, and investors.</p><p>ROMANS: The data crisis was a hit to Facebook's reputation, already tarnished for its role in spreading misinformation and allowing election meddling. It led to an apology tour for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, concluding with a grilling on Capitol Hill. MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I started Facebook. I run it. And at the end of the day, I am responsible for what happens here.</p><p>QUEST: Facebook promised to spend billions to put privacy first. Users like that.

Still to come, Christmas festivities underway around the world. We will take you live to Bethlehem where one of the biggest celebrations, it's remarkable, is taking place right now.</p><p>[10:58:02] SCIUTTO: Christmas celebrations are underway now around the world, including where it all began, the City of Bethlehem. Thousands of tourists and people on pilgrimage are expected to visit the West Bank town.</p><p>Joining me now from Bethlehem, CNN correspondent Ian Lee. I have been there before. Such a remarkable place, but on this night, it must just be breathtaking.</p><p>IAN LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It really is. Merry Christmas to you, Jim, and to my family back home who is watching. The festivities today have been nonstop. There was a parade earlier where the Latin patriarch, that's the head of the Catholic Church, came from Jerusalem to the church of the nativity right behind me. That's where it all began. That's where Christians believe that Jesus was born.</p><p>I have to tell you, if you're Mary and Joseph, if you didn't have a reservation, there's no room in any inns or hotels tonight as they're fully booked, thousands of pilgrims and tourists coming here, seeing this. You know I talked to one priest. I asked him, what is his Christmas message to his congregation? He said one of love, equality, and justice.</p><p>For the Palestinians as well as for the Israelis and this has been a very deadly and bloody year. There have been scores of Palestinian protesters killed in clashes between the Israeli army and Gazans along that border fence that separates Gaza and Israel. Scores of rockets have also been fired by Gaza militants, and if it really weren't for diplomatic efforts by the U.N., by Egypt, there could have been likely a war.</p><p>So tonight, they're grateful that that was averted. But also, they're here celebrating peace and love and hoping that peace will prevail. And you can hear the music behind me. They're here to celebrate, Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Well, Ian Lee, very Merry Christmas to you as well. And I'm going to take Ian's lead. I'm going to wish my family and friends who are watching a Merry Christmas, and all of you. Thank you so much for joining me today and our whole team here. We wish you the very best for the holidays and the new year.

But worry more about automation's threat to less skilled employees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. For one last time before I leave The New York Times, here's a look at the week's tech news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The story usually goes like this: Automation is going to take our jobs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But the reality is far more nuanced, and debate rages about which jobs will be automated, at what scale and where. For the most part, one thing is agreed on: Blue-collar workers who perform repetitive work are most exposed.</p><p>  That might not be quite right, though. A study published by the Brookings Institution on Wednesday looks at the degree to which professions are exposed to A.I. by comparing job descriptions with patent descriptions of new A.I. technologies, a method developed by the Stanford researcher Michael Webb. It found that A.I. will be ''a significant factor in the future work lives of relatively well-paid managers, supervisors and analysts,'' including those in relatively technical roles.</p><p>  Perhaps the most surprising finding: Holders of bachelor's degrees would be exposed to A.I. over five times more than workers with only a high school degree.</p><p>  ''Lots of math, science, technology and business roles involve, say, operating a power plant to maximize energy efficiency, or running an ad campaign to minimize cost per click,'' explained Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings and one of the study's authors. ''And these are exactly the things that A.I. is best at.''</p><p>  Previously, similar studies lumped together robotics and A.I. But when they are picked apart, it makes sense that A.I. -- which is about planning, perceiving and so on -- would hit white-collar roles.</p><p>  Still, workers needn't panic. Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford University who specializes in technology and employment, said A.I. was ''more likely to complement people in those jobs rather than replacing them.'' And Mr. Muro points out that ''these workers are frequently the ones that companies have already invested in'' and are likely to have been consulted about their futures.</p><p>  Mr. Muro added: ''I for one am a bit less concerned about the white-collar folks than the less educated ones stuck in dead-end service work or the gig economy.''</p><p>  TikTok's Reboot</p><p>  I recently explained how TikTok is in trouble because the red-hot video app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is under scrutiny from lawmakers in the United States. At the heart of this is a big, untested argument that Chinese laws could force TikTok, in theory, to send data to the Chinese government.</p><p>  In an interview with The Times, TikTok's chief executive, Alex Zhu, tried to assuage Washington's fears:</p><p>  No, TikTok does not censor videos that displease China, he said. And no, it does not share user data with China, or even with its Beijing-based parent company.</p><p>  Mr. Zhu said he'd personally reject an appeal for data even if it came from President Xi Jinping.</p><p>  And it's reportedly trying other stuff, too. The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok executives had discussed ''rebranding it in the United States'' and ''expanding operations in Southeast Asia, possibly Singapore -- which would allow executives to distance the video-sharing app from China.''</p><p>  But it's unclear how far such assurances can go. </p><p>  ''There doesn't seem to be a way to assuage regulators in the U.S. without removing that ownership issue,'' Adam Segal, the director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me.</p><p>  In the Times interview, Mr. Zhu said a sale of TikTok's American operations hadn't been discussed. But he didn't rule out the possibility of ByteDance's reorganizing it as a separate company with a new board. It might not have much choice.</p><p>  Disconnected Iran</p><p>  Iran has demonstrated that it's willing to take its citizens offline -- and, perhaps more worryingly, that it's able to do so without plunging domestic infrastructure into chaos.</p><p>  The Iranian government recently imposed an almost complete nationwide internet blackout that lasted for almost five days. It came after protests erupted across the country after the government said it would raise gasoline prices. Amnesty International estimated that as many as 106 people were killed. </p><p>  Mahsa Alimardani, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, explained to me in an email that the Iranian government was trying to limit the spread of evidence of state violence. </p><p>  ''The deaths and the ruthless images of authorities raining bullets on protesters that are being disseminated are not the images they want dominating their narrative,'' she said.</p><p>  Blocking internet traffic and, by extension, social media certainly cuts information flows. But there's little evidence that internet blackouts undermine protests. A 2018 report by Human Rights Watch found ''no substantive data or evidence to prove that internet shutdowns can scale down violence.'' That Iran's blackout persisted, Ms. Alimardani said, was a strong indication that it had done little to calm the protests.</p><p>  But the shutdown revealed one success for Iran's government: its National Information Network, a domestic, highly censored digital infrastructure. That infrastructure enabled the nation's critical services, such as finance and health care, to largely operate normally, demonstrating that the country is well equipped to shut down the public internet.</p><p>  ''They are proving they can and will cut people off if they question authorities again,'' Ms. Alimardani said.</p><p>Google's Staff Clash</p><p>  ''Don't be evil,'' it once said. But Google's internal mantra now looks like it could be more like: ''Don't question the management.''</p><p>  It has come to light that Google has ended its biweekly all-hands meetings. The decision was made just days after Google employees protested the interrogation of two colleagues by the company's investigations team, according to CNBC. And it all comes on the back of a staff protest last year over the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints, vibrant discussions on internal memo boards about company policies and pushback from some workers about Google's work in China and with the United States military.</p><p>  Then, this past week, it transpired that Google had hired an anti-union consulting firm to advise its management as it deals with worker unrest.</p><p>  It's still too early to tell how this will shake out at Google. But what's clear is that the company's traditional embrace of transparency and flexibility for workers is straining as more employees question its motives and actions.</p><p>  Some Stories You Shouldn't Miss</p><p/><p>  What caused Uber's autonomous car crash in 2018?

It welcomed the introduction of a GovTech Catalyst team - which oversees a \u00a320m fund to help tech firms deliver innovative solutions to public sector problems - and said it hoped it would be able to \"open the doors of Whitehall to the burgeoning AI development sector in the UK\". </p><p>It also highlighted to the independent report on growing the UK's AI community published last October, which recommended greater use of AI in the public sector. </p><p>But it called for public procurement regulations to be reviewed and amended \"to ensure that UK-based companies offering AI solutions are invited to tender and given the greatest opportunity to participate\". Government should \"be bold\" when procuring AI systems, and should provide support to businesses to convert ideas to prototypes, it added. </p><p>The committee also recommended the establishment of an online bulletin board, where challenges from across Whitehall and the rest of the public sector - identified by the Government Office for AI as having the potential for AI-based solutions - are advertised. </p><p>Elsewhere in the report, the peers called for \"strategic leadership\" from government on AI, to avoid developing \"overlapping and conflicting\" policies and institutions. The Government Office for AI, they said, should develop a national policy framework for AI, which should be \"in lockstep with the Industrial Strategy\". </p><p>They also said the Government Office for AI should coordinate work between the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, the GovTech Catalyst team and the national research centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (the Alan Turing Institute), as well as the AI Council it was established to support. </p><p>The report also touched on the difficulty for government in attracting AI experts, because it can't match the salaries offered by the private sector. </p><p>Lord Clement-Jones, committee chair, said the UK would be able to take advantage of the benefits of AI and lead on its \"ethical development\" internationally - if it took up the recommendations put forward by the Lords committee. </p><p>He added: \"The UK contains leading AI companies, a dynamic academic research culture, and a vigorous start-up ecosystem as well as a host of legal, ethical, financial and linguistic strengths. We should make the most of this environment, but it is essential that ethics take centre stage in AI's development and use. </p><p>\"AI is not without its risks and the adoption of the principles proposed by the committee will help to mitigate these. An ethical approach ensures the public trusts this technology and sees the benefits of using it. It will also prepare them to challenge its misuse.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVSCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVSCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S47-HYF1-F0JV-84PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436917</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><timeReceived>12:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Civil Service World (online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00080KU</classCode><className>AI SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I  went to the Jets game yesterday, they won, 38-7.  But you know that  already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> IMUS:  Yes, I don't care about the Jets game because they were already in  the playoffs.  So I don't care about the Seattle Seahawks and the Rams  people, but I'll find out apparently from Warner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MCSHANE:  So one of them with - record made the playoffs.  I'm being told  in my ear, you want to know who won now or no?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> IMUS:  No, let me find out from Warner, because, Warner likes to tell me  stuff like that.</p><p> MCSHANE:  It is Warner's job.</p><p> IMUS:  Santa brought us a goofy tie?  Is that what happened? </p><p> MCSHANE:  No, I had that one already, I-man.</p><p> IMUS:  The funny tie, under the tree.</p><p> MCSHANE:  So you got two weeks off and that is the best you could come up  with.</p><p> IMUS:  That's all I could come up with.</p><p> MCSHANE:  You sound great, by the way.  How this is voice, good?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I don't have throat cancer, they tell me, but I do have --  pre-cancerous cells.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Really? </p><p> IMUS:  Yes --and, like if you had a colonoscopy and they find this --  remove them, so, these are -- they have to take them off with a laser here  in a couple of weeks, and this is way too much information.</p><p> MCSHANE:  I actually care.  I told you, I care.</p><p> IMUS:  I'll be fine.</p><p> MCSHANE:  You will be OK, that is the main point.</p><p> IMUS:  Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, and Mary Matalin coming up this morning.   Three new radio affiliates - have you even seen that guy who does the red  eye thing here on Fox.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Is he any good.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, sure.   It's fine.  I don't watch it.  It is on in the  middle of the night, but a lot of people like it.</p><p> IMUS:  I saw him on the news with Megyn Kelly and -- too happy to suit me,  but he seemed funny.</p><p> MCSHANE:  He is pretty funny.</p><p> IMUS:  I wonder if we should have him on.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Sure, why not.  Give it a try.</p><p> IMUS:  Is he any good?  He is good.  You are saying that because we're on - - on TV, here, aren't you.</p><p> MCSHANE:  That is why, yes.</p><p> IMUS:  What is going on with business -- how this is Facebook deal, Goldman  Sachs.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, $50 billion valuation on Facebook.  It's no joke right  there.</p><p> IMUS:  Please.</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's what Goldman thinks it's worth anyway.  I will get to that  in a second, but thank you, I-man and good morning.  First, let's bring up  the markets and look up some numbers here because stocks are starting off  the new week and the New Year with some gains here globally.</p><p>  China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and  if anything that's actually easing concerns about inflation and the Chinese  market at the bottom screen is up 1-3/4 percent overnight.</p><p>  Markets in Hong Kong and South Korea are also up, and Japan has not  resumed trading yet in the New Year.  Over in Europe, London is closed  today for the New Year's holiday, but Paris and Frankfurt are both up  significantly, Paris by more than 2 percent and our futures indicating a  higher open on Wall Street as well up by 76 points on Dow futures, pretty  good numbers.</p><p>  Now as for the major indexes and how they fared in 2010, the Dow gained 11  percent, S&amp;P 13 percent, the Nasdaq the best performer of the bunch, 17  percent gain.</p><p>  The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on more  debt national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion ceiling and the  White House Council of Economic Advisors, Chairman Austin Goolsbee on ABC's  \"This Week\" saying it's crucial the ceiling is raised.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AUSTIN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS:  This is not a  game, you know, the debt ceiling is not something to toy with.  That is the  -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that is the -- essentially defaulting on our  obligations, which is unprecedented in American history. The impact on the  economy would be catastrophic.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Many Republicans agree it does need to be raised but, many of  them are also saying they will not go along with it unless they get  promises to change Washington's spending habits and argue there is no point  in having a debt ceiling if they raise it every time the national debt gets  close.  Now here's the story that the I-man was referring to a moment ago.</p><p>  Goldman Sachs investing $450 million in Facebook, according to the \"New  York Times.\"  A Russian company also buying $50 million worth of Facebook's  stock.  \"The Times\" says these deals value Facebook at $50 billion.  Now,  as we have reported the FCC now looking into secondary market trading at  Facebook's privately held shares.</p><p>  Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its web site, the latest  development in the conflict between airlines and online travel agencies,  since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says Expedia intentionally  listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.  American is  looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own web site and every  effort to save money.  Expedia says the move will only cost them ticket  sales and believes Americans' efforts are bad for travellers.</p><p>  All right, let's take a live look now at commodities this morning.  The  oil price is above $92 per barrel and gold is down by a dollar per ounce.</p><p>  Coming up, a little bit later on in the hour, Bo Dietl will be the I-man's  guest as IMUS IN THE MORNING does get started, right now, Fox Business,  power to prosper.</p><p> IMUS:  Warner, who won the football game last night?</p><p> WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER:  Seahawks, man, they finished 7-9.  Win the  division and are in the playoffs.</p><p> IMUS:  So the giants, who are 10-6, they are not in the playoffs.</p><p> WOLF:  You got it.  No, you have to change the rule.</p><p> CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN:  That is crazy.</p><p> WOLF:  Absurd, yes.</p><p> IMUS:  I will whip somebody's butt over there -- Charles and I.</p><p> WOLF:  Now you're talking.</p><p> IMUS:  Charles and me, yes.  And, I get my grammar screwed up.  Happy New  Year, everybody.</p><p> BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  Shucks.</p><p> IMUS:  Bring you up on my medical, last time --</p><p> MCCORD:  Let's have the latest.</p><p> IMUS:  I'm had a biopsy -- let me say this about Mt. Sinai.  It is a great  hospital.  You know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and Cornell and Mt. Sinai  is a great hospital.  The nurses are unbelievable and Dr. Peekaboo Woo, and  Dr. Allen Reid, the anesthesiologist, are fabulous.</p><p> MCCORD:  Good.</p><p> IMUS:  They all did a great job and I apparently do not have throat cancer.   What I have are these pre-cancerous cells.</p><p> MCCORD:  Dysplasia, yes. </p><p> IMUS:  Yes.  Charles knows more about what I have than I do.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes. </p><p> IMUS:  So, they have to remove them with a laser, and, at a high level, and  they would develop into -- </p><p> MCCORD:  Get rid of them, that is why we get rid of them.</p><p> IMUS:  And you know how I got them?  Smoking.</p><p> MCCORD:  Really?  That is what they say?  OK.</p><p> IMUS:  I haven't smoked for 15 years, but - </p><p> MCCORD:  Listen to that, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p> IMUS:  Anyway, so I'm fine, Bo Dietl, Jerry Greenfield.</p><p> MCCORD:  That's great news to start the new year.</p><p> IMUS:  Bo Dietl, still have prostate cancer but, I think I do.  I'm not  sure anymore whether I do or not.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes, may have defeated that.</p><p> IMUS:  And, I came back from the ranch on Saturday.</p><p> MCCORDs:  That's 700 miles an hour with the freaking tail wind.</p><p> IMUS:  What a great vacation.  It's 10 degrees.  We have to go out there,  because we run the place.  It's 10 degrees -- the wind - there's not a ski  resort.</p><p> MCCORD:  How about that wind?</p><p> IMUS:  The wind blows and I'm not exaggerating, 60 miles an hour.  Anyway,  Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, Mary Matalin, coming up and we have three new  radio affiliates, and when I put my glasses on I'll tell you who they are.</p><p>  I'm not going to do it now and, ratings came out in New York and for  people -- the ratings are broken down, all kinds of demographics and I  don't believe in them but I think they give you a rough idea, of you know - - I mean, you can -- like lit-fm or one of those -- hot 97 or one of these.   Whoever these stations are, that do well.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes. </p><p> IMUS:  And if it is consistent over a long period of time, like when stern  was on terrestrial radio, you knew he was number one, and had been on a  long time, a trend that remains supported, consistency.</p><p> IMUS:  So, but on these 12-plus numbers they measure people by demographics  like break it down to 12 to 18, 25-54, 18-34, it is ridiculous.  Men,  women, all of this and there's another one they do and it is just everybody  who is 12 years of age or older. And, this program, the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program, is the number 2 program in New York.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Get out of town!</p><p> MCCORD:  Shut the front door!</p><p> IMUS:  Now, of course, I told Connell and Dagen that part of that, because,  they are about the only new thing we have done here, other than I have a  better attitude.  They were partly responsible for that and then I got to  thinking about it and if it weren't for them, we could have easily been  number one.</p><p> MCCORD:  Number one.  Yes.</p><p> MCSHANE:  I'm sorry, I-man.</p><p> IMUS:  Which is the reason, when I got fired, and got the job at ABC I  insisted on bringing Lou and Bernie, and Charles and everybody else,  because, I knew without them, I would just be -- if it weren't for them, I  would be on some station, in Jersey with Uncle Floyd.</p><p> LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER:  Uncle Floyd!</p><p> IMUS:  I'd be on Sirius satellite radio.  Mel likes me, to give me a job  for 50 grand a year.  And sit there - </p><p> RUFINO:  At UHF -- </p><p> IMUS:  The I-man's blues channel, Blues and alternate country on Sirius.   But, as it is -- so the show -- I've never been number 2, ever.  Not back  when --</p><p> MCCORD:  Your best ratings.</p><p> IMUS:  Not back when I was.  So I'm happy about that and it is a great  program.  It's a better program than it ever was.  Having very little to do  -- not being self-effacing, having we little to do with me, Bernie, Lou,  they are all great.  Time for a little news and here with that is Chuck  McCord.  Good morning, Charles.</p><p> MCCORD:  Good morning, I-man.  Speaking of the weather, the main highway  between southern and central California, shut down, both directions,  blowing snow and ice from another big storm.  The grapevine area of I-5  closed indefinitely, winds gusting to -- reminded me, winds, gusting to 90  miles per hour in mountain areas, and still accumulating at elevations, as  low as just 1,500 feet.</p><p>  President Obama, says he is honored to sign the bill to provide aid to  survivors of the 9/11 attacks, and first responders, all of whom --</p><p> IMUS:  You know -- </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  \"The New York Times\" did an article about the stuff that Jon  Stewart, who as you know, I like, stuff Jon Stewart did about the 9/11  bill.</p><p> MCCORD:  I saw it and all of that.</p><p> IMUS:  And wondering if Jon Stewart was under Edward R. Murrow, which I  would hope even Jon Stewart would be embarrassed about.  But perhaps he's  not or we don't know because I don't know him, but I would suggest -- and  it has nothing do with anything, but until Shep Smith went on the rant that  he went on, as a result of seeing Jon Stewart's show, which Shep said he  did, and -- hey, big foot -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir.</p><p> IMUS:  There's the famous rap that Shep Smith did, he was talking to  somebody, and he referenced Jon Stewart, and he had seen the Jon Stewart  show apparently the night before, there's got to be a way to find that,  right.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, we'll find it.</p><p> IMUS:  He was -- first of all, they are both terrific, both Stewart and  Shep Smith is magnificent.  Few better, in fact -- I don't know if there is  anybody better, but it was a respond -- did you site, Bernie.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes.  I did --</p><p> IMUS:  Am I right?</p><p> MCGUIRK:  On the money, a 100 percent.</p><p> IMUS:  He was absolutely spectacular.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  I happened to see that.</p><p> IMUS:  And it seemed to me it was spontaneous.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Certainly seemed that way.</p><p> IMUS:  And the boy seemed to be articulate to me and I have to play it for  you.  So I think that if you are a bunch of Republicans, I -- remember I  had John Thune on and he was giving me some nonsense about -- didn't wanted  to rush into it.</p><p>  I didn't press him hard on that, not as much as I should have, and, you  know, the -- I started to say to him, you know, don't want to rush into  anything and, I hope we get it before all of these people die.  So, people  like Senator Thune, who I am no longer supporting for anything -- </p><p> MCGUIRK:  That may be premature. The Republicans -- they ended up saving $3  billion from that particular bill. That is what they were holding out for,  eliminate --</p><p> IMUS:  They weren't going to do it until they got shamed into it by Jon  Stewart and by Shep Smith, I'm saying.  And when Shep Smith attacked them,  I'm sure they were thinking, that is our home boy there, at Fox.</p><p>  I mean, I'm sure in their minds they are thinking if we lost Shep Smith we  lost the country.  You would expect Jon Stewart.  I thought it was  magnificent what he did, by the way, but you expect him to do what he did  but you wouldn't expect Shep Smith to do what he did and if you lose him  you lost everybody.  I mean, I'm sure they are thinking that and go that  the scared into passing it, didn't they, Bernie, talking about the money  they saved, because you carry water for them.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  That's the fact.  Chuck Schumer's bill was $7 billion and, the  bill ended up being $4 billion and they saved --</p><p> IMUS:  But they wouldn't have done anything, had there not been those two  events, am I right.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Perhaps, there's no way to conclusively prove that, but it sure  seems that way.</p><p> IMUS:  And let me ask you this, for everybody who thinks, Sarah Palin is a  moron, and I would be one of them, would you would this country be any  worse off today if she were president?  Answer me that.  Tell me.  I'm  waiting --</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Checkmate for the I-man.</p><p> MCCORD:  There you go.</p><p> IMUS:  Because, at least -- think whatever you want to think about her, and  think as I do, maybe, even.  I don't know that I think she is a moron but  she'd have sense enough to at least ask the people rather than get the same  people bush had.  But, this dope has been doing -- I mean, is he still on  vacation in Hawaii, by the way?</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.  He comes back I think late today.</p><p> IMUS:  And then, on I-25, out there in Santa Fe, when you go up to the  ranch into Santa Fe, before you get into Santa Fe, there was a guy has a  houses -- a lot of people have houses, a guy has a house, puts up these  goofy billboards, a homemade billboard. </p><p>  And, makes me laugh every time, they change and he's obviously a Hannity  devotee or one of them and once he has had up there for a while.  Where is  the birth certificate?  The hand lettered dopey sign, where is the birth  certificate.  Here's my question -- where is it?  I mean, I'm not a --  obviously I'm not one of those --</p><p> MCGUIRK:  A birther?</p><p> IMUS:  Of course not.  But, where is it?</p><p> MCCORD:  I don't know.</p><p> IMUS:  Isn't the governor of ha walkers wasn't he screaming all about it?</p><p> MCGUIRK:  He's claiming --</p><p> IMUS:  Where is it?</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes, let's see it.  Clear this up.</p><p> IMUS:  I mean, if the guy who is supporting the president -- which I would  tend to support him, too, by the way.  But I just say.</p><p> MCCORD:  Let's resolve this.</p><p> IMUS:  Why haven't we ever seen it or why don't they produce it, I can't  answer that.</p><p> IMUS:  It just adds fuel to these nuts.</p><p> MCCORD:  Of course it does.</p><p> IMUS:  Anyway, 16 after the hour, taking way too much time with my  nonsense, did you do any news at all?  I interrupted you, 9/11 bill.</p><p> MCCORD:  The James Zadroga bill has been signed by the president there in  Hawaii, yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Carly?  Anymore coffee?  She left -- </p><p> MCCORD:  I'll go get you some.</p><p> IMUS:  She said what did Wyatt get for Christmas and I couldn't remember,  horse stuff.  She said, well does she still believe in Santa Claus? </p><p> MCCORD:  And your reply.</p><p> IMUS:  I said, well, I still believe in Santa Claus.  Why wouldn't he?  You  know, 17 after the hour, Warner will do a little sports and before that, a  quick business update, from Connell McShane here on the Fox Business  Network and on the radio as well.  Good morning, Connell.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Good morning, I-man.  I'm talking about the markets here, as we  start off the new trading year to the up side, after a pretty good year in  2010, stocks are up, globally, this morning.</p><p>  News out of China that show the economy there slowing down a little bit,  seen as a good sign because it eases concerns about inflation.  Anyway, the  futures are up.  The European markets that are open are all up and the  Asian markets were up, overnight as well.</p><p>  Now, as for the year in 2010, the Dow ended the year, with a gain of 11  percent, the S&amp;P was up 13 percent, and the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch,  with a rise of nearly 17 percent, in 2010.</p><p> IMUS:  Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning and Dagen  McDowell will be along -- you guys still have your show 11:00 a.m.</p><p> MCSHANE:  So far, I believe, yes. </p><p> IMUS:  OK, we'll start the year, brand new year with their show and they'll  still do that and, that's good.  Three new radio affiliates, WAUB at 1590  and 98.1 FM, out there in Auburn, New York and WGVA, at 1240, in Geneva,  New York.  Finger Lakes news radio, they call that.</p><p>  And, KWKC, 1340, on the AM dial, down there in Abiline, Texas, talk radio  1340 and they joined the IMUS In The Morning line-up of stations around the  country beginning this morning.  Time for a little sports now and here with  that is Warner Wolf.  Good morning, Warner.</p><p> WOLF:  Good morning, I-man, well, completing the NFL picture, the playoffs  last night, Seattle wins the NFC West with a record of 7-9.  Come on! </p><p> IMUS:  Who do they play, New Orleans?</p><p> WOLF:  They'll play the Saints, yes, on Saturday.  You have to change the  rule here very quickly.  You know, forget winning the division, if you have  a losing record you are not in the playoffs.  You take the team with the  next best record, which would have been the Giants or the Bucks at 10-6.</p><p>  Earlier, the Packers beat the Bears, 10-3.  The Packers, 10-6, win the  final wildcard.  AFC, the Colts win the AFC South, on the 43 yard field  goal, last play of the game, although the Colts had won it minutes earlier  when the Jags were eliminated.  Steelers, win the AFC.  North Falcons win  the NFC South so the playoffs are all set.</p><p>Packers, Eagles, in Philadelphia and Saints and Seahawks in Seattle, Jets  and Colts in Indianapolis and the Ravens and Chiefs in Kansas City, yes,  did you watch any of the bowl games?</p><p> WOLF:  None.</p><p> IMUS:  You know, I've watched them all, except I didn't pay any attention  to them because they don't mean anything.</p><p> WOLF:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  Including the one -- a week from tonight, Auburn and Oregon, you  make me watch that.</p><p> WOLF:  Yes, I'll watch that.</p><p> IMUS:  I won't be watching it. So, you'll watch that?</p><p> WOLF:  Yes, I will.</p><p> IMUS:  Why wouldn't you be at Imus on Broadway, wouldn't you want to see  that?</p><p> WOLF:  A conflicting time.</p><p> IMUS:  It is that night.  It's already  sold out, so, I mean -- I could try  to get you in, but -- you don't express any interest, and every day you can  go to some stupid movie and routinely get a half a chicken sandwich or  tuna, whatever the hell you eat, a bottle of wine and go to the gym and,  see a stupid movie, park in the handicapped zone and then, go to some  idiot's Broadway musical or play of some sort and yet you won't come see  Imus on Broadway.  That is Monday night.  You will watch the stupid game  between Auburn and Oregon? </p><p> WOLF:  No, forget that bowl game!</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Too late.</p><p> IMUS:  They got to get a playoff.  They have playoffs, I mean, just stupid  they don't have that.  Don't you agree, Warner?</p><p> WOLF:  Absolutely, every baseball, basketball, college, hockey and --  everything, all have playoffs, except football.</p><p> IMUS:  Speaking of Imus on Broadway, Colin Quinn, who stars in long story  short, which I saw which is genius stuff, directed by Jerry Seinfeld, Colin  now joined the line-up of Broadway musical shows that will perform Monday  night at the Hard Rock.</p><p> MCCORD:  Great.</p><p> IMUS:  For the Imus cattle ranch for kids with cancer.  And, the legendary  emcee, which I exchanged e-mails throughout the past two weeks with, Dick  Cavett is our emcee and that is worth going to see, to see him.</p><p>  And I'll be there, just to introduce him.  I wanted to thank our title  sponsor, GMC and, one place you can go to look great, feel good and feel  great and a GMC sales associate will show you the latest and greatest  health and fitness products.  Imus on Broadway, brought do you by GMC,  which we're going to tape that -- probably -- are we going to tape it, big  foot, or not.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We'll tape it if you want.</p><p> IMUS:  I don't know, I don't know, if you can or not.  Anyway, Warner Wolf  sports, sponsored by American-made Peerless Boilers and the new 96 percent  efficient purifier series.  You have any more sports, Warner?</p><p> WOLF:  There's one more thing, listen to this, I-man the Grizzlies beat the  slumping Lakers last night, in L.A., by 19 points.  And after the game,  Phil Jackson really took it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p> PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH:  As a result, you know, behind  early in the third quarter, on -- stupid plays, and, Kobe has to screw up,  you know, the game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one, and  takes the rest of the guys out --</p><p> WOLF:  Wow.  Kobe's screwing up the game.  Phil Jackson.  That is pretty  harsh.</p><p> IMUS:  You know who I have become a fan of now? </p><p> WOLF:  Kevin Durant?</p><p> IMUS:  No.  The Miami Heat.  I'll tell you why --</p><p> WOLF:  Why, I-man?</p><p> RUFINO:  Can't wait for this.</p><p> IMUS:  Shut up, Lou!  I'll tell you why.</p><p> WOLF:  I wonder why.</p><p> RUFINO:  Miami heat, good God! </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Courageous.</p><p> WOLF:  It has nothing to do with the fact they've won 17 out of the last 18  and 11 in a row.</p><p> IMUS:  No.  No.  Because, something Magic Johnson said.  He said, LeBron  James is playing out of his mind, and he said it is time to stop booing  him.  He may -- you may be unhappy that he left Cleveland and the way he  went about it but, you have to get over that. The guy is a great basketball  player.  So, they have got that together.</p><p> MCCORD:  This is why?</p><p> IMUS:  What's wrong?</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Why didn't he go to a team that didn't have a bunch of star  players and elevate them as most great players do?</p><p> IMUS:  Because that wasn't our plan.  It's 24 after the hour.  All right,  Steven Stills is 66 years old today.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> IMUS:  Looking for an investment opportunity but not sure where to start?   Check out Planet Fitness's -- what \"Inc. Magazine\" calls one of the fastest  growing companies in America.  Miami heat, God.</p><p> MCCORD:  Pathetic.</p><p> IMUS:  You shut up!  A huge outfit, available in the Midwest, and, western  states, and - I-man enough to know when I make a mistake, forget about the  Lakers.  Forget about them.  Oklahoma -- forget -- Oklahoma?</p><p>  They don't play basketball.

All right back now to the  IMUS IN THE MORNING program on FOX Business, the power to prosper.     </p><p> WILLIS:  Tonight on \"THE WILLIS REPORT,\" he says Americans will be paying  $5 a gallon for gas as soon as next year, I'll be joined by former  president of Shell John Hofmeister for his scary predictions, tune in  tonight and every weeknight at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time for \"THE WILLIS  REPORT\" on the FOX Business Network, the power to prosper.     </p><p> IMUS:  All right.  Thirty minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program, Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, Mary Matalin, all coming up  this morning, this week we are playing the five favorite songs of Peter  Rodriguez from New York, New York.  His five favorite songs, the Allman  Brothers, \"One Way Out,\" \"Jungleland,\" Bruce Springsteen, \"Give me  Shelter,\" The Stones,  \"While my Guitar Gently Weeps,\" the Beatles, and,  \"Landslide,\" Fleetwood Mac, not a horrible list.   </p><p> MCCORD:  Peta.  </p><p> IMUS:  Huh?</p><p> RUFINO:  Peta Griffin.</p><p> MCCORD:  Peta.   </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCCORD:  This song sucks.</p><p> IMUS:  Time for little business news and here with all that, on the FOX  Business Network and on the radio as well is Dagen McDowell.  Good morning,  Dagen.   </p><p>  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, sir.   </p><p>  IMUS:  How are you?   </p><p>  MCDOWELL:  I'm good, welcome back, good to see you, sound great, look even  better.  </p><p> IMUS:  All right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  All righty.  So, iPhone, the Apple in its iPhone seemed to fall  down on the job during the first two days of 2011 when the alarms that some  iPhone owners set failed to go off, leaving folks to oversleep, apparently,  it was one time alarm settings, not the recurrent ones saying, Apple will  not say what went wrong with it but, apparently it will be fixed from here  on out.  I gave my mama an iPad for Christmas.  </p><p>  IMUS:  Oh, you did?   </p><p>  MCDOWELL:  Yes, and, she opened it up and it was sealed, bought it at the  Apples store at Danbury Mall, it was sealed she opened it and it said Happy  Holidays, Dennis Piper and Alan Rosenthal (ph).  It was engraved by two  Endodontists that worked in Norwalk, that was my mama's Christmas gift from  us.  She kept it though.  </p><p> IMUS:  I don't quite understand you.  Did you Charles?  </p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The iPad was engraved by these two Endodontists who apparently  given them to their staff or costumers and somebody returned it to the  Apple store and exchange it.  But Apple.</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, they sold to you for.</p><p> MCDOWELL: .and they sold it to me at no discounted, I might add.  </p><p> IMUS:  What was the story then, the Apple store?   </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, Apple store, so, mama got a kick out of it.  I thought it  was appropriate, you know, Christmas gift, root canals, you know, spending  time with your family, all kinds of seems, dove tell together.   </p><p> IMUS:  I thought she would have been offended that it didn't say Merry  Christmas.   </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, no.  She was probably offended by the fact we got her the  cheaper one, see the Wi-Fi, we got her the one with where you can -- the  AT&amp;T.   </p><p> IMUS:  That's the one you got to have, so.   </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Well, we chintz out on that, Merry Christmas, mama, that's  it.   </p><p> IMUS:  Why wouldn't you take it back?   </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Too lazy, too much trouble.  </p><p> IMUS:  For your mama?   </p><p>  MCDOWELL:  Yes.  She seems happy with it.  She's fine.  And, I only have  to see her like twice a year, what she'll going to do about it?   </p><p>  IMUS:  She's crying inside.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p> IMUS:  She has to seem happy, so, she's happy that this marriage of yours  is working out apparently, so far.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  She's not happy I'm not living at home with three kids, single.   </p><p> IMUS:  Yes, and surprised.  Thirty three minutes after the hour, time for a  Bernie briefing sponsored by PC Richard and Son.  And here with all of that  is Bernard McGuirk.  Good morning, Bernie.   </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Good morning, chief.  Well, like most of us during the break, we  were either skiing in Switzerland or down in St. Barts, you know, lounging  off of P. Diddy's yacht or something.  So, we weren't paying attention to a  lot of things.  But over the break, President Obama apparently made a phone  call as the I-man not doubt heard about to the owner of the Philadelphia  Eagles, and during the course of a conversation about something else, he  mentioned to them that he was very happy that the owner signed their  quarterback Michael Vick, who has been just tearing it up on the field, at  least he was until a couple of days after this news came out.  And he told  him that he was glad, because a lot of ex-cons in society don't get a  second chance, he was very happy for the success of Michael Vick and the  fact that the guy gave him the opportunity and of course a lot of people  really just can't believe that he made that kind of phony waded into this  controversy unnecessarily.  </p><p>  IMUS:  Plus he has a dog, doesn't he?   </p><p>  MCGUIRK:  Yes.    </p><p>  IMUS:  Don't they have a dog?  </p><p>  MCGUIRK:  He's going to need a secret service himself now to protect him  from the president.   </p><p>  IMUS:  Michael Vick comes to the White House, well, that is unfair, that's  not right.   </p><p>  MCGUIRK:  But yes, he does.  And, of course, again as I said, that  following Sunday, Vick played a terrible game.  Not that the two had any  connection.  </p><p>  IMUS:  I don't see anything wrong with that.  You don't think the  president should have weighed in on it?   </p><p>  MCGUIRK:  No, not at all.  I think it's unnecessary again, it's just like  the Beer Summit with the cop versus the Harvard professor.  You just going  to alienate a bunch of people, there's no reason that people now is going  to take side, they'll going to hate -- if they needed a reason to hate  President Obama, this will give it to them, a lot of dog lovers, even  though I agree, the guy deserves a second chance.   </p><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  I don't know.  That is working pretty hard trying to find  something to wolf on Obama about.   </p><p>  MCGUIRK:  Well, I agree he deserves a second chance but the president  should not. </p><p>  IMUS:  The president deserves a second chance, I'm going to give it to him  now.  You know, I shouldn't say this.  But I actually feel like now, here  in New York, we have a governor.  I love David Paterson, that's sort of, I  guess maybe that is not right.  That's not right.  Bo Dietl is coming up,  we're going to talk to him.  Actually, Santa brought you an extra ten  pounds, huh?   </p><p>  RUFINO:  Oh!   </p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  Thanks, Bernie.  Bo Dietl is next.  It's one of Peter Rodriguez's  five favorite songs, Beatles.   </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p>  MCCORD:  You think it, he says it.  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, time now for a business  update, from the FOX Business Network, here's Connell McShane.</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right.  Your latest news update, starts with, this story  about Facebook in the \"New York Times\" this morning, the report is Goldman  Sachs is investing $450 million in Facebook, a Russian Company reportedly  also buying $50 million worth of Facebook stock.  Now, \"The Times\" is  saying this deals value Facebook at $50 billion.  As we reported, the SEC  is looking into the secondary market trading of Facebook's privately held  shares.  </p><p> And Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its Web site, the latest  development of the conflict between airlines and on-line travel agencies  since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says, Expedia  intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.   American is looking to push the consumers to buy tickets on its own Web  Site, in an effort to save money.  As -- there's a look at some of your top  stories, more news coming up as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues, right now,  with the check on the forecast.  </p><p> SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan  from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast.  You can see, we do  still have rain showers here in the southwest, and snow showers in the  higher elevations.  Most of the U.S. is looking very clear, and as we look  to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain  showers in New England along the coastline.  The midsection, lots of  sunshine, a slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis and as we look at  the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to  see many if any delays travel wise, because of the weather.  Other than  possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to the rain/snow mix.   I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program, on the FOX Business  Network.     </p><p> IMUS:  All right.  Eighteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Jeff Greenfield, CBS News, Mary Matalin, down in New Orleans,  probably somewhere, they're both coming up, this portion of the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program is sponsored by State Bank, real people, real solutions,  statebankli.com.  Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, for  his regular visit, our old friend Bo Dietl, good morning, Mr. Dietl.   </p><p> BO DIETL, FOUNDER, BEAU DIETL AND ASSOCIATES:  Good morning and Happy New  Year to you and your family, everybody of the Imus family, Happy New Year  and it is a New Year and let's look forward to prosperity.  </p><p> IMUS:  OK.   </p><p> DIETL:  OK.    </p><p> IMUS:  So, you don't bet on football games anymore?   </p><p> DIETL:  I have not bet one -- or one football game.  I don't have the money  anymore where I used to come in.  I used to roll in, it doesn't roll any  more.  I got four iPads because you showed me this, thank God for credit  cards, I got this 64 gigabyte with the Wi-Fi for my four children there.   And they all got one and, you know what, we lost a great guy last year,  George Steinbrenner.  Now, I can tell the story.  George Steinbrenner did  for me like nobody else did for me.  My daughter, Dana, who is the -- as a  senior at the University of Tampa, at first when she tried to apply there,  they only accepting a thousand students and her average was about 3.2, they  told her, you have to go to another college and matriculate, she starts  crying, dad, I wanted to go there, I wanted to go, I called Brandy Levine  and asked Mr. Steinbrenner if he could maybe possibly help her get in.  Mr.  Steinbrenner got back to me and says, help her get in.  Two days later, he  was accepted into the University in Tampa.  She now has a 4.0, she's on the  Dean's list, honors society and she might become the valedictorian for the  University of Tampa, my daughter Dana, I'm very proud.</p><p> IMUS:  Pretty good, huh?</p><p> DIETL:  And George Steinbrenner did it and my love out for the Steinbrenner  family, a lot of people don't realize what he does.  I sent him.   </p><p> IMUS:  Why did she want to go there?   </p><p> DIETL:  No.  She's graduating.   </p><p> IMUS:  No, no, why did she want to go there?   </p><p> DIETL:  I don't know.  It became like a kind of these kids get into a fad  like all the friends are going.  And then they all want to go -- at the  high school, they all want to go.  It is a very good school, she's doing  teaching of disabled, you know, speech therapy, that kind of stuff, to  teach people how to speak, she probably have to. </p><p> IMUS:  Should have started with you?  </p><p> DIETL:  Yes, I know.  I knew you were going to say that.   </p><p> MCCORD:  Is she adopted?  </p><p> DIETL:  Take it easy.  No, she looks just like me.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> She looks like just me, but.  </p><p> IMUS:  Your daughter looks like you?   </p><p> DIETL:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, you know what?  Put it this way, they look  like a very good-looking version of a fat old man like me.   </p><p> IMUS:  Well, you are not an unattractive man but...   </p><p> DIETL:  Yes, so...   </p><p> IMUS:  Not as much an extra ten pounds but...   </p><p> DIETL:  All right.  Well, you want to know something?  I eat.  I don't eat  lamb's regurgitations and all that stuff like you do.  Now, over the  holidays.   </p><p> IMUS:  Oh, you don't have cancer like I do.   </p><p> DIETL:  John Mariotti, it's called \"The Chinese Conspiracy,\" this book is  for you.   </p><p> IMUS:  No, don't give to it me.  I won't read it.  </p><p> DIETL:  OK.</p><p> IMUS:  I don't want it.   </p><p> DIETL:  OK.  Well, can I talk about it?  Because it's a great novel.   </p><p> IMUS:  Talk about what you want.   </p><p> DIETL:  OK.  \"The Chinese Conspiracy\" by John Mariotti is a new novel that  is out but the novel is based on a lot of facts.  We know what happened  with the Pentagon, with the breaking into the Supernet computers and all of  that kind of stuff, the Chinese.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> DIETL:  But this talks about a group of young Chinese guys that wanted to  overthrow the old Ancient guard of China.  So, what they do is they  infiltrate all of our systems, all of our technologies systems, our grid  and everything, and they shut down, they shut down the American -- all the  IT., all the planes.   </p><p> IMUS:  What happens?</p><p> DIETL:  What?</p><p> IMUS:  How does this happen that somebody gets this -- do you know this  guy?   </p><p> DIETL:  I don't know this guy but I'm going to tell you something.  I can,  I find a book, because. </p><p> IMUS:  You can't. </p><p> DIETL:  One of your yak-swallowing friends over there, one of your liberal  friends, they come over here. </p><p> IMUS:  Yak-swallowing friends. </p><p> DIETL:  But this guys from \"Newsweek,\" news day, all of the liberal pieces  of garbage, they give you something that is OK, this is a great novel  because based it's based on fact, \"The Chinese Conspiracy,\" it's about  reality, if Greenfield is sitting there, like this, blah, blah, then it  would be good.  Why can't I have a little, a little show time here?  You  have all these other guys, these guys that ran away from you, I stand by  you!  I'm loyal!  So, listen to me, once in a while!   </p><p> IMUS:  All I asked you...   </p><p> DIETL:  Great book.</p><p> IMUS:  By the way, when I got fired, you were going on all of those shows  running your fat mouth.  I had to -- I had to tell you to shut up, you were  talking too much.   </p><p> DIETL:  I went on with that.</p><p> IMUS:  I had to get you to shut up!  You were going around quoting me,  saying stuff that I never said.  I didn't want you to stick up for me, I  didn't need to be stuck up for.  I didn't want people going around and  making any excuses for me.  There wasn't any excuse, there is no excuse  now.  Your mic has been off for five minutes -- a minute.   </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> DIETL:  You sit on the board of the directors, you shouldn't be talking  about. </p><p> IMUS:  Hang on a minute.  Hang on a minute.</p><p> DIETL:  OK.</p><p> IMUS:  All I wondered was, I'm sure the book is fine.  </p><p> DIETL:  It is great book because...   </p><p> IMUS:  Fine.   </p><p> DIETL: .it is based on fact.   </p><p> IMUS:  OK.    </p><p> MCCORD:  He just had a simple question.</p><p> IMUS:  I just wonder how you happened -- it happened to come to your  attention.  Who gave it to you, some friend of yours?   </p><p> DIETL:  He's a friend of Admiral Straw.</p><p> IMUS:  OK.</p><p> DIETL:  And I was at the Army-Navy game and he has a hat like you wear.   </p><p> IMUS:  That's not a hat like I wear.   </p><p> DIETL:  Well, it looks like some. </p><p> IMUS:  No, it's not.   </p><p> DIETL:  All right.  OK.  And he signed you the book, I'm going to tell you  about something, you talk about novel. </p><p> IMUS:  He signed the book to me because he wants me to plug the book.  </p><p> DIETL:  No, you don't have to.</p><p> IMUS:  Which I'm not now going to do, because I'm so offended that you  attacked me.   </p><p> DIETL:  I challenged you to read this Don, because it is based on the facts  about them taking over.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  I'm sure it's fine.</p><p> DIETL:  Taking over our country, stopping all our airlines, all our  aviation, all our grid, all of that.  And we talk about it all of the time.  </p><p> IMUS:  And your iPads all work...  </p><p> DIETL:  No.  No.  No.  I got the ones that Wi-Fi.  Do you got a Wi-Fi?  Can  you go on the train and catch a Wi-Fi in 3G?   </p><p> IMUS:  Yes.    </p><p> DIETL:  No, you can't.  That is 64 gigahertz.</p><p> IMUS:  Of course, why would I buy something else?   </p><p> DIETL:  Because they didn't have the 64.   </p><p> IMUS:  Of course they did.   </p><p> DIETL:  That was only 37.  </p><p> IMUS:  This is Wi-Fi, also AT&amp;T.  Coming up on 11 minutes until the hour.   Thank you.  Get out.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Now, looking at stocks here for you this morning, starting off  the new year, higher, a monthly survey in China showed manufacturing  slipped for the first time in five months there and that eased some  concerns that have been popping up about inflation, look at the European  markets, a live look there at Paris, it's up two percent, nearly.  Germany,  1.5 percent, London is closed today for a New Year's holiday and the  futures of the U.S., so far, Dow futures have been indicating a higher  open, 67 points higher at the moment.  </p><p> Now, moving onto your \"FOX Business Minute,\" many iPhone users getting some  extra sleep on New Year's day that they didn't want, there was a glitch in  the iPhone's alarm clock feature, users who you set their alarm for a  single wake-up found it didn't go off when 2011 arrived.  An Apple  spokesperson says, the fix is in the works and all alarms will work  properly starting today.  Users in Europe and Asia saying the problem has  not been fixed, however.  </p><p>Vizio, the maker of inexpensive flat screen TVs is looking to expand.   \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting the company wants to branch out into cell  phones and tablet computers, two products, the via phone and via tablet  will be introduced this summer, the announcement comes just days ahead of  the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas this week.  </p><p> And \"Little Fockers,\" holding on to the top spot at the weekend Box Office,  the movie bringing in just over $26 million this weekend, so it totals 103  million with no new movies now over New Year's weekend, the rest of the  line-up looks similar to last week, number two and three movies still \"True  Grit\" and \"Tron: Legacy.\"  </p><p> So, let's look at commodities here real quick for you, as we get back to  Imus, the gold price is at 1421 an ounce.  But look at oil, up again, $92  per barrel.  As the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right now, here  at FOX Business, giving you the power to prosper. </p><p> IMUS:  All right.  Coming up on five minutes until the hour here on the  IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  I was telling Charles Rangel and the Gangster  Mickey that I don't weigh myself very often, occasionally I do.  I weighed  myself this morning and I'm about, I'm not quite 6 feet tall and I weigh  153 pounds.  But because of the way I wear my wranglers, if I weigh 153  pounds and not 150 pounds, I can't get them on.  So, it was just my  struggle this morning.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  OK.  Jeff Greenfield.   </p><p> MCCORD:  A lot of issues.   </p><p> IMUS:  And Mary Matalin are both coming up, Gangster Mickey and Charles  Rangel, all that, just ahead.     </p><p> ANNOUNCER:  IMUS, IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN:  Hard to get on with the depends.   </p><p> IMUS:  What?   </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTLETT:  Hard to get on over the depends.  </p><p> IMUS:  What did you say?   </p><p> BARTLETT:  Hard to get on over the depends!  </p><p> IMUS:  Did I tell you what happened, I e-mail either one about Wyatt's  horse?   </p><p> BARTLETT:  No.   </p><p> IMUS:  Oh, God.  This is a horrible story.  At the ranch, he gets up at  5:00 in the morning, to go out at the barn with the cowboys, and they feed  all the animals.  Colder than hell, it's just miserable.  So, the Sunday  after Christmas, there wasn't anybody there, so he does it.  Even though  he's only 12, he can still drive the feed truck, I mean, so we bought him  his roping horse, buster, great roping horse, potentially great last  summer.  He goes up to the barn, he finds the horse dead in the stall.     </p><p> MCCORD:  Oh, no.   </p><p> IMUS:  The horse actually out in the run -- there's (inaudible) runs  outside the stall, some barns.  Anyway, the horse is on his back with his  leg stuck through the gate, dead.  So, he comes back, running down to the  house, screaming.  You can imagine.  His mother and I are asleep and I  couldn't, I thought it was one of the dogs have died, I couldn't imagine it  was his horse died.  So, we buried it and put a little note in with it and  oh, great. </p><p> MCCORD:  It's hard.   </p><p> IMUS:  Between the animals and I.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p> IMUS:  What did they -- hi, happy New Year.  What did they do when I was  gone, Connell?  Did you and Dagen fill in?</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  We did you know the old \"BEST OF IMUS\", had some live  guests and also tossed to some of your segments, so yes it was Dagen and --  and me.  We each took a couple days off around Christmas but we were both  here for some of the days.</p><p> IMUS:  You know actually, you guys are pretty good.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, thanks.  Seriously?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, why?</p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, I'm just trying to say do you really mean that?</p><p> IMUS:  Why you'd think we would have you on the program if we didn't think  you were good.</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's right.  That's true.</p><p> IMUS:  We could be wrong.</p><p> MCSHANE:  As I said to you in the e-mail, where would you be without me?   Now that the rating is coming up and everything -- </p><p> IMUS:  We'd be number one and not number two.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes exactly.</p><p> IMUS:  That where we would be.</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's -- that was your response.</p><p> IMUS:  Ok.  Jeff Greenfield of CBS News and Mary Matalin, is I know what  she's -- she's the former advisor to Darth Vader, Dick Cheney.  And that's  -- well, they are all coming up.</p><p> So -- anyway it's time for a little business news, and here to weary out  with that is Connell McShane.  Good morning, Connell.</p><p> MCSHANE:  I'll do my best.  Good morning, I-Man.</p><p> Now, the markets here real quick for you this morning are really --  actually looking pretty good to start off the New Year with a survey that  came out of China, that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in  five months, but that has eased some of the concerns about inflation over  there and markets around the world are higher.</p><p> We'll go to Asia, first of all and show that the Chinese market, the bottom  of the screen, the Shanghai composite was up one and three quarters percent  overnight; Hong Kong and South Korea -- those are the other markets on the  screen -- were also up; and Japan has not yet resumed trading for the New  Year.</p><p> In Europe this morning stocks are gaining ground; London is closed for a  New Year's holiday but Paris is up almost two percent -- it was up more  than percent earlier so it's off the highs; and Germany up by 1.3 percent.   So a pretty good start to the day.</p><p> Now, our futures in the U.S. indicating the open on Wall Street, in two- and-a-half hours could be higher.  We're up 64 points on DOW futures.  And  in terms of how we finished 2010, remember it was good year for stocks.  I  mean, the major indexes were higher, the DOW by 11 percent, the S&amp;P by  nearly 13 percent and the NASDAQ, the best of the bunch, up almost 17  percent in 2010.</p><p> Now when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California Congressman  Darrell Issa gets a big promotion.

And appearing on  Fox News Sunday over the weekend, Issa telling Chris Wallace he's going to  target government spending.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  We have about $1.7 trillion worth of  regulatory costs already in the government.  If the President wants to  throw another $300 billion or $400 billion, what he is doing is taking it  right out of businesses, right out of employment, right out of  competitiveness.  We need to make sure we can compete.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Now Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings, as  committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and  also, Medicare.</p><p> We're starting off the New Year with a busy week on the economic calendar  meantime.  Today we'll get readings on construction spending and  manufacturing.  And also this week, automakers reporting sales for December  and three jobs reports ahead of the Friday employment report from the Labor  Department.</p><p>Goldman Sachs investing $450 million in Facebook according to this  morning's \"New York Times\"; a Russian company also buying $50 million worth  of Facebook stock.  \"The Times\" says the deal's values Facebook at $50  billion.

Aren't they?</p><p> WOLF:  Oh terrible, change the rule.  Just because you win the division,  nothing, if you have a losing record, you're out and you are replaced by a  non-playoff team with the best record.</p><p> IMUS:  Why because the Giants are 10 -- 10-6.</p><p> WOLF:  Yes and as are the Buccaneers.</p><p> IMUS:  Right.</p><p> WOLF:  I mean, the point is you want the best teams in there -- who cares - - </p><p> IMUS:  Why are -- why are the Seahawks so awful?</p><p> WOLF:  Well, the quarterback is no great shakes any more, Hasselbeck.  The  best player is Leon Washington, the kickoff return man they got from the  Jets.  And they're in the worst division -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> WOLF:  -- in the NFL.</p><p> IMUS:  So Pete Carroll hasn't made any difference going there?</p><p> WOLF:  No not this year, but he'll say, we don't care, we won the division.</p><p> IMUS:  Right.  The fans -- or some of the fans did in a poll they took,  didn't want them to win.  Did you know that?</p><p> WOLF:  No, well they bet on the rain -- </p><p> IMUS:  Well, I don't know what the deal was.</p><p> All right, six minutes after the hour.  And for the millions of you who of  course can't function in life without knowing how I am -- </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  -- and -- and many of you who idolize me, which I -- I can  understand.</p><p> MCCORD:  Hell, the I-Man.</p><p> IMUS:  -- because people in this country no longer have any taste.  That's  the reason.  I'm more successful now than I have ever been.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCCORD:  And demonstrated by the ratings.</p><p> IMUS:  Which -- which demonstrates the clear decline of our society as we  know it.</p><p> MCCORD:  Oh yes.</p><p> IMUS:  But I had this biopsy on the 17th of December and that is why I was  not here so, to determine if in fact these things I had on my vocal cord  were cancerous.  And apparently they are not.</p><p> MCCORD:  Good.</p><p> IMUS:  But I had it over at Mt. Sinai but Dr. Wu did the biopsy.  He's a  great surgeon, doctor, and another guy who is fabulous, is a -- is a guy by  the name of Dr. Allen Reid, who is an anesthesiologist.  Fabulous.</p><p> And you know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and -- and -- and also Cornell,  but Mt. Sinai is a great hospital, starting with the nurses.  And it was  under general anesthesia, and what apparently I have are pre-cancerous  cells.  But -- but I got to thinking about it, all cells are pre-cancerous,  aren't they, but some are farther along the road than others.</p><p> MCCORD:  Certainly.</p><p> IMUS:  So the ones that I have are as far along the road as you want them  to get.</p><p> MCCORD:  Before getting rid of them.</p><p> IMUS:  Before getting rid of them.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  So now they have to go on with the laser and laser them off.</p><p> MCCORD:  \"Star Wars\" them off there like that.</p><p> IMUS:  And which is according to Dr. Wu, who is a -- who is peek-a-boo Wu,  who is fabulous by the way.  It's an office thing, so -- apparently, I know  that is too much information for you.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes it is.</p><p> IMUS:  Apparently, I'm fine.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  And my voice is a little hoarse, but -- </p><p> MCCORD:  Not horrible.</p><p> IMUS:  Not horrible.</p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  Here's Chuck with the news.  Good morning, Charles.</p><p> MCCORD:  Good morning, I-Man.</p><p> Horrible weather out west, main highway between southern and central  California shut down in both directions blowing snow and ice and other big  storms making driving conditions, treacherous.  The grapevine area of I-5  closed indefinitely right now after cars began slipping and sliding all  over the place.  One driver says it was in fact pretty bad.</p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We found out about 15 minutes after I passed the  detour, so I could have saved myself a lot of time, but instead we spent an  hour-and-a-half of gridlock and now we have to go right back where we came  from, so I'm feeling a little silly about that.</p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> MCCORD:  Winds were gusting to 90 miles an hour.  In mountain areas, snow  accumulating at elevations as low as 1,500 feet as the area continues to  suffer from the winter.</p><p> And the President in Hawaii, quietly signing the bill yesterday, that  provides aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks, all the first responders,  who became so sickened after working in the toxicity of Ground Zero.  New  York Senator Chuck Schumer worked hard to get the bill passed.</p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  It's been a long and arduous journey and  lots of us played a role, but the real credit goes to those first  responders.</p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> MCCORD:  The President signed the measure privately in Hawaii and issued a  statement praising as he put it, \"The selfless courage demonstrated by the  firefighters, police officers and first responders who risked their lives\".</p><p> The bill provides $4.2 billion in aid to sickened workers and a few hundred  people who live near the burning pile at the Ground Zero, the Trade Center  site.</p><p> Jerry Brown, being sworn in as the Governor of California today, replacing  Governor Schwarzenegger; the ceremony takes place, downtown Sacramento this  morning with a reception scheduled then for late this afternoon.</p><p> Top Democrats says the President will work -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Reception.</p><p> MCCORD:  Reception.  Yes sir.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, why would they be having a reception?</p><p> MCCORD:  Well, it's a big deal.</p><p> IMUS:  Spend money on that.</p><p> MCCORD:  That's a good point.  Why -- why and in that state -- </p><p> IMUS:  Aren't they about $90 trillion in debt?</p><p> MCCORD:  I think, $96 trillion, in the last -- in the last estimate.  But  you're absolutely right.</p><p> IMUS:  What a mess.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCGUIRK:  It will be bring your own booze and crackers.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes and brown bag in it.</p><p> IMUS:  Well -- </p><p> MCCORD:  And the top Democrat says the President will work with the  Republican Congress but don't -- that doesn't mean he's going to buckle to  them.  Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine saying that there  will be disagreements.</p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> TIM KAINE, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  If the Republicans are  willing to work as they did at the end of that lame duck session I think we  will see productive efforts in a number of ways.</p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> MCCORD:  Kaine pointed to recent compromises on tax cuts, and this new  START treaty as proof of the possibility at least of some demonstration of  bipartisanship.</p><p> And researchers are making progress on a blood test that is interesting, to  say the least.  They say this will be able to spot a single cancer cell  among as many as a billion healthy ones.  The health care company, Johnson  &amp; Johnson, the giant company says it will join scientists at Massachusetts  General Hospital where the test was invented, to try to bring this thing to  market within the next several years.</p><p> Researchers think the test has the potential at least to transform care of  many types of cancer, especially breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer.   Doctors hope to use it to determine what treatment would be best for any  particular tumor or set of tumors.</p><p> Magnitude 7.1 earthquake, southern Chile, yesterday, prompted tens of  thousands to flee the coast for higher ground thinking that it might be  generating another tsunami like the one that ravaged the area last year.   There were no reports, though, of deaths, no tsunami alert was actually  issued.</p><p> A statement with the geological survey says the epicenter was about 45  miles away from the provincial capital of Temuco (ph) the population of  about a quarter million people.</p><p> IMUS:  You know the thing is around the world.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  And some of these various people like in Chile who already got  screwed in the -- in the genetic lottery.  Well, not the genetic lottery,  but the geographical lottery -- </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  -- by -- and then have to endure this.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Like Haiti, for example.</p><p> MCCORD:  Oh.</p><p> IMUS:  And Africa and -- these various places around the world, just get --  but just get screwed by one hideous catastrophe after another.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  It is 13 after the hour; Warner, do you have sports?</p><p> WOLF:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Ok.  We'll get to that in a second first, let's check the business  news and with that, Connell McShane.  Good morning, Connell.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Ok, good morning, I-Man.</p><p> The market coming up at 11 percent gain in 2010 at least for the DOW and  nearly 17 percent rise for the NASDAQ, up again this morning indicating the  New Year will start off on a good note.</p><p> Then, there's a big story in the \"New York Times\" this morning about  Facebook, Goldman Sachs making a $500 million investment in Facebook  according to \"The Times\" and a Russian investor also making a sizable  investment and so the -- the value of Facebook according to these  investments would now be around $50 billion.</p><p> So Facebook would be worth more as \"The Times\" points out, than big tech  companies like eBay and Yahoo! and many others, but anyway, Facebook which  has obviously been a hot company for some time is getting a big investment  now from the -- one of the best known firms on -- or the best known firm on  Wall Street, Goldman Sachs.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  And the -- the two twins from Harvard who are -- the rowing twins  out there in San Diego.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  -- who are suing what's his name?</p><p> MCSHANE:  Zuckerberg.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes they must be happy about this latest development.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, we'll see.  Well, they want -- they want their suit, they  settled it already for tens of millions of dollars but they want it now to  be thrown out so that their shares can be valued higher but Facebook has  won every legal challenge of that case which is of course the subject of  the movie, the \"Social Network\".</p><p> IMUS:  Well, the Connell McShane business report sponsored by Gorilla  Trades.  Get powerful stock picks for 30 days, sign up now at  GorillaTrades.com.  It's 14 after the hour.</p><p> Well, Charles had reported that the 9/11 responder bill was signed and \"The  New York Times\" had what I thought was kind of an amusing article,  particularly for those of us who are fans of Jon Stewart.  I suspect Mr.  Stewart probably thought it was amusing as well, but Bill Carter who writes  all of these books about the late night wars as though somebody cares --  judging by the best-seller list, no one does.</p><p> Compared Mr. Stewart to Everett R. Murrow, which because of Mr. Stewart's  rants about the Republicans, who wouldn't support the 9/11 responders bill  and which I thought he was right about.  But, I thought what made the  Republicans come around, of course, Bernie's now claiming that they were  able to get $3 billion out of the bill, so that they were -- so that they  would pass it.  But, whether they would have got that out or not, they were  shamed into passing it.</p><p> But I thought when Shep Smith from Fox News was on Fox News, of course.   And he had seen the Jon Stewart Show the night before.  And so he was  talking about it.  And when -- he did this spontaneous wrap about how  shameful it was that the Republicans were dragging their feet, refusing to  pass the bill, and I saw him when he did it.  And it appeared to be  spontaneous but, in my view, the Republicans watching this could have  endured Jon Stewart ragging on them and would have, because it happens all  the time. </p><p> But, boy, I would be willing to bet when they turned on Fox News with the  huge audience that they have and here's Shep Smith with his -- huge  audience that he has.  And they lost him, then they've lost the fight.   Here's Shep Smith.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Last night on Jon Stewart -- it was Jon  Stewart's last show of the week and ok, we watched it, whatever.  And he  just flat on -- absolutely right and it's worth saying, who's going to hold  these people's feet to the fire when we're able to put a 52-story building  down there so far at Ground Zero.</p><p> We're able to pay for tax cuts from billionaires who don't need them and  it's not going to stimulate the economy but we can't give health care to  Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire?  Went down there  to save people?</p><p> Did people know what the city was like that day; people walking over  bridges, they were covered in ash.  They were running for their lives.   They were crying.  Their family members were dead and these people ran to  Ground Zero to save people's lives.  And we're not going to give them  medicine for the illnesses they got down there?</p><p> It is disgusting, it's a national disgrace.  It's a shame and everybody who  voted against it should have to stand up and account for him or herself.   Is anybody going to hold them accountable?  </p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I think you just did.  </p><p> SMITH:  I'm not really in a position to do that.  I mean I think I just  kind of went out there and said what the truth is.  And I feel like, I feel  like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people.</p><p> There was no warning label on Ground Zero, on 9/11 that these substances  will kill you.  And even if there had been they would have gone anyway.   They just need a little bit of help.</p><p> It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things.  We spend a lot  more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do, doing  anything for those people, don't we?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IMUS:  That is Shep Smith, Fox News.  That is big time -- tell me about Fox  News.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  With Chris Wallace.  </p><p> IMUS:  Yes.  Well, he's just sitting there, sucking his thumb -- </p><p> MCGUIRK:  You had brought that up with Chris Wallace prior to that  conversation and then that following Sunday, Chris Wallace brought it up to  several politician on his program as well.  </p><p> IMUS:  That is big time, Shep Smith.  You know, and all the Lobster  Newburghs of the world.  Those of you who run around and won't watch Fox  News -- </p><p> MCCORD:  Pay attention.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, pay attention.  They're not doing that -- I didn't see Diane  Sawyer doing that.  I didn't see that wimp, who by the way won't be in the  \"Profiles in Courage\" book, Brian Williams.  I didn't see him or the little  rodent over there at CBS doing anything.</p><p> Did you?  Did you see any of them?  Did they have a word to say about that?   Who did have a word to say about it?  Shep Smith.</p><p> So -- 19 after the hour.  Get to Warner in sports in a minute.  Calm down.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  In the news this morning, Expedia dropping American Airlines  fares from its Web site.  It's the latest development in this conflict that  has been growing between the airlines and on-line travel agencies since  American cut ties with Orbitz.  The airline says Expedia intentionally  listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.</p><p> American is looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own Web sites  in an effort to save money.  Expedia says the move will only cost them  ticket sales and believes American's efforts are bad for travelers.  Well,  there you have it.</p><p> Stocks starting off the New Year with some gains here after a monthly  survey in China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five  months and that's worked to ease some inflation concerns.</p><p> Over in Europe this morning, stocks are higher and London is closed for a  New Year's holiday but both Paris and Frankfurt are gaining ground.</p><p> Our futures are also higher, ahead of the open on Wall Street which is  coming a little over two hours from now.  We're up 67 points on Dow  futures.</p><p> And commodities, oil is up at $92 a barrel; and gold down, just slightly.</p><p> So, that's a look at some of your top stories and now over to Charles for  more of this morning's top stories.  </p><p> MCCORD:  And they include today, Connell, this -- another big storm hitting  southern California; snow and 90 mile-an-hour winds were reported in some  locations and authorities have shut done the so-called grapevine portion of  I-5, north of Los Angeles.</p><p> President Obama signing into law the measure that passes -- that pays,  rather, for medical care for first responders to the 9/11 terror attacks,  New York, '01.  The legislation sets up this $4 billion compensation fund  to help those people.</p><p> And a top navy officer under fire for producing and appearing in a series  of raunchy orientation videos, broadcast to nearly 6,000 crewmembers of the  USS Enterprise.  In the videos Captain Owen Honors and other crewmembers  can be seen cursing and using anti-gay slurs among other things.</p><p> Those are some of the headlines as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program  continues now right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p> IMUS:  Twenty-five after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.   It's a prime example Bernard, of what I was talking to you about off the  air.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p> IMUS:  Idiot sales department (INAUDIBLE) -- they're all talking about it  now.  They write these commercials and the commercials are 90 seconds long,  but they pay for 60 seconds.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.  </p><p> IMUS:  So I read for 60 seconds and then I stop reading so I don't know  what they want left in or out or who knows.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Essential information, right.  </p><p> IMUS:  And I want to help them out, one of them is for GNC, it's a great  nutrition center, they're great.</p><p> I have no idea what they -- by the way, at this point if they're not on top  of it and the stupid sales department at the radio station is not, then, I  can't be worried about it.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Too much.  </p><p> IMUS:  And now I've got myself all worked up here and I was doing fine up  to now.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.  </p><p> IMUS:  All right.  Time for sports and here with that is the great Warner  Wolf.  Good morning, Warner.  </p><p> WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Good morning.  Thank you, I-man.</p><p> Well, completing the play-off picture last night, the Seahawks finishing 7- 9, beat the Rams 16-6; they win the NFC west.  And as you said, even the  Seattle fans wanted the Seahawks to lose so they would get a higher draft  pick.</p><p> The Packers win the wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3.   The Colts win  the AFC south, beating the Titans, 23-20.  Although they didn't know it at  the time, they had already won it minutes earlier because the Jags lost.   Steelers win the AFC.  Falcons win the NFC. </p><p> And finally, I-man, MVP, there's going to be no question about it, Tom  Brady finishes with 36 touchdowns and just four interceptions.</p><p> IMUS:  How did he play -- he's playing better than he ever has.  </p><p> WOLF:  Ever, all-time.  Not anytime.  </p><p> IMUS:  No.  </p><p> WOLF:  Not every time -- </p><p> IMUS:  That will be fine.</p><p> WOLF:  Not Greenwich Time.  </p><p> IMUS:  That will be fine.  Time for a little business news now, oh, my God.   And here with that is the girl with the purple dress on, purple rain,  purple rain.  Dagen McDowell -- good morning Dagen.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, sir.  I was trying to get  all gussied up for your return.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, I'm glad you did.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  At least I came back from Christmas with all my teeth  because there's always that danger.  </p><p> IMUS:  How would you lose your teeth?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A fight, fall down or there's always that, you know, peanut  brittle sitting around the house.  </p><p> IMUS:  Or Santa come down that chimney and you're there under the tree and  haven't been rubbing that Chamonix on yourself and so Santa would be  disappointed, wouldn't he?  And look like you been left out in the rain,  girl.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He would punch me -- would punch me in the mouth.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, let's hope not.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  For not keeping my skin soft and supple.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, anyway, what's going on.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right.  The movie business was boo -- bad last year.   Overall attendance was down more than 5 percent; the lowest number of  tickets sold to the movies since 1996.  Now, total revenue was north of $10  billion because ticket prices are higher.  People are going to 3-D movies,  which cost more money, but one, one notable disappointment was that Johnny  Depp-Angelina Jolie movie \"The Tourist\" at end of the year.  So, I reckon  paying have gotten tired of paying to see that hussy with the puffy lips  stand around.  </p><p> IMUS:  Why are you offing (ph) on her.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why?</p><p> IMUS:  You don't like her -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't.  No, not at all.</p><p> IMUS:  You know who seems kind of cute is Reese Witherspoon.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, that movie didn't do so well either; that new movie that  she's in.  </p><p> IMUS:  She's going to marry her agent, you know.  Did you know that?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes, I did.  Jim Toff (ph) is his name, by the way.  </p><p> IMUS:  And how about Shania Twain?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Getting married to the ex-husband of the woman that Mutt Lang,  Shania's ex-husband, left her for.  Yes. </p><p> IMUS:  Now, that's a trailer park -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> RUFINO:  I'm my own grandpa right there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you know what?  That's why you got to love her.</p><p> IMUS:  Really?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  All's well that ends well.  She grew up hard knocks, man.   Now she's found love.</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, I know she did.  Yes.  I thought she's good.  I've always liked  her, but the girl -- she married Mutt Lange who produced all her records.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  And he -- didn't he produce Def Leppard for a long time?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, he did.</p><p> IMUS:  OK.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And Foreigner.</p><p> IMUS:  Foreigner.  So he's a great record producer.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  But apparently that wasn't enough and she wasn't enough.  So he was  having an affair with her assistant, right, or his assistant.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  She was like the house manager, I thought, something  like that.</p><p> IMUS:  OK.  And so, Shania, of course, found out about it.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And it was Shania's best friend.</p><p> IMUS:  And Shania's best friend.  Sure.</p><p> CHARLES MCCORD:  Oh, man.</p><p> IMUS:  So he was always there, that's unfortunate.  So now, are they  married now?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't know if they're married.</p><p> IMUS:  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Now, but that woman's ex-husband, they are married, OK.  Mutt  and the woman -- Mutt and the woman are married and the woman's ex-husband  just married Shania.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I feel dizzy right now.</p><p> MCCORD:  Oh, man.</p><p> IMUS:  Now, Shania, she's down in Nashville.  There's a bunch of people  available, a bunch of these good looking cowboy singers.  And I just, I  just didn't understand that.  That's sort of screwed up, isn't it?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, he's hot.</p><p> IMUS:  He is?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The guy she married is smoking, yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, he is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's like -- yes, he's European looking.  He's --</p><p> IMUS:  He's cute?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, all right.  Well, never mind.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And those cowboys will cheat on you quicker than they'll sneeze,  so why drive down that road again?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, Mutt Lange is not a cowboy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know, but the cowboys will cheat, too.  Find a man who will  stay honest to you.</p><p> IMUS:  Like Tim McGraw, he married, down the road with what's her name.   Figure, well, why not, so.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What a tough decision for him.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Faith Hill or hmmm -- I wonder --</p><p> IMUS:  Years ago -- years ago, my brother and Phil Sweet wrote a song  called \"\"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You, which eventually went to number  one.  It won the Music City News Record of the Year, country record, and is  recorded by Jim Ed Brown of The Browns, you know.  And Helen Cornelius.</p><p> Now, Helen, she was married.  Well, you know where this story is going.   And so was Jim, he was married.  But they get this big hit record \"I Don't  Want to Have to Marry You\", I don't want to have to say I do.  And so  they're on tour and they're on the bus and they discovered some -- one of  them, one of the husbands or either her husband or his wife discovered that  between the two compartments on the bus where Jim Ed Brown would sleep and  where the other compartment where old Helen was asleep, there was a trap  door.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCCORD:  No way.</p><p> IMUS:  There's like a, where your dog comes in and out.  So one of them was  wiggling through the trap door.</p><p> MCCORD:  Oh, for crying out loud.</p><p> IMUS:  I don't want to have to marry you.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.  I don't have to go through that trap door.</p><p> IMUS:  Man, oh, man.</p><p> All right, 33 after the hour.  Jeff Greenfield is coming up.  But first,  time for a briefing sponsored by our friends at P.C. Richard &amp; Son.  And  here with that is Bernard McGuirk.</p><p> Good morning, Bernie.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Yo, chief.  Well, a lot happened since the break began for us a  couple of weeks ago.  The Bush tax cuts extended, \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\"  repealed.  The death panels are back and Obamacare and the blizzard of 2010  further revealed Mayor Mike Bloomberg could be the arrogant schmuck we all  knew he was.</p><p> IMUS:  Two best news.  The \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and the 9/11 responder  bill.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes.  That was signed just yesterday by the president in Hawaii,  robbing Chuck Schumer of his moment in the spotlight.  He couldn't be there  at the signing.  However, before all this happened, Larry King signed off  and during that show, a funny thing happened while Larry King was  interviewing Bill Clinton which pretty much went unnoticed.  They were  talking about both being heart surgeon patients, members of the \"zipper  club\" but that was a little confusing.  But here it is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VOICE OF: LARRY KING, HOST, \"LARRY KING LIVE\":  You look well fit.  Are you  feeling well?</p><p> VOICE OF: BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I feel great.   I've been traveling quite a bit, but as you pointed out I just got back  from Haiti.  And I'm kind of like you, I have to keep working.  I don't  know if it keeps me young, but at least it keeps me out of the grave.</p><p> KING:  We're both in the \"zipper club.\" By the way, the suits want me to  remind you what the \"zipper club\" is.  It's if you've had open heart  surgery, they have to zipper it up.  So I thought everyone in the world  knew it but apparently --</p><p> CLINTON:  I'm glad you clarified that.</p><p> KING:  I see what you mean.  Oh, oh.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCGUIRK:  The big dog acknowledging and can be self-deprecating at this  point.</p><p> IMUS:  Of course, we lost a character when Larry -- what's Larry going to  do now?</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Well, he's still going to work.  He's going to be a contributor.</p><p> He better, right.  He has to be.</p><p> IMUS:  Wasn't he ragging on Hannity and Rachel Maddow?</p><p> MCGUIRK:  He did somewhere.  I read something about that.  He was --</p><p> IMUS:  Both of them were kicking his ass, by the way.  Hannity by a lot and  her by some.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  So --</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Hannity drove Larry King off the air, essentially.</p><p> IMUS:  So he gets on.  He's bad-mouthing Rachel Maddow and Hannity who were  both killing him.</p><p> All right, Greenfield is next.  Twenty-five until the hour.</p><p> MUSIC:  Oh, I love the clothes she wears and the way the sunlight plays  upon her hair.  Oh, I hear the sound of a church bell off the wind that  lifts her perfume through the air.  I'm picking up good vibrations.  She's  giving me the excitations.  I'm picking up good vibrations.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I'm so irritable this morning that I just don't know if I can  recover.</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  The bailout program for boring radio.</p><p> IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a business  update from the FOX Business Network.  Here's Connell McShane.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  All right.  Here's  your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p> As many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's day,  there was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock features.  Users have set  their alarm for a single wakeup.  Found it didn't go off when 2011 arrived.   An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all alarms will work  properly starting today.  But apparently users in Europe and Asia say they  are still having some problems.</p><p>Vizio, the maker of inexpensive flat-screen TVs looking now to expand.  The  \"Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell  phones and tablet computers.  The two products, the Via Phone and the Via  Tablet will be introduced this summer from the company.  The announcement  comes days ahead of the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.</p><p> As for the markets this morning, let's check in on the futures once again.   They've been higher all morning long.  Dow futures now up by 84 points as  IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p> SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning.  I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan  from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast.</p><p> You can see we do still have rain showers here in the southwest and snow  showers in the higher elevations.  Most of the U.S. is looking very clear.   And as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers  and some rain showers in New England along the coastline.  The midsection,  lots of sunshine.  A slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis.  And as we  look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're  going to see very many if any delays travel-wise because of the weather,  other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to that rain- snow mix.</p><p> I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program on the FOX Business  Network. </p><p>  IMUS:  All right.  Nineteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Mary Matlin is coming up.  Tomorrow, Tom Friedman.  And then on  Wednesday, Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus, \"Blond on Blond.\"  This portion of  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by Time Warner cable business  class.  You first, the technology follows.</p><p> Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from CBS News, Jeff  Greenfield.  Good morning, Mr. Greenfield.</p><p> JEFF GREENFIELD, CBS NEWS (via telephone):  Good morning, Don.  Happy New  Year.</p><p> IMUS:  Happy New Year to you.  I apologize for being late.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  You know, it's -- I mean, I would not have missed the  conversation about all those country stars and their lives for anything.   So it was fine, you know?</p><p> IMUS:  I sense a note of sarcasm in your voice.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  No.  Me, on this show?  Don't be silly.</p><p> IMUS:  It just hurts my feelings because --</p><p> GREENFIELD:  No, you are the audio version of Oprah's new network.  Nothing  but good feelings.</p><p> IMUS:  I wonder how that's going to work out for her.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  You know, I don't know.  It's in a way unprecedented that an  entire network is built around the appeal of one person although she's  hardly, you know, your ordinary figure.  And I guess it involves everything  from whether or not some of her viewers are going to want to pay the extra  fee.  She's not on pay cable, but on a lot of network, a lot of cable  systems she's not on the basic cable.  There is some fluff about that.  And  the real question is, I guess, can you sustain 24 hours based on the world  view of one person although as I say in her case that's just one  extraordinary media figure.  I mean, she certainly has built something over  the years that is just unprecedented in, you know, media.  So good luck to  her.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, I like her.  I don't know why I like her.  I don't watch her  show, I just like her.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  She's a -- I can say -- I think, I think you don't connect at  that level with so many people at that level of intensity unless there's  something there, you know.</p><p> IMUS:  Maybe Barbara Walters should have asked her if she was a lesbian?</p><p> GREENFIELD:  I don't know, Don.  Let me take that under prayerful  consideration.</p><p> IMUS:  I wonder what you thought.  I didn't so, I like Barbara Walters,  too.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  Well, OK.</p><p> IMUS:  So the 9/11 responders bill is signed that finally, huh?</p><p> GREENFIELD:  Yes, and I think you were very wise in showing that clip from  Shep Smith, because I think between him and Stuart, you had -- I think Shep  is a straight arrow newscaster, but certainly the FOX Network is watched  overwhelmingly by folks of a conservative persuasion and Stuart's show is  watched overwhelmingly by folks with a liberal persuasion.  When you have  people on both sides coming at that issue and basically saying shame to the  people who voted against it, I think those twin factors played a big role  in getting that bill through.</p><p> IMUS:  Do you know if many Democrats watch FOX News somewhere?</p><p> GREENFIELD:  No, they do, because, first of all, FOX News as a cable  network is by far the most watched cable network, and it isn't that  Democrats don't watch it. But in the surveys that I have seen over the  years and it shouldn't surprise anybody, the predominantly majority view of  those who watch tends to the right.  It's just the predominant view of  those who watch MSNBC tends to the left.  And this is about reassurance and  reaffirmation of what you believe is right.</p><p> I may have told you the story.  I talked once to a Democratic senator who  told me that the television set is always on at MSNBC at home.  And I said  why after 12 hours of debate in the Senate, you go home and watch more  politics?  And the answer was, it's like soaking in a nice warm bath, you  know.  And I think that's true for a lot of people who turn on a cable news  network, that basically tells them what you basically think that's right.   And I think it's one of the reasons why my former places of business, CNN,  had such a prime time ratings.  There are a lot of others, but people  basically I think, that is to say the people who watch cable news, and  remember it's a big minority of television viewers.  You're talking about  three percent of, you know, television homes.  Folks turn that stuff on  either to be told they're right or in the case of, you know, Democrats  watching FOX or Republicans watching MSNBC to get the blood going.</p><p> IMUS:  I was so happy we were able to get you away from CNN over to CBS.  I  can't tell you.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  Well, I'm sure you played your part.</p><p> IMUS:  I hated the fact.  Well, I kept saying to Rick Kaplan, who was a big  fan of yours, by the way, as are a lot of people.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  He's now one of my bosses.  He's the executive producer of  Katie Couric's show.</p><p> IMUS:  Why wouldn't you be -- why wouldn't we get Greenfield over to CBS  News and get him out of that hell hole over there.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  The only thing I can tell you is the cafeteria at CNN was much  better than the cafeteria at CBS.</p><p> IMUS:  Did you watch the Rose Bowl?</p><p> GREENFIELD:  I did, that's my alma mater.</p><p> IMUS:  That's what I asked.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  I thought it was a really good game.  I was the only big 10  team that was competitive I think in all those -- how many bowl games are  there now?  About 35 quite literally?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  So it's one missed field goal.</p><p> IMUS:  That was my only connection to the game is I knew that you had gone  to school there before you went to Harvard or Yale, wherever the hell you  went.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  Yes, right.</p><p> IMUS:  And that they were playing TCU.  Of course, I was rooting for TCU,  but that's just because I'm a big Texas fan.  So --</p><p> GREENFIELD:  Well, Bob Schieffer is.  In fact, I regretted the fact that he  and I didn't get a bet down.  Although now that Wisconsin lost, I don't  know would have had to -- I don't know what I would have had to do, you  know, appeared on the air in a TCU warm-up jacket.  I guess that was a  really good game and I must say that, you know, I didn't, I didn't call the  University of Wisconsin in high dungeon and say no more contributions from  me because you lost the football game.  That's perhaps taking it a bit too  far.</p><p> IMUS:  If you're one of the people like I am who thinks that Sarah Palin is  -- I don't know if I think she's a dope or not, but whatever.  But let me  ask you this, how much worse off would the country or better off would the  country be where she president? </p><p> GREENFIELD:  You know what?</p><p> IMUS:  The answer is not --</p><p> GREENFIELD:  First of all -- no, first, she's dumb like a fox.  I mean,  here's somebody who's turned the governorship of Alaska and an unsuccessful  bid for vice-president into a multi-million dollar empire where she gets to  talk only to people who like her for $100,000 a more pop, you know, is a  favorite on the most watched cable news network in the country and makes  millions of dollars selling books.  This is how dumb she is.</p><p> IMUS:  Very good.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  Yes, that's --</p><p> Two Cadillacs outside.</p><p> IMUS:  You remember.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking of when people talk  about how dumb he is, that preacher guy.</p><p> One of my favorite routines.  But you know, that's a question probably  better asked to people who -- who would ideologically tend to be on her  side.  I think it's really interesting that either a majority or maybe  close to of Republicans don't think she's qualified to be president.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  So what she has is an enormously intensely loyal base of  people who like her and think any criticism of her is just an example of  left wing media bias.</p><p> IMUS:  Maybe it's a little like Oprah.  We all like her but we just don't  want her to run anything.</p><p> All right.  I've got to go, but thank you very much.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  -- that analogy completely, but I do think that she's going to  have a significant role whether she's a candidate or not in 2012.</p><p> IMUS:  All right.  I've got to go.</p><p> GREENFIELD:  OK.  Well, Happy New Year and it's two months to start  plugging my book like a banshee (ph).</p><p> IMUS:  I will do anything for you.  Jeff Greenfield, CBS News.</p><p> MUSIC:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  The stocks starting  off the new year with some gains here.  The monthly survey coming out of  China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and  that actually is easing some inflation concerns and some optimism about our  economy as well, ahead of some key economic data points later in the week.   Europe is up across the board.  London is closed today for the New Year's  holiday.  And our futures are up across the board.  The Dow futures ahead  of the open on Wall Street now up almost triple digits.  So we're adding to  the gains as we get closer to the open.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants  to put on the market.

We haven't lost  Larry King?</p><p> ROB BARTLETT:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  So this is pathetic.</p><p> BARTLETT:  Why?</p><p> IMUS:  Can't you come up with something else?  You're a professional  comedian.</p><p> BARTLETT:  I happen to come up with something else.  He's a great  character.  You don't want to lose him.</p><p> MCCORD:  He's still going to be around doing specials and stuff.  He's just  not going to have a show.</p><p> TONY POWELL:  You're going to make him to do whatever --</p><p> BARTLETT:  We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p> IMUS:  What?</p><p> BARTLETT:  We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, yes, but that's different.</p><p> MCCORD:  That's Nixon.</p><p> POWELL:  Yes, it's Nixon.</p><p> IMUS:  It's Nixon.</p><p> MCCORD:  No, but you --</p><p> IMUS:  You're saying we can still do Larry King?</p><p> BARTLETT:  Why not?  It's not like he's dead.</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, yes, he is.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCCORD:  But that's been for a while.</p><p> IMUS:  He's a no-good bastard, by the way.</p><p> MCCORD:  Who?</p><p> IMUS:  Larry King.

So I say to  Carly, I want a -- I'm drinking this tea that is supposed to kill cancer  cells.</p><p> MCCORD: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: So -- and I'm happy to do it. So I said I wanted another cup. So she  just brings over an empty cup, you know -- </p><p> MCSHANE: Good for her. You deserve that. </p><p> IMUS: But I -- because I didn't specify what I wanted.</p><p> MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: But it turns out we're out of the tea, so -- anyway, Seahawks won the  football game last night, in case you just turned your -- whatever you have  on, on. Your toaster.</p><p> MCSHANE: Your toaster.</p><p> IMUS: And -- </p><p> MCSHANE: Seven and nine in the playoffs. </p><p> IMUS: Yes, which doesn't make any sense to me, but I don't care. So, are  you a football fan, Connell. </p><p> MCSHANE: No, I'm a Jet fan. I was at the Jet game yesterday with my son and  it was fun. And they won their -- well, they were already in the playoffs,  but they won. So they go 11-5. </p><p> IMUS: Why would you pick a game to go to that meant nothing? </p><p> MCSHANE: Because you know why -- that's actually a good point. But we  hadn't been to a game at the new stadium yet. So I decided on Saturday, the  weather wasn't going to be too cold and he had never been to a game at the  new stadium, so let's go. So we went. </p><p> IMUS: What kind of seats did you have? </p><p> MCSHANE: We had good seats. We were right behind -- they were actually in  the second row -- they were technically in the 11th row but they were right  behind the tunnel, you know, where the players run in. So they were in the  second row behind that tunnel in the end zone and three of the touchdowns  were right in our end zone, right where we were sitting. So it was pretty  cool. </p><p> IMUS: Did you buy the tickets? </p><p> MCSHANE: Yes, I bought them on -- I just bought them on Stub Hub the day  before the game, online. </p><p> IMUS: Wouldn't there be some way, if you were going to go, you could -- you  could let me know and then we could call Warner -- </p><p> MCSHANE: Right. </p><p> IMUS: And have you sit in the box with the owner? </p><p> MCSHANE: You know what, but then I'd owe you something. </p><p> IMUS: You owe me a lot now, by the way, (INAUDIBLE). </p><p> MCSHANE: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. </p><p> IMUS: It's time for a little business news now and here is Connell McShane. </p><p> Good morning, Connell.</p><p> MCSHANE: I didn't want to add to it. </p><p> Good morning, I-man.</p><p> Now, let's look at the markets here this morning to see how things are  starting off the week. Stocks -- starting off the year, really. It's the  first trading day of the year with some gains. There's a monthly survey out  of China that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five  months, and that's easing concerns about inflation. If you look at Asia,  for example, the Shanghai composite, the Chinese market at the bottom of  the screen, up 1.75 percent. Kospi in South Korea, Hang Seng in Hong Kong  all up on the day. Japan has not yet resumed trading in the new year. </p><p> In Europe, stocks are up. London's close also today because of the New  Year's holiday. Paris is up 2 percent. Look at that. Germany up 1.3  percent. And our futures indicating the open on Wall Street in an hour and  a half is going to be significantly higher. Dow futures up almost triple  digits, up 92 points.</p><p> All right. Now, in terms of how we fared last year, as it is, in 2010,  there's the recap. The Dow up 11 percent. The S&amp;P almost 13 percent. And  the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, higher by almost 17 percent.</p><p> The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on even  more debt. The national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion  ceiling. White House Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Austan Goolsbee  on ABC \"This Week\" saying it's crucial that ceiling is raised. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: This is not a  game. You know, the debt ceiling is not -- is not something to toy with.  That's the -- the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that's the -- essentially  defaulting on our obligations, which is totally unprecedented in American  history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree that it needs to be raised, but many are  also saying they wouldn't go along with that unless they get promises to  change Washington's spending habits. They argue there's no point in even  having a debt ceiling if it's simply raised every time the national debt  gets close. </p><p>Bank of America taking a $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter. It's  related to mortgages sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bank making  the payment to Fannie and Freddie as part of a settlement over mortgages  sold by Countrywide Financial. Now, Bank of America, remember, bought  Countrywide three years ago and Bank of America shares are actually rising  this morning on the news. </p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants  to put in the open -- on the market. Now, the blood test is billed as being  able to spot a single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells. J&amp;J is  teaming with the scientists who invented the test to make it cheaper and  better. The hope is that the blood tests can take the place of more  invasive cancer tests. </p><p> And many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day.  There was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock feature. Users who set their  alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't even -- it didn't go off when  2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all  alarms, they say, will be working properly starting today. </p><p> As for commodities this morning, the oil price has been up above $92 a  barrel and is higher than that now as well. $1,423 or thereabouts for gold.  Up $2 after being lower earlier. </p><p> Mary Matalin coming up a little bit later this hour with the I-man as IMUS  IN THE MORNING continues right now here at Fox Business, giving you the  power to prosper. </p><p> ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING. </p><p> IMUS: I can't hear you. (INAUDIBLE) here. What's the matter with you?</p><p> It is five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Mary Matalin is coming up. </p><p> Well, I can't hear you. We're trying to -- we're sitting here talking about  the guy who does the \"Red Eye\" show on the Fox News Channel. It's on at  3:00 a.m. Gary -- </p><p> MCGUIRK: Greg.</p><p> IMUS: Gray --</p><p> MCGUIRK: Gutfield.</p><p> IMUS: Gutfield.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Or Feld. Feld, actually.</p><p> IMUS: Gutfeld.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: And I said, I had a suspicion that he might be pretty good. My wife  says he is. And now here's how he came to my attention, because I was  watching the Fox New Year's Eve thing. I was out at the ranch.</p><p> MCCORD: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: And I was watching Megyn Kelly, who I like, and Bill Hemmer, who I  like him, too. And they were just way too happy. I mean that girl was so  happy, she was beside herself. And she's about 29 months pregnant. So she's  got the baby coming up here. </p><p> MCCORD: Sure. </p><p> IMUS: And they were just hysterical. Now, I didn't stay with them to see  the ball come down, because I don't do that. If you -- if you watch the  ball come down -- </p><p> MCCORD: Oh, man. </p><p> IMUS: You can't be a bigger loser in life. You can't do it. And if you're  there, most of the people in Times Square itself are from somewhere else.  They're tourists. They're not -- there's no New Yorkers who I know, and  I've been here for a long time, 30 years, who go there and stand there and,  you know, let people pee on you while they -- while you're waiting for the  ball to come down. I just don't think that happens, do you, Connell? </p><p> MCSHANE: No. </p><p> IMUS: OK.</p><p> MCSHANE: That's not going to happen.</p><p> IMUS: All right. So, I was asking about -- so, anyway, he was on, the \"Red  Eye\" guy, not the radio red eye guy, the other one, the TV \"Red Eye\" guy.  And so we -- I thought, well, let's have him on. Let's have him as a guest.  But first we have to find -- I mean I'm not interested in -- we didn't get  to be a successful as we are by experimenting, although we did used to do  that. But we don't do that anymore. We don't experiment with talent. So, I  guess, what's the matter, Connell?</p><p> MCSHANE: There's something on your shoulder, I-man. </p><p> IMUS: There is? </p><p> MCCORD: Yes, on your --</p><p> MCSHANE: Your coming apart.</p><p> IMUS: Oh, you know, hey, Connell --</p><p> MCCORD: Uh-oh.</p><p> IMUS: I mean, Trevor. You know what happened?</p><p> MCGUIRK: (INAUDIBLE). Damn it, someone! </p><p> ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Easy mistake.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Can you hear us now, chief? He can't hear us. </p><p> IMUS: No, I can't hear you, you little bastard. </p><p> MCGUIRK: Well, thanks for telling us. </p><p> IMUS: Hey, Connell, this thing -- I mean, Trevor, this thing came loose  again. </p><p> MCSHANE: I'll fix it for you. </p><p> IMUS: Well, actually, he can fix it.</p><p> All right, time for a little news and here with that -- </p><p> MCSHANE: Is Trevor.</p><p> IMUS: What's the matter? </p><p> MCCORD: Just the ongoing saga of the ear monitors. </p><p> IMUS: These are my $1,500 ear monitors. </p><p> MCCORD: There's something every freakin' 15 minutes. </p><p> IMUS: That won't stay together. </p><p> MCGUIRK: But what about Greg Gutfeld? </p><p> IMUS: Well, we're going to watch him -- I'm going to watch his show tonight  --</p><p> MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p> IMUS: And if he's any good, we'll have him on. I bet he must be, wouldn't  you think? Have you ever seen it, Bernie? </p><p> MCGUIRK: Yes. I have not really seen the show. It's on, as you said, 3:00  in the morning, no.</p><p> IMUS: My wife says he's good. </p><p> MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: And Opie, Anthony -- Anthony's on a lot, right? </p><p> BARTLETT: Supposedly. </p><p> IMUS: Well, we know Anthony's funny. I'll listen (ph).</p><p> Here's Chuck with the news. </p><p> MCCORD: The president says he is honored to have signed the bill to provide  the aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks and first responders who became  ill working at Ground Zero. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation  Act, named after a police officer who died of a respiratory disease that he  contracted during the 9/11 operations, his father now says he is happy  others will finally be getting the help they need. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an important not only because my son was sick  for four years, you know, and we watched him die and we couldn't get no  help for him. Now -- there was -- no one would recognize that he was sick  from the World Trade Center. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCCORD: The bill provides $4.2 billion in help to sick workers and several  hundred people who live near the burning pile, the toxicity at the World  Trade Center ruins. The president signing the measure in private as his  Hawaiian vacation neared its end. </p><p> IMUS: Bill Carter, a journalist from \"The New York Times,\" who's a nice  guy, by the way. Writes all these books about the late night talk show wars  that nobody cares about and no one reads. And -- but they're good. I guess  I read them. (INAUDIBLE). He and some other clown wrote an article over the  past couple of weeks about Jon Stewart being perhaps the new Edward R.  Murrow --</p><p> MCCORD: Crusader. </p><p> IMUS: Which I suspect even Mr. Stewart, who I am a fan of --</p><p> MCCORD: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: Found amusing. If not ironic, except every time I use the word  ironic, with apologies to Nora Ephron, I always wonder if I'm using it  correctly.</p><p> MCCORD: Correct.</p><p> IMUS: And I suspect I'm not. But at any rate, because Stewart was railing  about the Republicans who had embraced tragedy of 9/11 as almost their  campaign mantra slogan deal, and that they were not entitled to do that  anymore because essentially they had refused, which I thought was a  disgrace and so did Mr. Stewart. So he talked about it. Then he had some of  the responders on. So they were, Mr. Carter and some other dope from \"The  Times,\" were crediting Mr. Stewart with providing the impetus for this to  be passed, which I thought, well, it might have brought some attention to  it, but it certainly didn't spur any Republicans to change their minds  about it or to feel some sort of necessity to take action on this and to  realize how absolutely disgraceful they were behaving. </p><p> But I saw Shep Smith -- I played this last hour and it's worth playing  again. I'll tell you why. Because he does the news on -- he does the news  two hours on it on the Fox News Channel. And some of my friends, like  Esther Newberg, I love her to death, but is one of these elitist, liberal  snobs who, you know, they all think they have all the answers and she's one  of these people who refuses to watch Fox News because she thinks they have  some sort of agenda and yet, like a moron, she'll watch MSNBC or CNN, who  are both dreadful and disgraceful and clearly do have an agenda or, say,  CBS or ABC or, for God's sake, NBC. </p><p> So I would call her attention, and I would call to Mr. Carter's attention  as well, what Shep Smith had to say about it. And Shep Smith -- I'm going  to play it in a second -- referenced Jon Stewart. What I think is  significant about it is, is that if you're a Republican like John Thune, I  had that dope on, and some of these other people who were dragging their  feet and just refusing to vote on this, and Senator Thune had these lame  excuses that he gave me. And much to my discredit, I didn't press him on it  and should have, but I thought, well, he didn't want to rush into anything  and it was too much other money was -- it was a bunch of pork and stuff in  it and even that was kind of Bernie's rap on this. And people like Hannity  and some of these other dopes.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: Those are the facts. </p><p> IMUS: The facts are nothing. The point is -- the facts are stupid. The  point is, it should have been passed and, of course, now it was passed and  they did take out about $3 billion of pork.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: My point, God, if I could make the point, is that when Shep Smith  talked about it, that got the attention of all of the Republicans and  everyone else, because they're thinking, if Shep Smith, with that enormous  audience that he has and that Fox News has, if he's against this, then as  Walter Cronkite famously said or Lyndon Johnson said about Walter Cronkite  during the Vietnam War, if we've lost him, we've lost the country. Here's  Shep Smith.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS: Last night on Jon Stewart, it was Jon Stewart's last  (INAUDIBLE) of the week and, OK, we watch it. Whatever. And he's just flat  on, absolutely right. And it's worth saying, who's going to hold these  people's feet to the fire when we -- you know, we're able to put a 52 story  building down there so far at Ground Zero. We're able to pay for tax cuts  for billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the  economy, but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who  ran right into the fire, went down there to save people. The people knew  what this city was like that day. People were walking over bridges. They  were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying.  Their family members were dead. And these people ran to Ground Zero to  stave people's lives. And we're not going to even give them medicine for  the illnesses that they got down there. It's disgusting. It's a national  disgrace. It's a shame. And everybody who voted against it should have to  stand up and account for himself or herself. Is anybody going to hold them  accountable? </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you just did. </p><p> SMITH: Well, I'm not really in a position to do that. I mean I think I just  kind of went out there and said what the truth is and I feel like -- I feel  like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people.  There was no warning label on Ground Zero on 9/11 \"these substances will  kill you.\" And even if there had been, they'd have gone anyway. They just  need a little bit of help. It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of  things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax  refunds than we do doing anything for those people, don't we? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IMUS: So that's Shep Smith, Fox News. So the next time one of you want to  tell me about Fox News, I'm going to tell you about Shep Smith. That's what  I'm talking about. </p><p> Now, I didn't see Diane Sawyer and I didn't see that coward Brian Williams  or that little rodent over there. Well, we don't need to get into name  calling, Don. </p><p> MCCORD: Well, why are we? </p><p> IMUS: Or the very lovely Katie Couric --</p><p> MCCORD: Better.</p><p> IMUS: Or the -- well, not so courageous, that's a better way to put it,  Brian Williams. Did you ever -- did -- what -- did they say anything about  it? </p><p> MCGUIRK: No.</p><p> MCCORD: No.</p><p> IMUS: Well, no, of course not. Were they railing about it at MSNBC? Well,  of course not. So that's what I'm talking about. So if you're the John  Thunes of the world and you turn that on -- it's on all the time here -- if  you see Shep Smith calling you out -- </p><p> MCCORD: Then, wait a minute. </p><p> IMUS: By the way, Chris Wallace in there sucking his thumb, thinking, oh, I  hope I don't get in trouble. </p><p> MCGUIRK: No, he brought it up on the Sunday show. </p><p> IMUS: Anyway, quarter after the hour. Time for a little sports now. </p><p> MCGUIRK: And the (INAUDIBLE) Democrats controlled Congress for two years,  with the Democratic president, and they waited till the lame duck session  to try to pass this (INAUDIBLE). </p><p> IMUS: Save all that for next time you're on Hannity. </p><p> It's 16 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I'll get an  e-mail from Hannity. </p><p> Did we do your business report yet, Connell? </p><p> MCSHANE: Not yet, I don't think. </p><p> IMUS: No, OK, we can do it in a minute. Don't worry about it. </p><p> MCSHANE: OK, I'm not. </p><p> IMUS: Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf. </p><p> Good morning, Warner. </p><p> WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Good morning, I-man. </p><p> Well, they completed the playoff picture last night. The lonely Seattle  Seahawks finishing 7-9, beat the Rams 16-6. They win the NFC West. Change  the rule, man. Forget winning the division, you can't have a losing record.  You're out. Replaced by the non-playoff team with the best record. The  Giants, by the way, will bring back Tom Coughlin. </p><p> Packers win their final wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3.. That  eliminated the Giants. The Colts win the AFC South, beat the Titans 23-20.  Adam Vinatieri's 43 yard field goal, last play of the game. Although the  Colts didn't know it, because they didn't show the score on the scoreboard.  They had actually won it minutes earlier when the Jags lost. The Steelers  win the AFC North. The Falcons win the NFC South.</p><p> And the NBA last night, in Los Angeles, before a rare booing crowd, they  booed the Lakers at the Staples Center. The Lakers lost to the Grizzlies by  19 points, 104-85. And after the game, Phil Jackson blamed it on Kobe  Bryant. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, early in the  third quarter on some stupid plays, and, you know, Kobe has to screw up  the, you know, game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one. That  takes the rest of the guys out. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WOLF: Wow, Kobe screwing up the game. </p><p> IMUS: So Kobe was going one-on-one with some other member of the other  team, obviously, duh, right? </p><p> MCGUIRK: No, one of the members of -- one of the audience members. </p><p> IMUS: Well, speaking of the audience, here's what's wrong with the Lakers. </p><p> WOLF: What is it? </p><p> IMUS: It's one thing if Jack Nicholson wants to have floor seats -- I mean,  I think he deserves those. He's earned them, don't you think? </p><p> WOLF: Yes. </p><p> IMUS: But not Larry David. Not some sit -- not some sitcom dope. </p><p> MCCORD: What's he done? </p><p> IMUS: Well, should be sitting there -- I mean you just can't. </p><p> WOLF: Yes, work it --</p><p> IMUS: And yet I watched the game on Christmas Day, the brain did -- of  course I'm furiously e-mailing Breen my comments as he's trying to do the  game, which I'm sure -- and he sometimes answers them, by the way.</p><p> WOLF: Oh.</p><p> IMUS: But Larry David? How possibly could Larry David -- who gave Larry  David a floor seat? That's a disgrace. </p><p> MCGUIRK: He only created \"Seinfeld.\" Come on. </p><p> IMUS: What does \"Seinfeld\" have do with it. Seinfeld must have something to  do with it. </p><p> MCGUIRK: Yes, a little bit. Larry David's a genius? </p><p> IMUS: Still shouldn't be sitting on -- he's a sitcom dope. He shouldn't be  sitting on the floor. </p><p> MCGUIRK: Get him out.</p><p> IMUS: He just don't. He may be a genius, but he shouldn't be sitting on the  floor. This is the guy you were screaming about he peed on Jesus.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Yes, we all stray.</p><p> IMUS: He's -- he is a genius or you -- or he peed on Jesus. You can't pee  on Jesus, can you? </p><p> MCCORD: And be a genius.</p><p> MCGUIRK: No. </p><p> LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: And be a genius.</p><p> IMUS: Huh? </p><p> MCCORD: And be a genius, no.</p><p> MCGUIRK: The two are not mutually exclusive.</p><p> IMUS: It doesn't take a genius to pee on Jesus. It takes 12 -- well, it  takes probably a drunk or, you know --</p><p> MCGUIRK: The fact that he got away with it, that was so offensive. </p><p> IMUS: Yes. </p><p> Anyway, 19 after the hour. </p><p> So, were you finished with sports, Warner? </p><p> WOLF: His third sack of the game. </p><p> IMUS: OK. Time for a little business news and here with that is Connell  McShane.</p><p> Good morning, Connell. </p><p> MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man.</p><p> Just a few quick headlines for you this morning. The market is up again  after an 11 percent gain for the Dow in 2010. And the 17 percent rise for  the Nasdaq in 2010. The futures are way up this morning. Maybe some  optimism about economic data. We had plenty of it this week. Construction  spending and manufacturing today. The big retail reports out for the month  of December on Thursday and the jobs report for the month of December on  Friday. </p><p> So that is there, plus the report, I-man, in \"The New York Times\" that we  talked about earlier that Facebook has received an investment of $500  million from Goldman Sachs, according to \"The Times,\" which values Facebook  at $50 billion. </p><p> IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning here on the  IMUS IN THE MORNING program. And then Dagen McDowell, who will be coming up  in a few minutes. She and Connell do their very own show at 11:00 a.m. on  the Fox Business Network. </p><p> It's 20 minutes after the hour. Here's one of Mary Matalin's five favorite  songs.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS: Well, let me tell you about Lindamood-Bell. You know what, the lady  who runs Lindamood-Bell grew up on a cattle ranch. Old Nancy. Did you know  that? I want to share with you the success story from the Lindamood-Bell  learning processes. This is from a parent with an eight-year-old son  diagnosed with autism. Here's the letter. </p><p> \"David was diagnosed with autism and struggled with socializing, expressive  language, critical thinking, comprehension. David started with an  assessment at Lindamood-Bell and did an eight week intensive program. The  staff at Lindamood-Bell was sensitive to our concerns and needs and gave us  constant feedback. David has improved tremendously. Before Lindamood-Bell,  his overall comprehension was at the ninth percentile. After his retest at  Lindamood-Bell, he was at the 70 percentile.\" That's unbelievable, isn't  it? Call them at 800-300-1818 or go online at lindamoodbell.com. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCSHANE: All right, Johnson &amp; Johnson, today, is going to announce a  powerful new cancer test that it wants to put on the market. It's a blood  test. It is billed as being able to spot a single cancer cell out of a  billion healthy cells. J&amp;J teaming up with scientists who invented the test  to make it cheaper and better. And their hope is that the blood test can  take the place of more invasive cancer tests. </p><p> Stocks starting off the new year with gains. The data out of China is being  seen as a positive for the market. It showed manufacturing slip for the  first time in five months, but what's that doing is it's easing some  inflation concerns. And Europe has been up all morning long. London closed  today because of the New Year's holiday. But Paris up 2 percent. Germany up  1.25 percent.</p><p> Here in the U.S., stock index futures indicating a higher open a little  over an hour from now on Wall Street with the Dow futures up by 90 points.  And a quick look at commodities as well. The oil price is around $92 a  barrel all morning. And gold, after being lower, is now up over $1 at  $1,422 per ounce.</p><p> All right. The IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right now here at the  Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper. </p><p> IMUS: All right. Twenty-six after the hour as we continue to get behind  here. But it's -- we're getting everything in, so that's more important  than anything else, I guess. So, it's time for a little business news  again. Here with that, Dagen McDowell.</p><p> Good morning, Dagen. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p> From getting behind to going up, gas prices. The national average for  regular unleaded is already $3.07 a gallon. It's going to head back to near  $4 a gallon by the spring according to many experts. It should be the  second highest year on record in terms of prices. Let's hope it doesn't get  back to $4.11 a gallon. That was a record hit in the summer of '08.</p><p> And, by the way, if you're interested in how Shania Twain's life develops  with this new husband, who's the ex-husband of the woman who broke up  Shania's marriage, she's going to have her own show on the new Oprah  Winfrey Network later this year, I believe, called \"Why Not?\" with Shania  Twain. </p><p> MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Yes. So you can keep --</p><p> IMUS: Do you have a picture of the husband? Because she's cute. </p><p> MCDOWELL: He's cute. Do we have a picture of their wedding? </p><p> IMUS: No, of him?</p><p> MCDOWELL: Oh, well, of him.</p><p> IMUS: You were telling me how hot he was.</p><p> MCDOWELL: He's got -- well, he's got curly -- he's got curly hair and it  kind of has a little bit of a mullet if memory serves. He's pretty cute.  He's better looking than Mutt Lange, I'll put it that way. </p><p> IMUS: That's a white trash deal on that, isn't it? </p><p> MCCORD: Oh, brother.</p><p> IMUS: That's a white trash trailer park situation. </p><p> MCDOWELL: Yes, but you get to watch it for free, though, when you watch it  on the TV. That's -- or you can come over to my house, which I don't think  you want to do. </p><p> IMUS: Yes. How did that go, by the way, over the holidays at your house? </p><p> MCDOWELL: It was all right. I got trapped in the house with six adults,  three kids and three dogs. And one of the dogs, being a four month old  border collie puppy. So that was a good time. </p><p> IMUS: Who were the adults? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Mama, daddy, brother, his wife, Jonas and me. If you could call  us all adults. </p><p> IMUS: How is your brother's wife? How do you get along with her? </p><p> MCDOWELL: I adore her. </p><p> IMUS: Oh, you do? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Yes. We get along good. </p><p> IMUS: Oh, that's too bad. </p><p> MCDOWELL: Why? </p><p> IMUS: Well, we'd just like a little friction and stuff going on. So there  wasn't any animosity that bubbled to the surface there or any long held  resentments or anything?</p><p> MCDOWELL: No, I wasn't happy with -- no, I wasn't happy with my Christmas  gifts from Jonas. But other than that. </p><p> IMUS: What did he get you?</p><p> MCDOWELL: Underwear that he bought -- I know he bought on sale because I  saw it on sale on the Internet. And a computer, a laptop, which is just  business. I didn't want something business related. And I wanted underwear  that fit that was nicer than what he gave me. So, I was mad. At least I  didn't get those pajama jeans. I mean I can look on the bright side. </p><p> IMUS: Oh, he didn't get you like them big ole granny drawers, did he?</p><p> MCDOWELL: Some were, yes, large in size. Some, too small. There was no  happy medium.</p><p> IMUS: He didn't' get --</p><p> MCDOWELL: There was no happy medium. They were either to small and  uncomfortable or they were too big and loose. </p><p> IMUS: So he didn't go the Victoria's Secret thong deal? </p><p> MCDOWELL: No, he went on the Internet to one of these private sales sites  and bought drawers on sale. </p><p> IMUS: Oh, he got you some -- he got you some of those Hanes -- big old --  them Hanes big beefy drawers. </p><p> MCCORD: Off of eBay. </p><p> IMUS: All right, time for a Bernard McGuirk briefing, a \"Bernie Briefing,\"  sponsored by -- these big old beefy drawers. </p><p> MCCORD: That ain't right. </p><p> IMUS: Sponsored by P.C. Richard &amp; Son. A hundred and one years they've got  it going on. Still going on. </p><p> What's up, B?</p><p> MCGUIRK: Well, chief, on the \"New Year's Rocking Eve\" fright night, the TV  shows, I confess I was one of the losers who was up at midnight watching.  And I was watching Dick Clark --</p><p> IMUS: No, don't do this.</p><p> MCGUIRK: And -- well, no, no, this is -- this is a big story. There are  competing, differing opinions as to whether or not Dick Clark should still  be out there.  Some people say it's an inspiration, but --   </p><p> IMUS:  No, no.  It's too humiliating for him.  Whoever is around him  shouldn't let him do this.  It's terrible.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DICK CLARK, BROADCASTER:  But don't you go anywhere. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Where did that come from?  </p><p> IMUS:  I didn't hear the sound.  There's no point in playing it.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  We have audio here.  Lou will play it.</p><p> Here, Lou.  Go ahead.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CLARK:  Thank you, Ryan, very much.  Now, take a look at all the people up  on Broadway.  I don't know how people pull off this party year after year,  but they do a whale of a job.  And tonight it will be bigger and better  than ever.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Again, some people say that's inspiring, and some people say it's  out of place.  But in any case, he won the night far and away.  He was the  most watched show that night of all the broadcast and cable New Year's Eve  shows.  And God bless poor old Dick Clark.  </p><p> IMUS:  You bastard.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  What?  </p><p> IMUS:  You evil bastard.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Why?  </p><p> IMUS:  You just can't -- </p><p> MCCORD:  Well, he shouldn't be going on.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  I didn't put him on ABC.  </p><p> IMUS:  No, no.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  I think he should be on.  I think he is an inspiration.</p><p> IMUS:  Put him on Fox.  No.  No.  </p><p> MCCORD:  He was just presenting the controversy. </p><p> IMUS:  You put him on ABC.  You can't be.  You can't do that.  It's  horrible.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Well, I happen to disagree.  I think it's a good thing.  I think  it's a nice thing.  And again, it inspires people who have been ill.  </p><p> My dad had a stroke, he came back from it.  It makes people say, yes, I can  do it.  </p><p> IMUS:  I don't know.  Here he is on -- who is that Ryan Seacrest?  Do you  have any sound on that, Big Foot.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  We have a little -- we have sound.  Lou and I have some sound  from Ryan Seacrest just before --   </p><p> IMUS:  Well, there's Dick and -- Big Foot, we can't hear any sound on this.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Maybe he doesn't want to.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RYAN SEACREST:  Sorry.  Sorry, not my fault.  </p><p> CLARK:  Happy New Year.</p><p> SEACREST:  Happy New Year.  Great job.  </p><p> CLARK:  Thank you, Ryan.  Thank you.</p><p> SEACREST:  Thank you so much.  </p><p> Dick Clark, ladies and gentlemen.  </p><p> Well, we are inside, and it's even warmer in here.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCGUIRK:  That's a nice thing.  The man's been through hell and back.  Way  to kick off the new year.  </p><p> Charles, push him.  Is he all right?  </p><p> MCCORD:  He's all right, but he's --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Looking to the future.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)   </p><p> IMUS:  You son of a bitch! </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Tom goes for the easy joke.  </p><p> IMUS:  Call that funny, Charles?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good.  Now everybody is -- </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Everybody is waiting to see who is going to say it.  </p><p> IMUS:  Tom.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, Tom, have you got that clip?  Lou?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'll he come up here and I'll find you.  Are you coming  down here?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I just got to e-mail from Neil Cavuto.  </p><p> IMUS:  That's not funny.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was down at the ranch last we week.  </p><p> MCCORD:  This is not -- stop.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's not funny.  It's not funny, no.  </p><p> MCCORD:  This is not good.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's not funny, Bernard.  It's not.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Look, God bless Dick Clark, is all I'm saying.  </p><p> MCCORD:  There is an is inspirational story.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes.  That Ryan Seacrest, too.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.  </p><p> IMUS:  No.</p><p> MCCORD:  You've got to stop.  </p><p> IMUS:  Oh, God.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  \"Blonde on Blonde\" is coming up tomorrow.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> IMUS:  That's just horrible.  God.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Imus at night -- be there.  </p><p> IMUS:  Why do they do that?  That's horrible.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why are they wheeling him out there?  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  No, it's his show.  He's as lucid as they come.  He just can't  speak properly.  So why not?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's the way he's going to go out though.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  So what?  That's his choice.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, it's not.  </p><p> IMUS:  That's not right.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  It was a ratings winner for the night.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, I don't think it had much to do -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let's go see how he is?</p><p> IMUS:  Do you?</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Ryan Seacrest.  You had a bunch of great performers.  Kesha was  there.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, Ryan Seacrest, if you get down and you -- I mean, I like him,  but if you get down and you scrape the bottom of the show biz barrel,  that's where you find Ryan Seacrest.  I mean, he's on the E! Channel, for  God's sake.  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  He's \"American Idol.\"  He's at the top of his game, that guys.  </p><p> IMUS:  Oh, whatever.  He's at the bottom of the barrel.   He may be at the  top of the game, but -- </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a business  update from the Fox Business Network.  Here's Connell McShane.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  And when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California  Congressman Darrell Issa getting a big promotion.  He'll become the  chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which basically means he'll be  the one or heading up the committee that oversees the government.</p><p> And appearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Issa telling Chris Wallace he's going  to target government spending.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  We have about $1.7 trillion worth of  regulatory costs already in the government.  If the president wants to  throw another $300 or $400 billion, what he's doing is taking it right out  of businesses, right out of employment, right out of competitiveness.  We  need to make sure we can compete. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings as  committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also  Medicare.  </p><p> Checking in on the markets here this morning for you, up all morning long.   And we are indicated higher on the futures by 85 points now on Dow futures.   It looks like a strong start to the new year coming on Wall Street in just  a little while.</p><p> It's the IMUS IN THE MORNING program that continues right now with a check  of the forecast.    </p><p> (WEATHER REPORT)</p><p> IMUS:  Twenty minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program, on the radio all over the country, and on the Fox Business Network  all over the world.  Three new radio affiliates today --  WAUB, 1590, way  up there on the right-hand side of the dial where the dogs can listen, and  at 94.1 FM here in Auburn, New York.  </p><p> MCCORD:  But you can't.  </p><p> IMUS:  On WGBA, 1240 on the dial there in Geneva, New York, Finger Lakes  News Radio.  And KWKC, 1340 AM, in Abilene, Texas, Talk Radio 1340.  </p><p> Tomorrow, on this program, Tom Friedman.  Wednesday, \"Blonde on Blonde.\"  </p><p> Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, our old friend,  former assistant to the president, vice president, a bunch of other stuff,  Mary Matlin.  </p><p> Good morning, Ms. Matalin.  </p><p> MARY MATALIN, FMR. ASSISTANT TO VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY:  Here, kitty kitty.   Hey.  Good morning.  Happy New Year.  </p><p> IMUS:  Are you calling the cat?  </p><p> MATALIN:  Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty.  Here, kitty kitty.  She was trapped  outside and was about to unleash the dogs of my hell, my mini dachshund.  I  said, \"Kitty.\"  </p><p> It irritates I-Man.  He doesn't want to hear you.</p><p> IMUS:  I like cats and dogs.  What's your cat's name?  </p><p> MATALIN:  Witchy.  She has one green eye and one blue eye.  </p><p> IMUS:  Why are you out of breath?  </p><p> MATALIN:  Because I had to move the chair, open the shades, and open the  window from the bottom up, while I was holding the phone in my ear.  And  I'm old now.  </p><p> IMUS:  Did you -- what did you do New Year's Eve?  </p><p> MATALIN:  Made black eyed peas and cabbage and listened to WWOZ and had a  glass of wine by myself.  </p><p> IMUS:  Where was James?  </p><p> MATALIN:  Was it after 9:00?  If it's after 9:00, he's in bed.  </p><p> IMUS:  So did you stay up and watch the ball come down?  </p><p> MATALIN:  I listened to WWOZ, which is the best jazz in the world -- Irvin  Mayfield, jazz play club on Bourbon Street live.  </p><p> IMUS:  Radio?  </p><p> MATALIN:  Yes.  </p><p> IMUS:  Oh, you didn't make that clear.  </p><p> MATALIN:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I should know everybody doesn't  know WWOZ.  But if you don't, you can get it live streaming.  It's the best  jazz.  </p><p> IMUS:  Because Bernie just played a cut of Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking  Eve in which Mr. Clark was on.  And, of course, he's had a stroke some  years ago.  </p><p> MATALIN:  Yes, I saw it on, and I have to take Bernie's side as I do on  most things on this.  I thought it was an inspiration.  </p><p> IMUS:  You thought it was an inspiration?  </p><p> MATALIN:  I guess you don't.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, an inspiration to who?  </p><p> MATALIN:  Just what Bernie said.  If you've been -- if you've come back  from something that -- a disease that people -- or suffered from something  that would normally render you hidden away for whatever reason, and you can  come back, that's an inspiration to others who are similarly afflicted.   Heart disease or cancer or anything, you can talk about it and show people  that everything is workable, and life is worth living.  </p><p> IMUS:  Does she have a point, Charles?  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes, and a point that it need not be in all cases the end and -- </p><p> MATALIN:  Or it can be a different reality.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Exactly.  And Mr. Clark is a textbook example of that.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, but my problem with it is --   </p><p> MCCORD:  What?  </p><p> IMUS:  -- is that whenever it gets played on this program, and the reason  that it's intended to be a source of amusement, that's the problem.  </p><p> MATALIN:  So it's not -- so, as always, it's always about you.  This is  about what, is that you're saying?  You didn't like it?  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, guess what?  It's 2011.  Suddenly, it's not going to be about  me this year.  Well, of course.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MATALIN:  This is your new New Year's resolution?  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, no, but I don't know -- </p><p> MCCORD:  It could be about him a few years down the road.  </p><p> IMUS:  I just don't -- I don't know.  I feel bad for the guy and I don't  think it's funny.  I mean, you can make it funny.  They did make it funny,  Bernie and Lou, of course, and Charles.  </p><p> MCCORD:  You made it funny.  </p><p> IMUS:  Huh?  </p><p> MATALIN:  You made it funny.  Bernie made it about -- </p><p> IMUS:  Then they made it about me, a window to the future.  </p><p> MATALIN:  You invited it.  You invited it by being so -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  I don't invite the ridicule that I constantly get on this program.  </p><p> MATALIN:  Oh.  </p><p> IMUS:  Anyway.  </p><p> MATALIN:  OK.  </p><p> IMUS:  So the Bush tax cuts, I guess, have been extended.  What does that  mean?  </p><p> MATALIN:  That means these rich bastards who don't need them, you know, are  now going to get them.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, why do you think the president did it?  </p><p> MATALIN: Because he's -- he just wanted to screw his own guys.  </p><p> IMUS:  Really?  </p><p> MATALIN:  No.  None of the above.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well what then?  </p><p> MATALIN:  It's -- I think we -- he did it because he didn't want to be  blamed for not doing it.  And Larry Summers and everybody else came out and  said that reality, which will give us a double-dip recession if taxes are  affected in a recession.  </p><p> IMUS:  So you think it's going to have an impact on the economy?  </p><p> MATALIN:  I think the opposite would have had a severe impact, a better  impact -- </p><p> IMUS:  That's not what I asked you. </p><p> MATALIN:  Well, these aren't yes or no questions.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, answer it as best as you can, as you're capable of.</p><p> MATALIN:  I'm answering it.</p><p> IMUS:  By opening the window and choking your cat.  </p><p> MATALIN:  One of the cats, the one that still has a tail.  </p><p> A better package would have been to have no spending increases and leave  the tax structure as it was, and leave the estate tax where it was so  people don't make decisions upon -- about their final days based on their  tax situation, which I think is immoral.  That would have been the better  package, but that's not what happened because politics -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> IMUS:  Well, the rap we were hearing, Mary Matalin, is that if we gave the  tax cuts to all these rich bastards and these other folks, that that would  all -- that they would then invest in the economy and hire more people and  all that sort of thing.  </p><p> So, my question is, do you think that's going to happen?  </p><p> MATALIN:  No, that's the rap that -- that's -- the case for tax cuts as a  stimulative economic policy do not -- </p><p> IMUS:  I like that phrase.</p><p> MATALIN:  -- go to those tax cuts.  That was maintaining a tax rate, the  changing of which would have exacerbated recessionary problems.</p><p> Stimulative taxes -- not all tax cuts are created equal -- would have been  further reductions of the top rates, a reduction in the corporate tax rate,  eradication of corporate taxes loopholes and such, and tax reform, which  the president's talking about.  That's stimulative tax policy, not just  keeping the same rates.  So that's one of their canards.</p><p> And what would be most stimulative now is to continue to reduce or make  some effort to stop spending and roll back the debt, starting with health  care.  So that will be the plan, and I hope they get some of it done.  </p><p> IMUS:  And your scummy Republican friends were shamed into caving in on the  9/11 Responders Bill. </p><p> MATALIN:  In response to scummy liberals, who -- </p><p> IMUS:  And inspired quite a bit by Shep Smith (ph).</p><p> MATALIN:  -- let it sit there for years and did nothing about it, and wait  until it's Christmas Eve and lard it up.  Yes, it should have been passed.    It should have been passed two years earlier.  There shouldn't have been  anybody who had any problem getting any health care at any time from 9/11  on.  </p><p> IMUS:  By the way, that's a very good point.  </p><p> Hey, how are things in New Orleans?  You live there now, right?  </p><p> MATALIN:  We're going on year three.  </p><p> IMUS:  Huh?  </p><p> MATALIN:  This is our third year here.  It's wonderful.  </p><p> IMUS:  Who is the new mayor there?  </p><p> MATALIN:  He's spectacular.  </p><p> IMUS:  Who is it -- huh?  </p><p> MATALIN:  He's going to be up in New York.  He comes a lot.  He's got a new  police chief.  </p><p> IMUS:  What is his name?  </p><p> Oh, I'm sorry.  Mitch Landrieu, Mayor Mitch.  </p><p> IMUS:  Has he been indicted yet?  </p><p> MATALIN:  We used to -- half the state was under water and other half was  under indictment.  But we're not like that now.  We're all cleaned up now.  </p><p> IMUS:  Happy New Year to you, the kids, him.</p><p> MATALIN:  And Happy New Year.  You'll never be  -- you'll always be you,  Imus.  You'll just always be you.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, let's hope so.  Thank you.  </p><p> MATALIN:  Happy New Year.  </p><p> IMUS:  Mary Matalin.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right.  Here is the \"Fox Business Minute.\"  </p><p> Many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day.   There was a glitch in the phone's alarm clock feature.  Users who set their  alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't go off when 2011 arrived.  </p><p> An Apple spokesperson says the fix is in the works and all alarms will work  properly starting today.  But users in Europe and Asia saying the problem  has not yet been fixed.  </p><p>Vizio, maker of inexpensive flat-TV screens, is looking to expand.  \"The  Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell  phones and tablet computers, and those two products, the Via Phone and the  Via Tablet, will be introduced this summer.  The announcement comes just  days ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show taking place this week in Las  Vegas.  </p><p> And \"Little Fockers\" holding on to the top spot at the weekend box office.   That movie bringing in just over $26 million this past weekend, so it's  total now $103 million.</p><p> With no other movies -- no new movies being released over the New Year's  weekend, the rest of the lineup looks similar to last week.  The number two  and three movies are still \"True Grit\" and \"TRON Legacy.\"</p><p> As for the futures this morning, they have been higher all morning long,  indicating the Wall Street open will be to the upside, as Dow futures are  up by 83 points.</p><p> And IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, \"The Power to  Prosper.\"  </p><p> IMUS:  Coming up on five minutes to the hour.  This portion of the IMUS IN  THE MORNING program sponsored by State Bank.  Put your business in a better  state.  Visit statebankofli.com.</p><p> Well, coming up next hour, Jeff Greenfield.  We'll talk to him, CBS News.   And then Stuart Varney.</p><p> Is Stuart here today, Connell?  Do you know?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I think he would be, yes.  Back to full strength.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, he is.  He's here.  </p><p> IMUS:  Oh, he is?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, that's unusual, because ordinarily he would stretch one of  these New Year's deals into an extra week's vacation, but apparently he's  not done that.</p><p> Gangsta Mickey is here, and so is Charles Rangel, neither of whom have been  on this morning, but they will get on coming up.  </p><p> It's five minutes now until the hour.     </p><p> IMUS:  Why are you looking at me -- with your mouth hanging open like a $2  suitcase?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Huh?</p><p> IMUS:  Made you look -- huh?  What's the matter?  </p><p> POWELL:  No, it's just another day at the home.  That's what it is.  Just  dropping my fork.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes, that's not good.  </p><p> Hi, dude.</p><p> IMUS:  What?  </p><p> MCCORD:  When you start dropping your utensils.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, no.  I wasn't eating, you idiot.  </p><p> POWELL:  Well, you freaked out about it though.  It's like, \"Oh, my fork.\"  </p><p> IMUS:  I dropped it because I have this tea, and they have hunks of lemon  in it.  And I eat the lemon.  </p><p> POWELL:  Sucking on a lemon.</p><p> MCCORD:  Eat the lemon, baby.</p><p> IMUS:  That's what I had for breakfast.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Eat the worm.  </p><p> POWELL:  So that's what's putting on all those pounds, those lemons and the  condiment sandwiches?  </p><p> IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p> MCCORD:  You're going to have to cut out those lemon wedges.  Those lemon  wedges are killing you, I-Dude.</p><p> IMUS:  Ballooned up to 153 pounds.  </p><p> POWELL:  Yes, less tomato in your sandwich.  Maybe just one slice of onion.  </p><p> IMUS:  I'm not happy with either one of you bastards.  Got to get some new  blood in here.  </p><p> BARTLETT:  Why don't you do that?</p><p> IMUS:  Huh?</p><p> BARTLETT:  Why don't you do that?  And let me know how that works out for  you.  </p><p> IMUS:  Get old Cara (ph) to call, see what she is he' doing.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> BARTLETT:  Yes, she'll commute back and forth from L.A.  </p><p> IMUS:  Did you tell me her new boyfriend died?  </p><p> BARTLETT:  Yes.</p><p> POWELL:  This is a boyfriend or girlfriend?</p><p> BARTLETT:  Yes, it's -- I don't know if -- obviously not the one she's  dating now.  </p><p> (REPEAT PACKAGE)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC.

I went to the Jets game yesterday, they won, 38-7. But you know that already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS: Yes, I don't care about the Jets game because they were already in the playoffs. So I don't care about the Seattle Seahawks and the Rams people, but I'll find out apparently from Warner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCSHANE: So one of them with - record made the playoffs. I'm being told in my ear, you want to know who won now or no?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS: No, let me find out from Warner, because, Warner likes to tell me stuff like that.</p><p>MCSHANE: It is Warner's job.</p><p>IMUS: Santa brought us a goofy tie? Is that what happened?</p><p>MCSHANE: No, I had that one already, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: The funny tie, under the tree.</p><p>MCSHANE: So you got two weeks off and that is the best you could come up with.</p><p>IMUS: That's all I could come up with.</p><p>MCSHANE: You sound great, by the way. How this is voice, good?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't have throat cancer, they tell me, but I do have -- pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCSHANE: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Yes --and, like if you had a colonoscopy and they find this -- remove them, so, these are -- they have to take them off with a laser here in a couple of weeks, and this is way too much information.</p><p>MCSHANE: I actually care. I told you, I care.</p><p>IMUS: I'll be fine.</p><p>MCSHANE: You will be OK, that is the main point.</p><p>IMUS: Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, and Mary Matalin coming up this morning.

It's no joke right there.</p><p>IMUS: Please.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's what Goldman thinks it's worth anyway. I will get to that in a second, but thank you, I-man and good morning. First, let's bring up the markets and look up some numbers here because stocks are starting off the new week and the New Year with some gains here globally.</p><p>China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and if anything that's actually easing concerns about inflation and the Chinese market at the bottom screen is up 1-3/4 percent overnight.</p><p>Markets in Hong Kong and South Korea are also up, and Japan has not resumed trading yet in the New Year. Over in Europe, London is closed today for the New Year's holiday, but Paris and Frankfurt are both up significantly, Paris by more than 2 percent and our futures indicating a higher open on Wall Street as well up by 76 points on Dow futures, pretty good numbers.</p><p>Now as for the major indexes and how they fared in 2010, the Dow gained 11 percent, S&amp;P 13 percent, the Nasdaq the best performer of the bunch, 17 percent gain.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on more debt national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion ceiling and the White House Council of Economic Advisors, Chairman Austin Goolsbee on ABC's \"This Week\" saying it's crucial the ceiling is raised.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUSTIN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: This is not a game, you know, the debt ceiling is not something to toy with. That is the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that is the -- essentially defaulting on our obligations, which is unprecedented in American history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree it does need to be raised but, many of them are also saying they will not go along with it unless they get promises to change Washington's spending habits and argue there is no point in having a debt ceiling if they raise it every time the national debt gets close. Now here's the story that the I-man was referring to a moment ago.</p><p>Goldman Sachs investing $450 million in Facebook, according to the \"New York Times.\" A Russian company also buying $50 million worth of Facebook's stock. \"The Times\" says these deals value Facebook at $50 billion. Now, as we have reported the FCC now looking into secondary market trading at Facebook's privately held shares.</p><p>Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its web site, the latest development in the conflict between airlines and online travel agencies, since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says Expedia intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results. American is looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own web site and every effort to save money. Expedia says the move will only cost them ticket sales and believes Americans' efforts are bad for travellers.</p><p>All right, let's take a live look now at commodities this morning. The oil price is above $92 per barrel and gold is down by a dollar per ounce.</p><p>Coming up, a little bit later on in the hour, Bo Dietl will be the I-man's guest as IMUS IN THE MORNING does get started, right now, Fox Business, power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: Warner, who won the football game last night?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Seahawks, man, they finished 7-9. Win the division and are in the playoffs.</p><p>IMUS: So the giants, who are 10-6, they are not in the playoffs.</p><p>WOLF: You got it. No, you have to change the rule.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN: That is crazy.</p><p>WOLF: Absurd, yes.</p><p>IMUS: I will whip somebody's butt over there -- Charles and I.</p><p>WOLF: Now you're talking.</p><p>IMUS: Charles and me, yes. And, I get my grammar screwed up. Happy New Year, everybody.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Shucks.</p><p>IMUS: Bring you up on my medical, last time --</p><p>MCCORD: Let's have the latest.</p><p>IMUS: I'm had a biopsy -- let me say this about Mt. Sinai. It is a great hospital. You know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and Cornell and Mt. Sinai is a great hospital. The nurses are unbelievable and Dr. Peekaboo Woo, and Dr. Allen Reid, the anesthesiologist, are fabulous.</p><p>MCCORD: Good.</p><p>IMUS: They all did a great job and I apparently do not have throat cancer. What I have are these pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCCORD: Dysplasia, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Charles knows more about what I have than I do.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, they have to remove them with a laser, and, at a high level, and they would develop into --</p><p>MCCORD: Get rid of them, that is why we get rid of them.</p><p>IMUS: And you know how I got them? Smoking.</p><p>MCCORD: Really? That is what they say? OK.</p><p>IMUS: I haven't smoked for 15 years, but -</p><p>MCCORD: Listen to that, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, so I'm fine, Bo Dietl, Jerry Greenfield.</p><p>MCCORD: That's great news to start the new year.</p><p>IMUS: Bo Dietl, still have prostate cancer but, I think I do. I'm not sure anymore whether I do or not.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, may have defeated that.</p><p>IMUS: And, I came back from the ranch on Saturday.</p><p>MCCORDs: That's 700 miles an hour with the freaking tail wind.</p><p>IMUS: What a great vacation. It's 10 degrees. We have to go out there, because we run the place. It's 10 degrees -- the wind - there's not a ski resort.</p><p>MCCORD: How about that wind?</p><p>IMUS: The wind blows and I'm not exaggerating, 60 miles an hour. Anyway, Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, Mary Matalin, coming up and we have three new radio affiliates, and when I put my glasses on I'll tell you who they are.</p><p>I'm not going to do it now and, ratings came out in New York and for people -- the ratings are broken down, all kinds of demographics and I don't believe in them but I think they give you a rough idea, of you know - - I mean, you can -- like lit-fm or one of those -- hot 97 or one of these. Whoever these stations are, that do well.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And if it is consistent over a long period of time, like when stern was on terrestrial radio, you knew he was number one, and had been on a long time, a trend that remains supported, consistency.</p><p>IMUS: So, but on these 12-plus numbers they measure people by demographics like break it down to 12 to 18, 25-54, 18-34, it is ridiculous. Men, women, all of this and there's another one they do and it is just everybody who is 12 years of age or older. And, this program, the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, is the number 2 program in New York.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get out of town!</p><p>MCCORD: Shut the front door!</p><p>IMUS: Now, of course, I told Connell and Dagen that part of that, because, they are about the only new thing we have done here, other than I have a better attitude. They were partly responsible for that and then I got to thinking about it and if it weren't for them, we could have easily been number one.</p><p>MCCORD: Number one. Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'm sorry, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Which is the reason, when I got fired, and got the job at ABC I insisted on bringing Lou and Bernie, and Charles and everybody else, because, I knew without them, I would just be -- if it weren't for them, I would be on some station, in Jersey with Uncle Floyd.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Uncle Floyd!</p><p>IMUS: I'd be on Sirius satellite radio. Mel likes me, to give me a job for 50 grand a year. And sit there -</p><p>RUFINO: At UHF --</p><p>IMUS: The I-man's blues channel, Blues and alternate country on Sirius. But, as it is -- so the show -- I've never been number 2, ever. Not back when --</p><p>MCCORD: Your best ratings.</p><p>IMUS: Not back when I was. So I'm happy about that and it is a great program. It's a better program than it ever was. Having very little to do -- not being self-effacing, having we little to do with me, Bernie, Lou, they are all great. Time for a little news and here with that is Chuck McCord. Good morning, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Good morning, I-man. Speaking of the weather, the main highway between southern and central California, shut down, both directions, blowing snow and ice from another big storm. The grapevine area of I-5 closed indefinitely, winds gusting to -- reminded me, winds, gusting to 90 miles per hour in mountain areas, and still accumulating at elevations, as low as just 1,500 feet.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>says he is honored to sign the bill to provide aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks, and first responders, all of whom --</p><p>IMUS: You know --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: \"The New York Times\" did an article about the stuff that Jon Stewart, who as you know, I like, stuff Jon Stewart did about the 9/11 bill.</p><p>MCCORD: I saw it and all of that.</p><p>IMUS: And wondering if Jon Stewart was under Edward R. Murrow, which I would hope even Jon Stewart would be embarrassed about. But perhaps he's not or we don't know because I don't know him, but I would suggest -- and it has nothing do with anything, but until Shep Smith went on the rant that he went on, as a result of seeing Jon Stewart's show, which Shep said he did, and -- hey, big foot --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS: There's the famous rap that Shep Smith did, he was talking to somebody, and he referenced Jon Stewart, and he had seen the Jon Stewart show apparently the night before, there's got to be a way to find that, right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we'll find it.</p><p>IMUS: He was -- first of all, they are both terrific, both Stewart and Shep Smith is magnificent. Few better, in fact -- I don't know if there is anybody better, but it was a respond -- did you site, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. I did --</p><p>IMUS: Am I right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: On the money, a 100 percent.</p><p>IMUS: He was absolutely spectacular.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I happened to see that.</p><p>IMUS: And it seemed to me it was spontaneous.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Certainly seemed that way.</p><p>IMUS: And the boy seemed to be articulate to me and I have to play it for you. So I think that if you are a bunch of Republicans, I -- remember I had John Thune on and he was giving me some nonsense about -- didn't wanted to rush into it.</p><p>I didn't press him hard on that, not as much as I should have, and, you know, the -- I started to say to him, you know, don't want to rush into anything and, I hope we get it before all of these people die. So, people like Senator Thune, who I am no longer supporting for anything --</p><p>MCGUIRK: That may be premature. The Republicans -- they ended up saving $3 billion from that particular bill. That is what they were holding out for, eliminate --</p><p>IMUS: They weren't going to do it until they got shamed into it by Jon Stewart and by Shep Smith, I'm saying. And when Shep Smith attacked them, I'm sure they were thinking, that is our home boy there, at Fox.</p><p>I mean, I'm sure in their minds they are thinking if we lost Shep Smith we lost the country. You would expect Jon Stewart. I thought it was magnificent what he did, by the way, but you expect him to do what he did but you wouldn't expect Shep Smith to do what he did and if you lose him you lost everybody. I mean, I'm sure they are thinking that and go that the scared into passing it, didn't they, Bernie, talking about the money they saved, because you carry water for them.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's the fact. Chuck Schumer's bill was $7 billion and, the bill ended up being $4 billion and they saved --</p><p>IMUS: But they wouldn't have done anything, had there not been those two events, am I right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Perhaps, there's no way to conclusively prove that, but it sure seems that way.</p><p>IMUS: And let me ask you this, for everybody who thinks, Sarah Palin is a moron, and I would be one of them, would you would this country be any worse off today if she were president? Answer me that. Tell me. I'm waiting --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Checkmate for the I-man.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Because, at least -- think whatever you want to think about her, and think as I do, maybe, even. I don't know that I think she is a moron but she'd have sense enough to at least ask the people rather than get the same people bush had. But, this dope has been doing -- I mean, is he still on vacation in Hawaii, by the way?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. He comes back I think late today.</p><p>IMUS: And then, on I-25, out there in Santa Fe, when you go up to the ranch into Santa Fe, before you get into Santa Fe, there was a guy has a houses -- a lot of people have houses, a guy has a house, puts up these goofy billboards, a homemade billboard.</p><p>And, makes me laugh every time, they change and he's obviously a Hannity devotee or one of them and once he has had up there for a while. Where is the birth certificate? The hand lettered dopey sign, where is the birth certificate. Here's my question -- where is it? I mean, I'm not a -- obviously I'm not one of those --</p><p>MCGUIRK: A birther?</p><p>IMUS: Of course not. But, where is it?</p><p>MCCORD: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: Isn't the governor of ha walkers wasn't he screaming all about it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's claiming --</p><p>IMUS: Where is it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, let's see it. Clear this up.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, if the guy who is supporting the president -- which I would tend to support him, too, by the way. But I just say.</p><p>MCCORD: Let's resolve this.</p><p>IMUS: Why haven't we ever seen it or why don't they produce it, I can't answer that.</p><p>IMUS: It just adds fuel to these nuts.</p><p>MCCORD: Of course it does.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, 16 after the hour, taking way too much time with my nonsense, did you do any news at all? I interrupted you, 9/11 bill.</p><p>MCCORD: The James Zadroga bill has been signed by the president there in Hawaii, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Carly? Anymore coffee? She left --</p><p>MCCORD: I'll go get you some.</p><p>IMUS: She said what did Wyatt get for Christmas and I couldn't remember, horse stuff. She said, well does she still believe in Santa Claus?</p><p>MCCORD: And your reply.</p><p>IMUS: I said, well, I still believe in Santa Claus. Why wouldn't he? You know, 17 after the hour, Warner will do a little sports and before that, a quick business update, from Connell McShane here on the Fox Business Network and on the radio as well. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man. I'm talking about the markets here, as we start off the new trading year to the up side, after a pretty good year in 2010, stocks are up, globally, this morning.</p><p>News out of China that show the economy there slowing down a little bit, seen as a good sign because it eases concerns about inflation. Anyway, the futures are up. The European markets that are open are all up and the Asian markets were up, overnight as well.</p><p>Now, as for the year in 2010, the Dow ended the year, with a gain of 11 percent, the S&amp;P was up 13 percent, and the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, with a rise of nearly 17 percent, in 2010.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning and Dagen McDowell will be along -- you guys still have your show 11:00 a.m.</p><p>MCSHANE: So far, I believe, yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK, we'll start the year, brand new year with their show and they'll still do that and, that's good. Three new radio affiliates, WAUB at 1590 and 98.1 FM, out there in Auburn, New York and WGVA, at 1240, in Geneva, New York. Finger Lakes news radio, they call that.</p><p>And, KWKC, 1340, on the AM dial, down there in Abiline, Texas, talk radio 1340 and they joined the IMUS In The Morning line-up of stations around the country beginning this morning. Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man, well, completing the NFL picture, the playoffs last night, Seattle wins the NFC West with a record of 7-9. Come on!</p><p>IMUS: Who do they play, New Orleans?</p><p>WOLF: They'll play the Saints, yes, on Saturday. You have to change the rule here very quickly. You know, forget winning the division, if you have a losing record you are not in the playoffs. You take the team with the next best record, which would have been the Giants or the Bucks at 10-6.</p><p>Earlier, the Packers beat the Bears, 10-3. The Packers, 10-6, win the final wildcard. AFC, the Colts win the AFC South, on the 43 yard field goal, last play of the game, although the Colts had won it minutes earlier when the Jags were eliminated. Steelers, win the AFC. North Falcons win the NFC South so the playoffs are all set.</p><p>Packers, Eagles, in Philadelphia and Saints and Seahawks in Seattle, Jets and Colts in Indianapolis and the Ravens and Chiefs in Kansas City, yes, did you watch any of the bowl games?</p><p>WOLF: None.</p><p>IMUS: You know, I've watched them all, except I didn't pay any attention to them because they don't mean anything.</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: Including the one -- a week from tonight, Auburn and Oregon, you make me watch that.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I'll watch that.</p><p>IMUS: I won't be watching it. So, you'll watch that?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I will.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you be at Imus on Broadway, wouldn't you want to see that?</p><p>WOLF: A conflicting time.</p><p>IMUS: It is that night. It's already sold out, so, I mean -- I could try to get you in, but -- you don't express any interest, and every day you can go to some stupid movie and routinely get a half a chicken sandwich or tuna, whatever the hell you eat, a bottle of wine and go to the gym and, see a stupid movie, park in the handicapped zone and then, go to some idiot's Broadway musical or play of some sort and yet you won't come see Imus on Broadway. That is Monday night. You will watch the stupid game between Auburn and Oregon?</p><p>WOLF: No, forget that bowl game!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Too late.</p><p>IMUS: They got to get a playoff. They have playoffs, I mean, just stupid they don't have that. Don't you agree, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Absolutely, every baseball, basketball, college, hockey and -- everything, all have playoffs, except football.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking of Imus on Broadway, Colin Quinn, who stars in long story short, which I saw which is genius stuff, directed by Jerry Seinfeld, Colin now joined the line-up of Broadway musical shows that will perform Monday night at the Hard Rock.</p><p>MCCORD: Great.</p><p>IMUS: For the Imus cattle ranch for kids with cancer. And, the legendary emcee, which I exchanged e-mails throughout the past two weeks with, Dick Cavett is our emcee and that is worth going to see, to see him.</p><p>And I'll be there, just to introduce him. I wanted to thank our title sponsor, GMC and, one place you can go to look great, feel good and feel great and a GMC sales associate will show you the latest and greatest health and fitness products. Imus on Broadway, brought do you by GMC, which we're going to tape that -- probably -- are we going to tape it, big foot, or not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We'll tape it if you want.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know, I don't know, if you can or not. Anyway, Warner Wolf sports, sponsored by American-made Peerless Boilers and the new 96 percent efficient purifier series. You have any more sports, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: There's one more thing, listen to this, I-man the Grizzlies beat the slumping Lakers last night, in L.A., by 19 points. And after the game, Phil Jackson really took it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, behind early in the third quarter, on -- stupid plays, and, Kobe has to screw up, you know, the game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one, and takes the rest of the guys out --</p><p>WOLF: Wow. Kobe's screwing up the game. Phil Jackson. That is pretty harsh.</p><p>IMUS: You know who I have become a fan of now?</p><p>WOLF: Kevin Durant?</p><p>IMUS: No. The Miami Heat. I'll tell you why --</p><p>WOLF: Why, I-man?</p><p>RUFINO: Can't wait for this.</p><p>IMUS: Shut up, Lou! I'll tell you why.</p><p>WOLF: I wonder why.</p><p>RUFINO: Miami heat, good God!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Courageous.</p><p>WOLF: It has nothing to do with the fact they've won 17 out of the last 18 and 11 in a row.</p><p>IMUS: No. No. Because, something Magic Johnson said. He said, LeBron James is playing out of his mind, and he said it is time to stop booing him. He may -- you may be unhappy that he left Cleveland and the way he went about it but, you have to get over that. The guy is a great basketball player. So, they have got that together.</p><p>MCCORD: This is why?</p><p>IMUS: What's wrong?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why didn't he go to a team that didn't have a bunch of star players and elevate them as most great players do?</p><p>IMUS: Because that wasn't our plan. It's 24 after the hour. All right, Steven Stills is 66 years old today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Looking for an investment opportunity but not sure where to start?

So, iPhone, the Apple in its iPhone seemed to fall down on the job during the first two days of 2011 when the alarms that some iPhone owners set failed to go off, leaving folks to oversleep, apparently, it was one time alarm settings, not the recurrent ones saying, Apple will not say what went wrong with it but, apparently it will be fixed from here on out. I gave my mama an iPad for Christmas.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you did?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and, she opened it up and it was sealed, bought it at the Apples store at Danbury Mall, it was sealed she opened it and it said Happy Holidays, Dennis Piper and Alan Rosenthal (ph). It was engraved by two Endodontists that worked in Norwalk, that was my mama's Christmas gift from us. She kept it though.</p><p>IMUS: I don't quite understand you. Did you Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The iPad was engraved by these two Endodontists who apparently given them to their staff or costumers and somebody returned it to the Apple store and exchange it. But Apple.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, they sold to you for.</p><p>MCDOWELL: .and they sold it to me at no discounted, I might add.</p><p>IMUS: What was the story then, the Apple store?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, Apple store, so, mama got a kick out of it. I thought it was appropriate, you know, Christmas gift, root canals, you know, spending time with your family, all kinds of seems, dove tell together.</p><p>IMUS: I thought she would have been offended that it didn't say Merry Christmas.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, no. She was probably offended by the fact we got her the cheaper one, see the Wi-Fi, we got her the one with where you can -- the AT&amp;T.</p><p>IMUS: That's the one you got to have, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Well, we chintz out on that, Merry Christmas, mama, that's it.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you take it back?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Too lazy, too much trouble.</p><p>IMUS: For your mama?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. She seems happy with it. She's fine. And, I only have to see her like twice a year, what she'll going to do about it?</p><p>IMUS: She's crying inside.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: She has to seem happy, so, she's happy that this marriage of yours is working out apparently, so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She's not happy I'm not living at home with three kids, single.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, and surprised. Thirty three minutes after the hour, time for a Bernie briefing sponsored by PC Richard and Son. And here with all of that is Bernard McGuirk. Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, chief. Well, like most of us during the break, we were either skiing in Switzerland or down in St. Barts, you know, lounging off of P. Diddy's yacht or something. So, we weren't paying attention to a lot of things. But over the break, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>apparently made a phone call as the I-man not doubt heard about to the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, and during the course of a conversation about something else, he mentioned to them that he was very happy that the owner signed their quarterback Michael Vick, who has been just tearing it up on the field, at least he was until a couple of days after this news came out. And he told him that he was glad, because a lot of ex-cons in society don't get a second chance, he was very happy for the success of Michael Vick and the fact that the guy gave him the opportunity and of course a lot of people really just can't believe that he made that kind of phony waded into this controversy unnecessarily.</p><p>IMUS: Plus he has a dog, doesn't he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Don't they have a dog?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's going to need a secret service himself now to protect him from the president.</p><p>IMUS: Michael Vick comes to the White House, well, that is unfair, that's not right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But yes, he does. And, of course, again as I said, that following Sunday, Vick played a terrible game. Not that the two had any connection.</p><p>IMUS: I don't see anything wrong with that. You don't think the president should have weighed in on it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, not at all. I think it's unnecessary again, it's just like the Beer Summit with the cop versus the Harvard professor. You just going to alienate a bunch of people, there's no reason that people now is going to take side, they'll going to hate -- if they needed a reason to hate <person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>this will give it to them, a lot of dog lovers, even though I agree, the guy deserves a second chance.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I don't know. That is working pretty hard trying to find something to wolf on Obama about.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I agree he deserves a second chance but the president should not.</p><p>IMUS: The president deserves a second chance, I'm going to give it to him now. You know, I shouldn't say this. But I actually feel like now, here in New York, we have a governor. I love David Paterson, that's sort of, I guess maybe that is not right. That's not right. Bo Dietl is coming up, we're going to talk to him. Actually, Santa brought you an extra ten pounds, huh?</p><p>RUFINO: Oh!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Thanks, Bernie. Bo Dietl is next.

You can see, we do still have rain showers here in the southwest, and snow showers in the higher elevations. Most of the U.S. is looking very clear, and as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain showers in New England along the coastline. The midsection, lots of sunshine, a slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis and as we look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to see many if any delays travel wise, because of the weather. Other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to the rain/snow mix. I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program, on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right.

I don't have the money anymore where I used to come in. I used to roll in, it doesn't roll any more. I got four iPads because you showed me this, thank God for credit cards, I got this 64 gigabyte with the Wi-Fi for my four children there. And they all got one and, you know what, we lost a great guy last year, George Steinbrenner. Now, I can tell the story. George Steinbrenner did for me like nobody else did for me. My daughter, Dana, who is the -- as a senior at the University of Tampa, at first when she tried to apply there, they only accepting a thousand students and her average was about 3.2, they told her, you have to go to another college and matriculate, she starts crying, dad, I wanted to go there, I wanted to go, I called Brandy Levine and asked Mr. Steinbrenner if he could maybe possibly help her get in. Mr. Steinbrenner got back to me and says, help her get in. Two days later, he was accepted into the University in Tampa. She now has a 4.0, she's on the Dean's list, honors society and she might become the valedictorian for the University of Tampa, my daughter Dana, I'm very proud.</p><p>IMUS: Pretty good, huh?</p><p>DIETL: And George Steinbrenner did it and my love out for the Steinbrenner family, a lot of people don't realize what he does.

Because it's a great novel.</p><p>IMUS: Talk about what you want.</p><p>DIETL: OK. \"The Chinese Conspiracy\" by John Mariotti is a new novel that is out but the novel is based on a lot of facts. We know what happened with the Pentagon, with the breaking into the Supernet computers and all of that kind of stuff, the Chinese.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>DIETL: But this talks about a group of young Chinese guys that wanted to overthrow the old Ancient guard of China.

You were going around quoting me, saying stuff that I never said. I didn't want you to stick up for me, I didn't need to be stuck up for. I didn't want people going around and making any excuses for me. There wasn't any excuse, there is no excuse now.

Who gave it to you, some friend of yours?</p><p>DIETL: He's a friend of Admiral Straw.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>DIETL: And I was at the Army-Navy game and he has a hat like you wear.</p><p>IMUS: That's not a hat like I wear.</p><p>DIETL: Well, it looks like some.</p><p>IMUS: No, it's not.</p><p>DIETL: All right. OK. And he signed you the book, I'm going to tell you about something, you talk about novel.</p><p>IMUS: He signed the book to me because he wants me to plug the book.</p><p>DIETL: No, you don't have to.</p><p>IMUS: Which I'm not now going to do, because I'm so offended that you attacked me.</p><p>DIETL: I challenged you to read this Don, because it is based on the facts about them taking over.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I'm sure it's fine.</p><p>DIETL: Taking over our country, stopping all our airlines, all our aviation, all our grid, all of that.

Coming up on five minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I was telling Charles Rangel and the Gangster Mickey that I don't weigh myself very often, occasionally I do. I weighed myself this morning and I'm about, I'm not quite 6 feet tall and I weigh 153 pounds. But because of the way I wear my wranglers, if I weigh 153 pounds and not 150 pounds, I can't get them on. So, it was just my struggle this morning.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK.

This is a horrible story. At the ranch, he gets up at 5:00 in the morning, to go out at the barn with the cowboys, and they feed all the animals. Colder than hell, it's just miserable. So, the Sunday after Christmas, there wasn't anybody there, so he does it. Even though he's only 12, he can still drive the feed truck, I mean, so we bought him his roping horse, buster, great roping horse, potentially great last summer. He goes up to the barn, he finds the horse dead in the stall.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, no.</p><p>IMUS: The horse actually out in the run -- there's (inaudible) runs outside the stall, some barns. Anyway, the horse is on his back with his leg stuck through the gate, dead. So, he comes back, running down to the house, screaming. You can imagine. His mother and I are asleep and I couldn't, I thought it was one of the dogs have died, I couldn't imagine it was his horse died. So, we buried it and put a little note in with it and oh, great.</p><p>MCCORD: It's hard.</p><p>IMUS: Between the animals and I.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: What did they -- hi, happy New Year.

Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why would they be having a reception?</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it's a big deal.</p><p>IMUS: Spend money on that.</p><p>MCCORD: That's a good point. Why -- why and in that state --</p><p>IMUS: Aren't they about $90 trillion in debt?</p><p>MCCORD: I think, $96 trillion, in the last -- in the last estimate. But you're absolutely right.</p><p>IMUS: What a mess.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK: It will be bring your own booze and crackers.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes and brown bag in it.</p><p>IMUS: Well --</p><p>MCCORD: And the top Democrat says the President will work with the Republican Congress but don't -- that doesn't mean he's going to buckle to them. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine saying that there will be disagreements.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TIM KAINE, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: If the Republicans are willing to work as they did at the end of that lame duck session I think we will see productive efforts in a number of ways.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: Kaine pointed to recent compromises on tax cuts, and this new START treaty as proof of the possibility at least of some demonstration of bipartisanship.</p><p>And researchers are making progress on a blood test that is interesting, to say the least. They say this will be able to spot a single cancer cell among as many as a billion healthy ones. The health care company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the giant company says it will join scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital where the test was invented, to try to bring this thing to market within the next several years.</p><p>Researchers think the test has the potential at least to transform care of many types of cancer, especially breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer. Doctors hope to use it to determine what treatment would be best for any particular tumor or set of tumors.</p><p>Magnitude 7.1 earthquake, southern Chile, yesterday, prompted tens of thousands to flee the coast for higher ground thinking that it might be generating another tsunami like the one that ravaged the area last year. There were no reports, though, of deaths, no tsunami alert was actually issued.</p><p>A statement with the geological survey says the epicenter was about 45 miles away from the provincial capital of Temuco (ph) the population of about a quarter million people.</p><p>IMUS: You know the thing is around the world.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And some of these various people like in Chile who already got screwed in the -- in the genetic lottery. Well, not the genetic lottery, but the geographical lottery --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- by -- and then have to endure this.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Like Haiti, for example.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: And Africa and -- these various places around the world, just get -- but just get screwed by one hideous catastrophe after another.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: It is 13 after the hour; Warner, do you have sports?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. We'll get to that in a second first, let's check the business news and with that, Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Ok, good morning, I-Man.</p><p>The market coming up at 11 percent gain in 2010 at least for the DOW and nearly 17 percent rise for the NASDAQ, up again this morning indicating the New Year will start off on a good note.</p><p>Then, there's a big story in the \"New York Times\" this morning about Facebook, Goldman Sachs making a $500 million investment in Facebook according to \"The Times\" and a Russian investor also making a sizable investment and so the -- the value of Facebook according to these investments would now be around $50 billion.</p><p>So Facebook would be worth more as \"The Times\" points out, than big tech companies like eBay and Yahoo! and many others, but anyway, Facebook which has obviously been a hot company for some time is getting a big investment now from the -- one of the best known firms on -- or the best known firm on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: And the -- the two twins from Harvard who are -- the rowing twins out there in San Diego.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- who are suing what's his name?</p><p>MCSHANE: Zuckerberg.</p><p>IMUS: Yes they must be happy about this latest development.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, we'll see. Well, they want -- they want their suit, they settled it already for tens of millions of dollars but they want it now to be thrown out so that their shares can be valued higher but Facebook has won every legal challenge of that case which is of course the subject of the movie, the \"Social Network\".</p><p>IMUS: Well, the Connell McShane business report sponsored by Gorilla Trades. Get powerful stock picks for 30 days, sign up now at GorillaTrades.com. It's 14 after the hour.</p><p>Well, Charles had reported that the 9/11 responder bill was signed and \"The New York Times\" had what I thought was kind of an amusing article, particularly for those of us who are fans of Jon Stewart. I suspect Mr. Stewart probably thought it was amusing as well, but Bill Carter who writes all of these books about the late night wars as though somebody cares -- judging by the best-seller list, no one does.</p><p>Compared Mr. Stewart to Everett R. Murrow, which because of Mr. Stewart's rants about the Republicans, who wouldn't support the 9/11 responders bill and which I thought he was right about. But, I thought what made the Republicans come around, of course, Bernie's now claiming that they were able to get $3 billion out of the bill, so that they were -- so that they would pass it. But, whether they would have got that out or not, they were shamed into passing it.</p><p>But I thought when Shep Smith from Fox News was on Fox News, of course. And he had seen the Jon Stewart Show the night before. And so he was talking about it. And when -- he did this spontaneous wrap about how shameful it was that the Republicans were dragging their feet, refusing to pass the bill, and I saw him when he did it. And it appeared to be spontaneous but, in my view, the Republicans watching this could have endured Jon Stewart ragging on them and would have, because it happens all the time.</p><p>But, boy, I would be willing to bet when they turned on Fox News with the huge audience that they have and here's Shep Smith with his -- huge audience that he has. And they lost him, then they've lost the fight. Here's Shep Smith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Last night on Jon Stewart -- it was Jon Stewart's last show of the week and ok, we watched it, whatever. And he just flat on -- absolutely right and it's worth saying, who's going to hold these people's feet to the fire when we're able to put a 52-story building down there so far at Ground Zero.</p><p>We're able to pay for tax cuts from billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the economy but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire? Went down there to save people?</p><p>Did people know what the city was like that day; people walking over bridges, they were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying. Their family members were dead and these people ran to Ground Zero to save people's lives. And we're not going to give them medicine for the illnesses they got down there?</p><p>It is disgusting, it's a national disgrace. It's a shame and everybody who voted against it should have to stand up and account for him or herself. Is anybody going to hold them accountable?</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I think you just did.</p><p>SMITH: I'm not really in a position to do that. I mean I think I just kind of went out there and said what the truth is. And I feel like, I feel like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people.</p><p>There was no warning label on Ground Zero, on 9/11 that these substances will kill you. And even if there had been they would have gone anyway. They just need a little bit of help.</p><p>It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do, doing anything for those people, don't we?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: That is Shep Smith, Fox News. That is big time -- tell me about Fox News.</p><p>MCGUIRK: With Chris Wallace.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Well, he's just sitting there, sucking his thumb --</p><p>MCGUIRK: You had brought that up with Chris Wallace prior to that conversation and then that following Sunday, Chris Wallace brought it up to several politician on his program as well.</p><p>IMUS: That is big time, Shep Smith. You know, and all the Lobster Newburghs of the world. Those of you who run around and won't watch Fox News --</p><p>MCCORD: Pay attention.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, pay attention. They're not doing that -- I didn't see Diane Sawyer doing that. I didn't see that wimp, who by the way won't be in the \"Profiles in Courage\" book, Brian Williams. I didn't see him or the little rodent over there at CBS doing anything.</p><p>Did you? Did you see any of them? Did they have a word to say about that? Who did have a word to say about it? Shep Smith.</p><p>So -- 19 after the hour. Get to Warner in sports in a minute. Calm down.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: In the news this morning, Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its Web site. It's the latest development in this conflict that has been growing between the airlines and on-line travel agencies since American cut ties with Orbitz. The airline says Expedia intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.</p><p>American is looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own Web sites in an effort to save money. Expedia says the move will only cost them ticket sales and believes American's efforts are bad for travelers. Well, there you have it.</p><p>Stocks starting off the New Year with some gains here after a monthly survey in China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and that's worked to ease some inflation concerns.</p><p>Over in Europe this morning, stocks are higher and London is closed for a New Year's holiday but both Paris and Frankfurt are gaining ground.</p><p>Our futures are also higher, ahead of the open on Wall Street which is coming a little over two hours from now. We're up 67 points on Dow futures.</p><p>And commodities, oil is up at $92 a barrel; and gold down, just slightly.</p><p>So, that's a look at some of your top stories and now over to Charles for more of this morning's top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: And they include today, Connell, this -- another big storm hitting southern California; snow and 90 mile-an-hour winds were reported in some locations and authorities have shut done the so-called grapevine portion of I-5, north of Los Angeles.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>signing into law the measure that passes -- that pays, rather, for medical care for first responders to the 9/11 terror attacks, New York, '01. The legislation sets up this $4 billion compensation fund to help those people.</p><p>And a top navy officer under fire for producing and appearing in a series of raunchy orientation videos, broadcast to nearly 6,000 crewmembers of the USS Enterprise. In the videos Captain Owen Honors and other crewmembers can be seen cursing and using anti-gay slurs among other things.</p><p>Those are some of the headlines as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues now right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty-five after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It's a prime example Bernard, of what I was talking to you about off the air.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right. Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: Idiot sales department (INAUDIBLE) -- they're all talking about it now. They write these commercials and the commercials are 90 seconds long, but they pay for 60 seconds.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So I read for 60 seconds and then I stop reading so I don't know what they want left in or out or who knows.</p><p>MCCORD: Essential information, right.</p><p>IMUS: And I want to help them out, one of them is for GNC, it's a great nutrition center, they're great.</p><p>I have no idea what they -- by the way, at this point if they're not on top of it and the stupid sales department at the radio station is not, then, I can't be worried about it.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Too much.</p><p>IMUS: And now I've got myself all worked up here and I was doing fine up to now.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Time for sports and here with that is the great Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Good morning. Thank you, I-man.</p><p>Well, completing the play-off picture last night, the Seahawks finishing 7- 9, beat the Rams 16-6; they win the NFC west. And as you said, even the Seattle fans wanted the Seahawks to lose so they would get a higher draft pick.</p><p>The Packers win the wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3. The Colts win the AFC south, beating the Titans, 23-20. Although they didn't know it at the time, they had already won it minutes earlier because the Jags lost. Steelers win the AFC. Falcons win the NFC.</p><p>And finally, I-man, MVP, there's going to be no question about it, Tom Brady finishes with 36 touchdowns and just four interceptions.</p><p>IMUS: How did he play -- he's playing better than he ever has.</p><p>WOLF: Ever, all-time. Not anytime.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>WOLF: Not every time --</p><p>IMUS: That will be fine.</p><p>WOLF: Not Greenwich Time.</p><p>IMUS: That will be fine. Time for a little business news now, oh, my God. And here with that is the girl with the purple dress on, purple rain, purple rain. Dagen McDowell -- good morning Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir. I was trying to get all gussied up for your return.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm glad you did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. At least I came back from Christmas with all my teeth because there's always that danger.</p><p>IMUS: How would you lose your teeth?</p><p>MCDOWELL: A fight, fall down or there's always that, you know, peanut brittle sitting around the house.</p><p>IMUS: Or Santa come down that chimney and you're there under the tree and haven't been rubbing that Chamonix on yourself and so Santa would be disappointed, wouldn't he? And look like you been left out in the rain, girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He would punch me -- would punch me in the mouth.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let's hope not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: For not keeping my skin soft and supple.</p><p>IMUS: Well, anyway, what's going on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. The movie business was boo -- bad last year. Overall attendance was down more than 5 percent; the lowest number of tickets sold to the movies since 1996. Now, total revenue was north of $10 billion because ticket prices are higher. People are going to 3-D movies, which cost more money, but one, one notable disappointment was that Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolie movie \"The Tourist\" at end of the year. So, I reckon paying have gotten tired of paying to see that hussy with the puffy lips stand around.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you offing (ph) on her.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: You don't like her --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't. No, not at all.</p><p>IMUS: You know who seems kind of cute is Reese Witherspoon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, that movie didn't do so well either; that new movie that she's in.</p><p>IMUS: She's going to marry her agent, you know. Did you know that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Yes, I did. Jim Toff (ph) is his name, by the way.</p><p>IMUS: And how about Shania Twain?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Getting married to the ex-husband of the woman that Mutt Lang, Shania's ex-husband, left her for. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Now, that's a trailer park --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RUFINO: I'm my own grandpa right there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you know what? That's why you got to love her.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. All's well that ends well. She grew up hard knocks, man. Now she's found love.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, I know she did. Yes. I thought she's good. I've always liked her, but the girl -- she married Mutt Lange who produced all her records.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And he -- didn't he produce Def Leppard for a long time?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, he did.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Foreigner.</p><p>IMUS: Foreigner. So he's a great record producer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: But apparently that wasn't enough and she wasn't enough. So he was having an affair with her assistant, right, or his assistant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. She was like the house manager, I thought, something like that.</p><p>IMUS: OK. And so, Shania, of course, found out about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it was Shania's best friend.</p><p>IMUS: And Shania's best friend. Sure.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: So he was always there, that's unfortunate. So now, are they married now?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know if they're married.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now, but that woman's ex-husband, they are married, OK. Mutt and the woman -- Mutt and the woman are married and the woman's ex-husband just married Shania.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel dizzy right now.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: Now, Shania, she's down in Nashville. There's a bunch of people available, a bunch of these good looking cowboy singers. And I just, I just didn't understand that. That's sort of screwed up, isn't it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, he's hot.</p><p>IMUS: He is?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The guy she married is smoking, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's like -- yes, he's European looking. He's --</p><p>IMUS: He's cute?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, all right. Well, never mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And those cowboys will cheat on you quicker than they'll sneeze, so why drive down that road again?</p><p>IMUS: Well, Mutt Lange is not a cowboy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know, but the cowboys will cheat, too. Find a man who will stay honest to you.</p><p>IMUS: Like Tim McGraw, he married, down the road with what's her name. Figure, well, why not, so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What a tough decision for him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Faith Hill or hmmm -- I wonder --</p><p>IMUS: Years ago -- years ago, my brother and Phil Sweet wrote a song called \"\"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You, which eventually went to number one. It won the Music City News Record of the Year, country record, and is recorded by Jim Ed Brown of The Browns, you know. And Helen Cornelius.</p><p>Now, Helen, she was married. Well, you know where this story is going. And so was Jim, he was married. But they get this big hit record \"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You\", I don't want to have to say I do. And so they're on tour and they're on the bus and they discovered some -- one of them, one of the husbands or either her husband or his wife discovered that between the two compartments on the bus where Jim Ed Brown would sleep and where the other compartment where old Helen was asleep, there was a trap door.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: No way.</p><p>IMUS: There's like a, where your dog comes in and out. So one of them was wiggling through the trap door.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, for crying out loud.</p><p>IMUS: I don't want to have to marry you.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. I don't have to go through that trap door.</p><p>IMUS: Man, oh, man.</p><p>All right, 33 after the hour. Jeff Greenfield is coming up. But first, time for a briefing sponsored by our friends at P.C. Richard &amp; Son. And here with that is Bernard McGuirk.</p><p>Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yo, chief. Well, a lot happened since the break began for us a couple of weeks ago. The Bush tax cuts extended, \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" repealed. The death panels are back and Obamacare and the blizzard of 2010 further revealed Mayor Mike Bloomberg could be the arrogant schmuck we all knew he was.</p><p>IMUS: Two best news. The \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and the 9/11 responder bill.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. That was signed just yesterday by the president in Hawaii, robbing Chuck Schumer of his moment in the spotlight. He couldn't be there at the signing. However, before all this happened, Larry King signed off and during that show, a funny thing happened while Larry King was interviewing Bill Clinton which pretty much went unnoticed. They were talking about both being heart surgeon patients, members of the \"zipper club\" but that was a little confusing. But here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOICE OF: LARRY KING, HOST, \"LARRY KING LIVE\": You look well fit. Are you feeling well?</p><p>VOICE OF: BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I feel great. I've been traveling quite a bit, but as you pointed out I just got back from Haiti. And I'm kind of like you, I have to keep working. I don't know if it keeps me young, but at least it keeps me out of the grave.</p><p>KING: We're both in the \"zipper club.\" By the way, the suits want me to remind you what the \"zipper club\" is. It's if you've had open heart surgery, they have to zipper it up. So I thought everyone in the world knew it but apparently --</p><p>CLINTON: I'm glad you clarified that.</p><p>KING: I see what you mean. Oh, oh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: The big dog acknowledging and can be self-deprecating at this point.</p><p>IMUS: Of course, we lost a character when Larry -- what's Larry going to do now?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, he's still going to work. He's going to be a contributor.</p><p>He better, right. He has to be.</p><p>IMUS: Wasn't he ragging on Hannity and Rachel Maddow?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He did somewhere. I read something about that. He was --</p><p>IMUS: Both of them were kicking his ass, by the way. Hannity by a lot and her by some.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Hannity drove Larry King off the air, essentially.</p><p>IMUS: So he gets on. He's bad-mouthing Rachel Maddow and Hannity who were both killing him.</p><p>All right, Greenfield is next. Twenty-five until the hour.</p><p>MUSIC: Oh, I love the clothes she wears and the way the sunlight plays upon her hair. Oh, I hear the sound of a church bell off the wind that lifts her perfume through the air. I'm picking up good vibrations. She's giving me the excitations. I'm picking up good vibrations.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm so irritable this morning that I just don't know if I can recover.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: The bailout program for boring radio.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the FOX Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: All right. Here's your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>As many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's day, there was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock features. Users have set their alarm for a single wakeup. Found it didn't go off when 2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all alarms will work properly starting today. But apparently users in Europe and Asia say they are still having some problems.</p><p>Vizio, the maker of inexpensive flat-screen TVs looking now to expand. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell phones and tablet computers. The two products, the Via Phone and the Via Tablet will be introduced this summer from the company. The announcement comes days ahead of the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.</p><p>As for the markets this morning, let's check in on the futures once again. They've been higher all morning long. Dow futures now up by 84 points as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p>SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning. I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast.</p><p>You can see we do still have rain showers here in the southwest and snow showers in the higher elevations. Most of the U.S. is looking very clear. And as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain showers in New England along the coastline. The midsection, lots of sunshine. A slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis. And as we look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to see very many if any delays travel-wise because of the weather, other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to that rain- snow mix.</p><p>I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Nineteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Mary Matlin is coming up. Tomorrow, Tom Friedman. And then on Wednesday, Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus, \"Blond on Blond.\" This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by Time Warner cable business class. You first, the technology follows.</p><p>Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from CBS News, Jeff Greenfield. Good morning, Mr. Greenfield.</p><p>JEFF GREENFIELD, CBS NEWS (via telephone): Good morning, Don. Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Happy New Year to you. I apologize for being late.</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know, it's -- I mean, I would not have missed the conversation about all those country stars and their lives for anything. So it was fine, you know?</p><p>IMUS: I sense a note of sarcasm in your voice.</p><p>GREENFIELD: No. Me, on this show? Don't be silly.</p><p>IMUS: It just hurts my feelings because --</p><p>GREENFIELD: No, you are the audio version of Oprah's new network. Nothing but good feelings.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder how that's going to work out for her.</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know, I don't know. It's in a way unprecedented that an entire network is built around the appeal of one person although she's hardly, you know, your ordinary figure. And I guess it involves everything from whether or not some of her viewers are going to want to pay the extra fee. She's not on pay cable, but on a lot of network, a lot of cable systems she's not on the basic cable. There is some fluff about that. And the real question is, I guess, can you sustain 24 hours based on the world view of one person although as I say in her case that's just one extraordinary media figure. I mean, she certainly has built something over the years that is just unprecedented in, you know, media. So good luck to her.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I like her. I don't know why I like her. I don't watch her show, I just like her.</p><p>GREENFIELD: She's a -- I can say -- I think, I think you don't connect at that level with so many people at that level of intensity unless there's something there, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe Barbara Walters should have asked her if she was a lesbian?</p><p>GREENFIELD: I don't know, Don. Let me take that under prayerful consideration.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder what you thought. I didn't so, I like Barbara Walters, too.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, OK.</p><p>IMUS: So the 9/11 responders bill is signed that finally, huh?</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, and I think you were very wise in showing that clip from Shep Smith, because I think between him and Stuart, you had -- I think Shep is a straight arrow newscaster, but certainly the FOX Network is watched overwhelmingly by folks of a conservative persuasion and Stuart's show is watched overwhelmingly by folks with a liberal persuasion. When you have people on both sides coming at that issue and basically saying shame to the people who voted against it, I think those twin factors played a big role in getting that bill through.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know if many Democrats watch FOX News somewhere?</p><p>GREENFIELD: No, they do, because, first of all, FOX News as a cable network is by far the most watched cable network, and it isn't that Democrats don't watch it. But in the surveys that I have seen over the years and it shouldn't surprise anybody, the predominantly majority view of those who watch tends to the right. It's just the predominant view of those who watch MSNBC tends to the left. And this is about reassurance and reaffirmation of what you believe is right.</p><p>I may have told you the story. I talked once to a Democratic senator who told me that the television set is always on at MSNBC at home. And I said why after 12 hours of debate in the Senate, you go home and watch more politics? And the answer was, it's like soaking in a nice warm bath, you know. And I think that's true for a lot of people who turn on a cable news network, that basically tells them what you basically think that's right. And I think it's one of the reasons why my former places of business, CNN, had such a prime time ratings. There are a lot of others, but people basically I think, that is to say the people who watch cable news, and remember it's a big minority of television viewers. You're talking about three percent of, you know, television homes. Folks turn that stuff on either to be told they're right or in the case of, you know, Democrats watching FOX or Republicans watching MSNBC to get the blood going.</p><p>IMUS: I was so happy we were able to get you away from CNN over to CBS. I can't tell you.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, I'm sure you played your part.</p><p>IMUS: I hated the fact. Well, I kept saying to Rick Kaplan, who was a big fan of yours, by the way, as are a lot of people.</p><p>GREENFIELD: He's now one of my bosses. He's the executive producer of Katie Couric's show.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you be -- why wouldn't we get Greenfield over to CBS News and get him out of that hell hole over there.</p><p>GREENFIELD: The only thing I can tell you is the cafeteria at CNN was much better than the cafeteria at CBS.</p><p>IMUS: Did you watch the Rose Bowl?</p><p>GREENFIELD: I did, that's my alma mater.</p><p>IMUS: That's what I asked.</p><p>GREENFIELD: I thought it was a really good game. I was the only big 10 team that was competitive I think in all those -- how many bowl games are there now? About 35 quite literally?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD: So it's one missed field goal.</p><p>IMUS: That was my only connection to the game is I knew that you had gone to school there before you went to Harvard or Yale, wherever the hell you went.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, right.</p><p>IMUS: And that they were playing TCU. Of course, I was rooting for TCU, but that's just because I'm a big Texas fan. So --</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, Bob Schieffer is. In fact, I regretted the fact that he and I didn't get a bet down. Although now that Wisconsin lost, I don't know would have had to -- I don't know what I would have had to do, you know, appeared on the air in a TCU warm-up jacket. I guess that was a really good game and I must say that, you know, I didn't, I didn't call the University of Wisconsin in high dungeon and say no more contributions from me because you lost the football game. That's perhaps taking it a bit too far.</p><p>IMUS: If you're one of the people like I am who thinks that Sarah Palin is -- I don't know if I think she's a dope or not, but whatever. But let me ask you this, how much worse off would the country or better off would the country be where she president?</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know what?</p><p>IMUS: The answer is not --</p><p>GREENFIELD: First of all -- no, first, she's dumb like a fox. I mean, here's somebody who's turned the governorship of Alaska and an unsuccessful bid for vice-president into a multi-million dollar empire where she gets to talk only to people who like her for $100,000 a more pop, you know, is a favorite on the most watched cable news network in the country and makes millions of dollars selling books. This is how dumb she is.</p><p>IMUS: Very good.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, that's --</p><p>Two Cadillacs outside.</p><p>IMUS: You remember.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking of when people talk about how dumb he is, that preacher guy.</p><p>One of my favorite routines. But you know, that's a question probably better asked to people who -- who would ideologically tend to be on her side. I think it's really interesting that either a majority or maybe close to of Republicans don't think she's qualified to be president.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD: So what she has is an enormously intensely loyal base of people who like her and think any criticism of her is just an example of left wing media bias.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe it's a little like Oprah. We all like her but we just don't want her to run anything.</p><p>All right. I've got to go, but thank you very much.</p><p>GREENFIELD: -- that analogy completely, but I do think that she's going to have a significant role whether she's a candidate or not in 2012.</p><p>IMUS: All right. I've got to go.</p><p>GREENFIELD: OK. Well, Happy New Year and it's two months to start plugging my book like a banshee (ph).</p><p>IMUS: I will do anything for you. Jeff Greenfield, CBS News.</p><p>MUSIC: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: The stocks starting off the new year with some gains here. The monthly survey coming out of China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and that actually is easing some inflation concerns and some optimism about our economy as well, ahead of some key economic data points later in the week. Europe is up across the board. London is closed today for the New Year's holiday. And our futures are up across the board. The Dow futures ahead of the open on Wall Street now up almost triple digits. So we're adding to the gains as we get closer to the open.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants to put on the market.

You're a professional comedian.</p><p>BARTLETT: I happen to come up with something else. He's a great character. You don't want to lose him.</p><p>MCCORD: He's still going to be around doing specials and stuff. He's just not going to have a show.</p><p>TONY POWELL: You're going to make him to do whatever --</p><p>BARTLETT: We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>BARTLETT: We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS: Well, yes, but that's different.</p><p>MCCORD: That's Nixon.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, it's Nixon.</p><p>IMUS: It's Nixon.</p><p>MCCORD: No, but you --</p><p>IMUS: You're saying we can still do Larry King?</p><p>BARTLETT: Why not? It's not like he's dead.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, he is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: But that's been for a while.</p><p>IMUS: He's a no-good bastard, by the way.</p><p>MCCORD: Who?</p><p>IMUS: Larry King.

So I say to Carly, I want a -- I'm drinking this tea that is supposed to kill cancer cells.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So -- and I'm happy to do it. So I said I wanted another cup. So she just brings over an empty cup, you know --</p><p>MCSHANE: Good for her. You deserve that.</p><p>IMUS: But I -- because I didn't specify what I wanted.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But it turns out we're out of the tea, so -- anyway, Seahawks won the football game last night, in case you just turned your -- whatever you have on, on. Your toaster.</p><p>MCSHANE: Your toaster.</p><p>IMUS: And --</p><p>MCSHANE: Seven and nine in the playoffs.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, which doesn't make any sense to me, but I don't care. So, are you a football fan, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, I'm a Jet fan. I was at the Jet game yesterday with my son and it was fun. And they won their -- well, they were already in the playoffs, but they won. So they go 11-5.</p><p>IMUS: Why would you pick a game to go to that meant nothing?</p><p>MCSHANE: Because you know why -- that's actually a good point. But we hadn't been to a game at the new stadium yet. So I decided on Saturday, the weather wasn't going to be too cold and he had never been to a game at the new stadium, so let's go. So we went.</p><p>IMUS: What kind of seats did you have?</p><p>MCSHANE: We had good seats. We were right behind -- they were actually in the second row -- they were technically in the 11th row but they were right behind the tunnel, you know, where the players run in. So they were in the second row behind that tunnel in the end zone and three of the touchdowns were right in our end zone, right where we were sitting. So it was pretty cool.</p><p>IMUS: Did you buy the tickets?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I bought them on -- I just bought them on Stub Hub the day before the game, online.</p><p>IMUS: Wouldn't there be some way, if you were going to go, you could -- you could let me know and then we could call Warner --</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And have you sit in the box with the owner?</p><p>MCSHANE: You know what, but then I'd owe you something.</p><p>IMUS: You owe me a lot now, by the way, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I do.

Stocks -- starting off the year, really. It's the first trading day of the year with some gains. There's a monthly survey out of China that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months, and that's easing concerns about inflation. If you look at Asia, for example, the Shanghai composite, the Chinese market at the bottom of the screen, up 1.75 percent. Kospi in South Korea, Hang Seng in Hong Kong all up on the day. Japan has not yet resumed trading in the new year.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are up. London's close also today because of the New Year's holiday. Paris is up 2 percent. Look at that. Germany up 1.3 percent. And our futures indicating the open on Wall Street in an hour and a half is going to be significantly higher. Dow futures up almost triple digits, up 92 points.</p><p>All right. Now, in terms of how we fared last year, as it is, in 2010, there's the recap. The Dow up 11 percent. The S&amp;P almost 13 percent. And the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, higher by almost 17 percent.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on even more debt.

You know, the debt ceiling is not -- is not something to toy with. That's the -- the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that's the -- essentially defaulting on our obligations, which is totally unprecedented in American history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree that it needs to be raised, but many are also saying they wouldn't go along with that unless they get promises to change Washington's spending habits. They argue there's no point in even having a debt ceiling if it's simply raised every time the national debt gets close.</p><p>Bank of America taking a $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter.

(INAUDIBLE) here. What's the matter with you?</p><p>It is five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Mary Matalin is coming up.</p><p>Well, I can't hear you. We're trying to -- we're sitting here talking about the guy who does the \"Red Eye\" show on the Fox News Channel. It's on at 3:00 a.m. Gary --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Greg.</p><p>IMUS: Gray --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Gutfield.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfield.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Or Feld. Feld, actually.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfeld.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I said, I had a suspicion that he might be pretty good. My wife says he is. And now here's how he came to my attention, because I was watching the Fox New Year's Eve thing. I was out at the ranch.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I was watching <person><nameText>Megyn Kelly, </nameText></person>who I like, and Bill Hemmer, who I like him, too. And they were just way too happy. I mean that girl was so happy, she was beside herself. And she's about 29 months pregnant. So she's got the baby coming up here.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: And they were just hysterical. Now, I didn't stay with them to see the ball come down, because I don't do that. If you -- if you watch the ball come down --</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: You can't be a bigger loser in life. You can't do it. And if you're there, most of the people in Times Square itself are from somewhere else. They're tourists. They're not -- there's no New Yorkers who I know, and I've been here for a long time, 30 years, who go there and stand there and, you know, let people pee on you while they -- while you're waiting for the ball to come down. I just don't think that happens, do you, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's not going to happen.</p><p>IMUS: All right. So, I was asking about -- so, anyway, he was on, the \"Red Eye\" guy, not the radio red eye guy, the other one, the TV \"Red Eye\" guy. And so we -- I thought, well, let's have him on. Let's have him as a guest. But first we have to find -- I mean I'm not interested in -- we didn't get to be a successful as we are by experimenting, although we did used to do that. But we don't do that anymore. We don't experiment with talent. So, I guess, what's the matter, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: There's something on your shoulder, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: There is?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, on your --</p><p>MCSHANE: Your coming apart.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you know, hey, Connell --</p><p>MCCORD: Uh-oh.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, Trevor. You know what happened?</p><p>MCGUIRK: (INAUDIBLE). Damn it, someone!</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Easy mistake.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Can you hear us now, chief? He can't hear us.</p><p>IMUS: No, I can't hear you, you little bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, thanks for telling us.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Connell, this thing -- I mean, Trevor, this thing came loose again.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'll fix it for you.</p><p>IMUS: Well, actually, he can fix it.</p><p>All right, time for a little news and here with that --</p><p>MCSHANE: Is Trevor.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter?</p><p>MCCORD: Just the ongoing saga of the ear monitors.</p><p>IMUS: These are my $1,500 ear monitors.</p><p>MCCORD: There's something every freakin' 15 minutes.</p><p>IMUS: That won't stay together.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But what about Greg Gutfeld?</p><p>IMUS: Well, we're going to watch him -- I'm going to watch his show tonight --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: And if he's any good, we'll have him on. I bet he must be, wouldn't you think? Have you ever seen it, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. I have not really seen the show. It's on, as you said, 3:00 in the morning, no.</p><p>IMUS: My wife says he's good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And Opie, Anthony -- Anthony's on a lot, right?</p><p>BARTLETT: Supposedly.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we know Anthony's funny. I'll listen (ph).</p><p>Here's Chuck with the news.</p><p>MCCORD: The president says he is honored to have signed the bill to provide the aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks and first responders who became ill working at Ground Zero. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, named after a police officer who died of a respiratory disease that he contracted during the 9/11 operations, his father now says he is happy others will finally be getting the help they need.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an important not only because my son was sick for four years, you know, and we watched him die and we couldn't get no help for him. Now -- there was -- no one would recognize that he was sick from the World Trade Center.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: The bill provides $4.2 billion in help to sick workers and several hundred people who live near the burning pile, the toxicity at the World Trade Center ruins. The president signing the measure in private as his Hawaiian vacation neared its end.</p><p>IMUS: Bill Carter, a journalist from \"The New York Times,\" who's a nice guy, by the way. Writes all these books about the late night talk show wars that nobody cares about and no one reads. And -- but they're good. I guess I read them. (INAUDIBLE). He and some other clown wrote an article over the past couple of weeks about Jon Stewart being perhaps the new Edward R. Murrow --</p><p>MCCORD: Crusader.</p><p>IMUS: Which I suspect even Mr. Stewart, who I am a fan of --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Found amusing. If not ironic, except every time I use the word ironic, with apologies to Nora Ephron, I always wonder if I'm using it correctly.</p><p>MCCORD: Correct.</p><p>IMUS: And I suspect I'm not. But at any rate, because Stewart was railing about the Republicans who had embraced tragedy of 9/11 as almost their campaign mantra slogan deal, and that they were not entitled to do that anymore because essentially they had refused, which I thought was a disgrace and so did Mr. Stewart. So he talked about it. Then he had some of the responders on. So they were, Mr. Carter and some other dope from \"The Times,\" were crediting Mr. Stewart with providing the impetus for this to be passed, which I thought, well, it might have brought some attention to it, but it certainly didn't spur any Republicans to change their minds about it or to feel some sort of necessity to take action on this and to realize how absolutely disgraceful they were behaving.</p><p>But I saw Shep Smith -- I played this last hour and it's worth playing again. I'll tell you why. Because he does the news on -- he does the news two hours on it on the Fox News Channel. And some of my friends, like Esther Newberg, I love her to death, but is one of these elitist, liberal snobs who, you know, they all think they have all the answers and she's one of these people who refuses to watch Fox News because she thinks they have some sort of agenda and yet, like a moron, she'll watch MSNBC or CNN, who are both dreadful and disgraceful and clearly do have an agenda or, say, CBS or ABC or, for God's sake, NBC.</p><p>So I would call her attention, and I would call to Mr. Carter's attention as well, what Shep Smith had to say about it. And Shep Smith -- I'm going to play it in a second -- referenced Jon Stewart. What I think is significant about it is, is that if you're a Republican like John Thune, I had that dope on, and some of these other people who were dragging their feet and just refusing to vote on this, and Senator Thune had these lame excuses that he gave me. And much to my discredit, I didn't press him on it and should have, but I thought, well, he didn't want to rush into anything and it was too much other money was -- it was a bunch of pork and stuff in it and even that was kind of Bernie's rap on this. And people like Hannity and some of these other dopes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Those are the facts.</p><p>IMUS: The facts are nothing. The point is -- the facts are stupid. The point is, it should have been passed and, of course, now it was passed and they did take out about $3 billion of pork.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: My point, God, if I could make the point, is that when Shep Smith talked about it, that got the attention of all of the Republicans and everyone else, because they're thinking, if Shep Smith, with that enormous audience that he has and that Fox News has, if he's against this, then as Walter Cronkite famously said or Lyndon Johnson said about Walter Cronkite during the Vietnam War, if we've lost him, we've lost the country. Here's Shep Smith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS: Last night on Jon Stewart, it was Jon Stewart's last (INAUDIBLE) of the week and, OK, we watch it. Whatever. And he's just flat on, absolutely right. And it's worth saying, who's going to hold these people's feet to the fire when we -- you know, we're able to put a 52 story building down there so far at Ground Zero. We're able to pay for tax cuts for billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the economy, but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire, went down there to save people. The people knew what this city was like that day. People were walking over bridges. They were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying. Their family members were dead. And these people ran to Ground Zero to stave people's lives. And we're not going to even give them medicine for the illnesses that they got down there. It's disgusting. It's a national disgrace. It's a shame. And everybody who voted against it should have to stand up and account for himself or herself. Is anybody going to hold them accountable?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you just did.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I'm not really in a position to do that. I mean I think I just kind of went out there and said what the truth is and I feel like -- I feel like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people. There was no warning label on Ground Zero on 9/11 \"these substances will kill you.\" And even if there had been, they'd have gone anyway. They just need a little bit of help. It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do doing anything for those people, don't we?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: So that's Shep Smith, Fox News. So the next time one of you want to tell me about Fox News, I'm going to tell you about Shep Smith. That's what I'm talking about.</p><p>Now, I didn't see Diane Sawyer and I didn't see that coward Brian Williams or that little rodent over there. Well, we don't need to get into name calling, Don.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, why are we?</p><p>IMUS: Or the very lovely Katie Couric --</p><p>MCCORD: Better.</p><p>IMUS: Or the -- well, not so courageous, that's a better way to put it, Brian Williams. Did you ever -- did -- what -- did they say anything about it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, of course not. Were they railing about it at MSNBC? Well, of course not. So that's what I'm talking about. So if you're the John Thunes of the world and you turn that on -- it's on all the time here -- if you see Shep Smith calling you out --</p><p>MCCORD: Then, wait a minute.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, Chris Wallace in there sucking his thumb, thinking, oh, I hope I don't get in trouble.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, he brought it up on the Sunday show.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, quarter after the hour. Time for a little sports now.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And the (INAUDIBLE) Democrats controlled Congress for two years, with the Democratic president, and they waited till the lame duck session to try to pass this (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>IMUS: Save all that for next time you're on Hannity.</p><p>It's 16 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I'll get an e-mail from Hannity.</p><p>Did we do your business report yet, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: Not yet, I don't think.</p><p>IMUS: No, OK, we can do it in a minute. Don't worry about it.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK, I'm not.</p><p>IMUS: Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf.</p><p>Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Well, they completed the playoff picture last night. The lonely Seattle Seahawks finishing 7-9, beat the Rams 16-6. They win the NFC West. Change the rule, man. Forget winning the division, you can't have a losing record. You're out. Replaced by the non-playoff team with the best record. The Giants, by the way, will bring back Tom Coughlin.</p><p>Packers win their final wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3.. That eliminated the Giants. The Colts win the AFC South, beat the Titans 23-20. Adam Vinatieri's 43 yard field goal, last play of the game. Although the Colts didn't know it, because they didn't show the score on the scoreboard. They had actually won it minutes earlier when the Jags lost. The Steelers win the AFC North. The Falcons win the NFC South.</p><p>And the NBA last night, in Los Angeles, before a rare booing crowd, they booed the Lakers at the Staples Center. The Lakers lost to the Grizzlies by 19 points, 104-85. And after the game, Phil Jackson blamed it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, early in the third quarter on some stupid plays, and, you know, Kobe has to screw up the, you know, game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one. That takes the rest of the guys out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Wow, Kobe screwing up the game.</p><p>IMUS: So Kobe was going one-on-one with some other member of the other team, obviously, duh, right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, one of the members of -- one of the audience members.</p><p>IMUS: Well, speaking of the audience, here's what's wrong with the Lakers.</p><p>WOLF: What is it?</p><p>IMUS: It's one thing if Jack Nicholson wants to have floor seats -- I mean, I think he deserves those. He's earned them, don't you think?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But not Larry David. Not some sit -- not some sitcom dope.</p><p>MCCORD: What's he done?</p><p>IMUS: Well, should be sitting there -- I mean you just can't.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, work it --</p><p>IMUS: And yet I watched the game on Christmas Day, the brain did -- of course I'm furiously e-mailing Breen my comments as he's trying to do the game, which I'm sure -- and he sometimes answers them, by the way.</p><p>WOLF: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: But Larry David? How possibly could Larry David -- who gave Larry David a floor seat? That's a disgrace.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He only created \"Seinfeld.\" Come on.</p><p>IMUS: What does \"Seinfeld\" have do with it. Seinfeld must have something to do with it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, a little bit. Larry David's a genius?</p><p>IMUS: Still shouldn't be sitting on -- he's a sitcom dope. He shouldn't be sitting on the floor.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get him out.</p><p>IMUS: He just don't. He may be a genius, but he shouldn't be sitting on the floor. This is the guy you were screaming about he peed on Jesus.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we all stray.</p><p>IMUS: He's -- he is a genius or you -- or he peed on Jesus. You can't pee on Jesus, can you?</p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: And be a genius.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The two are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>IMUS: It doesn't take a genius to pee on Jesus. It takes 12 -- well, it takes probably a drunk or, you know --</p><p>MCGUIRK: The fact that he got away with it, that was so offensive.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Anyway, 19 after the hour.</p><p>So, were you finished with sports, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: His third sack of the game.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Time for a little business news and here with that is Connell McShane.</p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Just a few quick headlines for you this morning. The market is up again after an 11 percent gain for the Dow in 2010. And the 17 percent rise for the Nasdaq in 2010. The futures are way up this morning. Maybe some optimism about economic data. We had plenty of it this week. Construction spending and manufacturing today. The big retail reports out for the month of December on Thursday and the jobs report for the month of December on Friday.</p><p>So that is there, plus the report, I-man, in \"The New York Times\" that we talked about earlier that Facebook has received an investment of $500 million from Goldman Sachs, according to \"The Times,\" which values Facebook at $50 billion.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. And then Dagen McDowell, who will be coming up in a few minutes. She and Connell do their very own show at 11:00 a.m. on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour. Here's one of Mary Matalin's five favorite songs.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: Well, let me tell you about Lindamood-Bell. You know what, the lady who runs Lindamood-Bell grew up on a cattle ranch. Old Nancy. Did you know that? I want to share with you the success story from the Lindamood-Bell learning processes. This is from a parent with an eight-year-old son diagnosed with autism. Here's the letter.</p><p>\"David was diagnosed with autism and struggled with socializing, expressive language, critical thinking, comprehension. David started with an assessment at Lindamood-Bell and did an eight week intensive program. The staff at Lindamood-Bell was sensitive to our concerns and needs and gave us constant feedback. David has improved tremendously. Before Lindamood-Bell, his overall comprehension was at the ninth percentile. After his retest at Lindamood-Bell, he was at the 70 percentile.\" That's unbelievable, isn't it? Call them at 800-300-1818 or go online at lindamoodbell.com.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Johnson &amp; Johnson, today, is going to announce a powerful new cancer test that it wants to put on the market. It's a blood test. It is billed as being able to spot a single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells. J&amp;J teaming up with scientists who invented the test to make it cheaper and better. And their hope is that the blood test can take the place of more invasive cancer tests.</p><p>Stocks starting off the new year with gains. The data out of China is being seen as a positive for the market. It showed manufacturing slip for the first time in five months, but what's that doing is it's easing some inflation concerns. And Europe has been up all morning long. London closed today because of the New Year's holiday. But Paris up 2 percent. Germany up 1.25 percent.</p><p>Here in the U.S., stock index futures indicating a higher open a little over an hour from now on Wall Street with the Dow futures up by 90 points. And a quick look at commodities as well. The oil price is around $92 a barrel all morning. And gold, after being lower, is now up over $1 at $1,422 per ounce.</p><p>All right. The IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right now here at the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Twenty-six after the hour as we continue to get behind here. But it's -- we're getting everything in, so that's more important than anything else, I guess. So, it's time for a little business news again. Here with that, Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>From getting behind to going up, gas prices. The national average for regular unleaded is already $3.07 a gallon. It's going to head back to near $4 a gallon by the spring according to many experts. It should be the second highest year on record in terms of prices. Let's hope it doesn't get back to $4.11 a gallon. That was a record hit in the summer of '08.</p><p>And, by the way, if you're interested in how Shania Twain's life develops with this new husband, who's the ex-husband of the woman who broke up Shania's marriage, she's going to have her own show on the new Oprah Winfrey Network later this year, I believe, called \"Why Not?\" with Shania Twain.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. So you can keep --</p><p>IMUS: Do you have a picture of the husband? Because she's cute.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's cute. Do we have a picture of their wedding?</p><p>IMUS: No, of him?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, well, of him.</p><p>IMUS: You were telling me how hot he was.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's got -- well, he's got curly -- he's got curly hair and it kind of has a little bit of a mullet if memory serves. He's pretty cute. He's better looking than Mutt Lange, I'll put it that way.</p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash deal on that, isn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, brother.</p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash trailer park situation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but you get to watch it for free, though, when you watch it on the TV. That's -- or you can come over to my house, which I don't think you want to do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. How did that go, by the way, over the holidays at your house?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was all right. I got trapped in the house with six adults, three kids and three dogs. And one of the dogs, being a four month old border collie puppy. So that was a good time.</p><p>IMUS: Who were the adults?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mama, daddy, brother, his wife, Jonas and me. If you could call us all adults.</p><p>IMUS: How is your brother's wife? How do you get along with her?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I adore her.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you do?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. We get along good.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, that's too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Well, we'd just like a little friction and stuff going on. So there wasn't any animosity that bubbled to the surface there or any long held resentments or anything?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I wasn't happy with -- no, I wasn't happy with my Christmas gifts from Jonas. But other than that.</p><p>IMUS: What did he get you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Underwear that he bought -- I know he bought on sale because I saw it on sale on the Internet. And a computer, a laptop, which is just business. I didn't want something business related. And I wanted underwear that fit that was nicer than what he gave me. So, I was mad. At least I didn't get those pajama jeans. I mean I can look on the bright side.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he didn't get you like them big ole granny drawers, did he?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some were, yes, large in size. Some, too small. There was no happy medium.</p><p>IMUS: He didn't' get --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was no happy medium. They were either to small and uncomfortable or they were too big and loose.</p><p>IMUS: So he didn't go the Victoria's Secret thong deal?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, he went on the Internet to one of these private sales sites and bought drawers on sale.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he got you some -- he got you some of those Hanes -- big old -- them Hanes big beefy drawers.</p><p>MCCORD: Off of eBay.</p><p>IMUS: All right, time for a Bernard McGuirk briefing, a \"Bernie Briefing,\" sponsored by -- these big old beefy drawers.</p><p>MCCORD: That ain't right.</p><p>IMUS: Sponsored by P.C. Richard &amp; Son. A hundred and one years they've got it going on. Still going on.</p><p>What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, chief, on the \"New Year's Rocking Eve\" fright night, the TV shows, I confess I was one of the losers who was up at midnight watching. And I was watching Dick Clark --</p><p>IMUS: No, don't do this.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And -- well, no, no, this is -- this is a big story. There are competing, differing opinions as to whether or not Dick Clark should still be out there. Some people say it's an inspiration, but --</p><p>IMUS: No, no. It's too humiliating for him. Whoever is around him shouldn't let him do this. It's terrible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DICK CLARK, BROADCASTER: But don't you go anywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Where did that come from?</p><p>IMUS: I didn't hear the sound. There's no point in playing it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We have audio here. Lou will play it.</p><p>Here, Lou. Go ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARK: Thank you, Ryan, very much. Now, take a look at all the people up on Broadway. I don't know how people pull off this party year after year, but they do a whale of a job. And tonight it will be bigger and better than ever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Again, some people say that's inspiring, and some people say it's out of place. But in any case, he won the night far and away. He was the most watched show that night of all the broadcast and cable New Year's Eve shows. And God bless poor old Dick Clark.</p><p>IMUS: You bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: What?</p><p>IMUS: You evil bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why?</p><p>IMUS: You just can't --</p><p>MCCORD: Well, he shouldn't be going on.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I didn't put him on ABC.</p><p>IMUS: No, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I think he should be on. I think he is an inspiration.</p><p>IMUS: Put him on Fox. No. No.</p><p>MCCORD: He was just presenting the controversy.</p><p>IMUS: You put him on ABC. You can't be. You can't do that. It's horrible.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I happen to disagree. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a nice thing. And again, it inspires people who have been ill.</p><p>My dad had a stroke, he came back from it. It makes people say, yes, I can do it.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. Here he is on -- who is that Ryan Seacrest? Do you have any sound on that, Big Foot.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We have a little -- we have sound. Lou and I have some sound from Ryan Seacrest just before --</p><p>IMUS: Well, there's Dick and -- Big Foot, we can't hear any sound on this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe he doesn't want to.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN SEACREST: Sorry. Sorry, not my fault.</p><p>CLARK: Happy New Year.</p><p>SEACREST: Happy New Year. Great job.</p><p>CLARK: Thank you, Ryan. Thank you.</p><p>SEACREST: Thank you so much.</p><p>Dick Clark, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>Well, we are inside, and it's even warmer in here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a nice thing. The man's been through hell and back. Way to kick off the new year.</p><p>Charles, push him. Is he all right?</p><p>MCCORD: He's all right, but he's --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Looking to the future.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: You son of a bitch!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Tom goes for the easy joke.</p><p>IMUS: Call that funny, Charles?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good. Now everybody is --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Everybody is waiting to see who is going to say it.</p><p>IMUS: Tom.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, Tom, have you got that clip? Lou?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll he come up here and I'll find you. Are you coming down here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just got to e-mail from Neil Cavuto.</p><p>IMUS: That's not funny.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was down at the ranch last we week.</p><p>MCCORD: This is not -- stop.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not funny. It's not funny, no.</p><p>MCCORD: This is not good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not funny, Bernard. It's not.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Look, God bless Dick Clark, is all I'm saying.</p><p>MCCORD: There is an is inspirational story.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. That Ryan Seacrest, too.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCCORD: You've got to stop.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God.</p><p>MCGUIRK: \"Blonde on Blonde\" is coming up tomorrow.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: That's just horrible. God.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Imus at night -- be there.</p><p>IMUS: Why do they do that? That's horrible.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are they wheeling him out there?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, it's his show. He's as lucid as they come. He just can't speak properly. So why not?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the way he's going to go out though.</p><p>MCGUIRK: So what? That's his choice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it's not.</p><p>IMUS: That's not right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It was a ratings winner for the night.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't think it had much to do --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go see how he is?</p><p>IMUS: Do you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Ryan Seacrest. You had a bunch of great performers. Kesha was there.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Ryan Seacrest, if you get down and you -- I mean, I like him, but if you get down and you scrape the bottom of the show biz barrel, that's where you find Ryan Seacrest. I mean, he's on the E! Channel, for God's sake.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's \"American Idol.\" He's at the top of his game, that guys.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, whatever. He's at the bottom of the barrel. He may be at the top of the game, but --</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: And when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California Congressman Darrell Issa getting a big promotion. He'll become the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which basically means he'll be the one or heading up the committee that oversees the government.</p><p>And appearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Issa telling Chris Wallace he's going to target government spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: We have about $1.7 trillion worth of regulatory costs already in the government. If the president wants to throw another $300 or $400 billion, what he's doing is taking it right out of businesses, right out of employment, right out of competitiveness. We need to make sure we can compete.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings as committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also Medicare.</p><p>Checking in on the markets here this morning for you, up all morning long. And we are indicated higher on the futures by 85 points now on Dow futures. It looks like a strong start to the new year coming on Wall Street in just a little while.</p><p>It's the IMUS IN THE MORNING program that continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>IMUS: Twenty minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country, and on the Fox Business Network all over the world. Three new radio affiliates today -- WAUB, 1590, way up there on the right-hand side of the dial where the dogs can listen, and at 94.1 FM here in Auburn, New York.</p><p>MCCORD: But you can't.</p><p>IMUS: On WGBA, 1240 on the dial there in Geneva, New York, Finger Lakes News Radio. And KWKC, 1340 AM, in Abilene, Texas, Talk Radio 1340.</p><p>Tomorrow, on this program, Tom Friedman. Wednesday, \"Blonde on Blonde.\"</p><p>Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, our old friend, former assistant to the president, vice president, a bunch of other stuff, Mary Matlin.</p><p>Good morning, Ms. Matalin.</p><p>MARY MATALIN, FMR. ASSISTANT TO VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY: Here, kitty kitty. Hey. Good morning. Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Are you calling the cat?</p><p>MATALIN: Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty kitty. She was trapped outside and was about to unleash the dogs of my hell, my mini dachshund. I said, \"Kitty.\"</p><p>It irritates I-Man. He doesn't want to hear you.</p><p>IMUS: I like cats and dogs. What's your cat's name?</p><p>MATALIN: Witchy. She has one green eye and one blue eye.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you out of breath?</p><p>MATALIN: Because I had to move the chair, open the shades, and open the window from the bottom up, while I was holding the phone in my ear. And I'm old now.</p><p>IMUS: Did you -- what did you do New Year's Eve?</p><p>MATALIN: Made black eyed peas and cabbage and listened to WWOZ and had a glass of wine by myself.</p><p>IMUS: Where was James?</p><p>MATALIN: Was it after 9:00? If it's after 9:00, he's in bed.</p><p>IMUS: So did you stay up and watch the ball come down?</p><p>MATALIN: I listened to WWOZ, which is the best jazz in the world -- Irvin Mayfield, jazz play club on Bourbon Street live.</p><p>IMUS: Radio?</p><p>MATALIN: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you didn't make that clear.</p><p>MATALIN: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I should know everybody doesn't know WWOZ. But if you don't, you can get it live streaming. It's the best jazz.</p><p>IMUS: Because Bernie just played a cut of Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve in which Mr. Clark was on. And, of course, he's had a stroke some years ago.</p><p>MATALIN: Yes, I saw it on, and I have to take Bernie's side as I do on most things on this. I thought it was an inspiration.</p><p>IMUS: You thought it was an inspiration?</p><p>MATALIN: I guess you don't.</p><p>IMUS: Well, an inspiration to who?</p><p>MATALIN: Just what Bernie said. If you've been -- if you've come back from something that -- a disease that people -- or suffered from something that would normally render you hidden away for whatever reason, and you can come back, that's an inspiration to others who are similarly afflicted. Heart disease or cancer or anything, you can talk about it and show people that everything is workable, and life is worth living.</p><p>IMUS: Does she have a point, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, and a point that it need not be in all cases the end and --</p><p>MATALIN: Or it can be a different reality.</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly. And Mr. Clark is a textbook example of that.</p><p>IMUS: Well, but my problem with it is --</p><p>MCCORD: What?</p><p>IMUS: -- is that whenever it gets played on this program, and the reason that it's intended to be a source of amusement, that's the problem.</p><p>MATALIN: So it's not -- so, as always, it's always about you. This is about what, is that you're saying? You didn't like it?</p><p>IMUS: Well, guess what? It's 2011. Suddenly, it's not going to be about me this year. Well, of course.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATALIN: This is your new New Year's resolution?</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but I don't know --</p><p>MCCORD: It could be about him a few years down the road.</p><p>IMUS: I just don't -- I don't know. I feel bad for the guy and I don't think it's funny. I mean, you can make it funny. They did make it funny, Bernie and Lou, of course, and Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: You made it funny.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MATALIN: You made it funny. Bernie made it about --</p><p>IMUS: Then they made it about me, a window to the future.</p><p>MATALIN: You invited it. You invited it by being so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I don't invite the ridicule that I constantly get on this program.</p><p>MATALIN: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p>MATALIN: OK.</p><p>IMUS: So the Bush tax cuts, I guess, have been extended. What does that mean?</p><p>MATALIN: That means these rich bastards who don't need them, you know, are now going to get them.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why do you think the president did it?</p><p>MATALIN: Because he's -- he just wanted to screw his own guys.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MATALIN: No. None of the above.</p><p>IMUS: Well what then?</p><p>MATALIN: It's -- I think we -- he did it because he didn't want to be blamed for not doing it. And Larry Summers and everybody else came out and said that reality, which will give us a double-dip recession if taxes are affected in a recession.</p><p>IMUS: So you think it's going to have an impact on the economy?</p><p>MATALIN: I think the opposite would have had a severe impact, a better impact --</p><p>IMUS: That's not what I asked you.</p><p>MATALIN: Well, these aren't yes or no questions.</p><p>IMUS: Well, answer it as best as you can, as you're capable of.</p><p>MATALIN: I'm answering it.</p><p>IMUS: By opening the window and choking your cat.</p><p>MATALIN: One of the cats, the one that still has a tail.</p><p>A better package would have been to have no spending increases and leave the tax structure as it was, and leave the estate tax where it was so people don't make decisions upon -- about their final days based on their tax situation, which I think is immoral. That would have been the better package, but that's not what happened because politics --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Well, the rap we were hearing, Mary Matalin, is that if we gave the tax cuts to all these rich bastards and these other folks, that that would all -- that they would then invest in the economy and hire more people and all that sort of thing.</p><p>So, my question is, do you think that's going to happen?</p><p>MATALIN: No, that's the rap that -- that's -- the case for tax cuts as a stimulative economic policy do not --</p><p>IMUS: I like that phrase.</p><p>MATALIN: -- go to those tax cuts. That was maintaining a tax rate, the changing of which would have exacerbated recessionary problems.</p><p>Stimulative taxes -- not all tax cuts are created equal -- would have been further reductions of the top rates, a reduction in the corporate tax rate, eradication of corporate taxes loopholes and such, and tax reform, which the president's talking about. That's stimulative tax policy, not just keeping the same rates. So that's one of their canards.</p><p>And what would be most stimulative now is to continue to reduce or make some effort to stop spending and roll back the debt, starting with health care. So that will be the plan, and I hope they get some of it done.</p><p>IMUS: And your scummy Republican friends were shamed into caving in on the 9/11 Responders Bill.</p><p>MATALIN: In response to scummy liberals, who --</p><p>IMUS: And inspired quite a bit by Shep Smith (ph).</p><p>MATALIN: -- let it sit there for years and did nothing about it, and wait until it's Christmas Eve and lard it up. Yes, it should have been passed. It should have been passed two years earlier. There shouldn't have been anybody who had any problem getting any health care at any time from 9/11 on.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, that's a very good point.</p><p>Hey, how are things in New Orleans? You live there now, right?</p><p>MATALIN: We're going on year three.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MATALIN: This is our third year here. It's wonderful.</p><p>IMUS: Who is the new mayor there?</p><p>MATALIN: He's spectacular.</p><p>IMUS: Who is it -- huh?</p><p>MATALIN: He's going to be up in New York. He comes a lot. He's got a new police chief.</p><p>IMUS: What is his name?</p><p>Oh, I'm sorry. Mitch Landrieu, Mayor Mitch.</p><p>IMUS: Has he been indicted yet?</p><p>MATALIN: We used to -- half the state was under water and other half was under indictment. But we're not like that now. We're all cleaned up now.</p><p>IMUS: Happy New Year to you, the kids, him.</p><p>MATALIN: And Happy New Year. You'll never be -- you'll always be you, Imus. You'll just always be you.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let's hope so. Thank you.</p><p>MATALIN: Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Mary Matalin.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.

I  went to the Jets game yesterday, they won, 38-7.  But you know that  already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS:  Yes, I don't care about the Jets game because they were already in  the playoffs.  So I don't care about the Seattle Seahawks and the Rams  people, but I'll find out apparently from Warner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCSHANE:  So one of them with - record made the playoffs.  I'm being told  in my ear, you want to know who won now or no?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS:  No, let me find out from Warner, because, Warner likes to tell me  stuff like that.</p><p>MCSHANE:  It is Warner's job.</p><p>IMUS:  Santa brought us a goofy tie?  Is that what happened? </p><p>MCSHANE:  No, I had that one already, I-man.</p><p>IMUS:  The funny tie, under the tree.</p><p>MCSHANE:  So you got two weeks off and that is the best you could come up  with.</p><p>IMUS:  That's all I could come up with.</p><p>MCSHANE:  You sound great, by the way.  How this is voice, good?</p><p>IMUS:  Well, I don't have throat cancer, they tell me, but I do have --  pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Really? </p><p>IMUS:  Yes --and, like if you had a colonoscopy and they find this --  remove them, so, these are -- they have to take them off with a laser here  in a couple of weeks, and this is way too much information.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I actually care.  I told you, I care.</p><p>IMUS:  I'll be fine.</p><p>MCSHANE:  You will be OK, that is the main point.</p><p>IMUS:  Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, and Mary Matalin coming up this morning.   Three new radio affiliates - have you even seen that guy who does the red  eye thing here on Fox.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Is he any good.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, sure.   It's fine.  I don't watch it.  It is on in the  middle of the night, but a lot of people like it.</p><p>IMUS:  I saw him on the news with Megyn Kelly and -- too happy to suit me,  but he seemed funny.</p><p>MCSHANE:  He is pretty funny.</p><p>IMUS:  I wonder if we should have him on.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Sure, why not.  Give it a try.</p><p>IMUS:  Is he any good?  He is good.  You are saying that because we're on - - on TV, here, aren't you.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That is why, yes.</p><p>IMUS:  What is going on with business -- how this is Facebook deal, Goldman  Sachs.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, $50 billion valuation on Facebook.  It's no joke right  there.</p><p>IMUS:  Please.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's what Goldman thinks it's worth anyway.  I will get to that  in a second, but thank you, I-man and good morning.  First, let's bring up  the markets and look up some numbers here because stocks are starting off  the new week and the New Year with some gains here globally.</p><p>China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and  if anything that's actually easing concerns about inflation and the Chinese  market at the bottom screen is up 1-3/4 percent overnight.</p><p>Markets in Hong Kong and South Korea are also up, and Japan has not  resumed trading yet in the New Year.  Over in Europe, London is closed  today for the New Year's holiday, but Paris and Frankfurt are both up  significantly, Paris by more than 2 percent and our futures indicating a  higher open on Wall Street as well up by 76 points on Dow futures, pretty  good numbers.</p><p>Now as for the major indexes and how they fared in 2010, the Dow gained 11  percent, S&amp;P 13 percent, the Nasdaq the best performer of the bunch, 17  percent gain.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on more  debt national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion ceiling and the  White House Council of Economic Advisors, Chairman Austin Goolsbee on ABC's  \"This Week\" saying it's crucial the ceiling is raised.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUSTIN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS:  This is not a  game, you know, the debt ceiling is not something to toy with.  That is the  -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that is the -- essentially defaulting on our  obligations, which is unprecedented in American history. The impact on the  economy would be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Many Republicans agree it does need to be raised but, many of  them are also saying they will not go along with it unless they get  promises to change Washington's spending habits and argue there is no point  in having a debt ceiling if they raise it every time the national debt gets  close.  Now here's the story that the I-man was referring to a moment ago.</p><p>Goldman Sachs investing $450 million in Facebook, according to the \"New  York Times.\"  A Russian company also buying $50 million worth of Facebook's  stock.  \"The Times\" says these deals value Facebook at $50 billion.  Now,  as we have reported the FCC now looking into secondary market trading at  Facebook's privately held shares.</p><p>Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its web site, the latest  development in the conflict between airlines and online travel agencies,  since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says Expedia intentionally  listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.  American is  looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own web site and every  effort to save money.  Expedia says the move will only cost them ticket  sales and believes Americans' efforts are bad for travellers.</p><p>All right, let's take a live look now at commodities this morning.  The  oil price is above $92 per barrel and gold is down by a dollar per ounce.</p><p>Coming up, a little bit later on in the hour, Bo Dietl will be the I-man's  guest as IMUS IN THE MORNING does get started, right now, Fox Business,  power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS:  Warner, who won the football game last night?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER:  Seahawks, man, they finished 7-9.  Win the  division and are in the playoffs.</p><p>IMUS:  So the giants, who are 10-6, they are not in the playoffs.</p><p>WOLF:  You got it.  No, you have to change the rule.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN:  That is crazy.</p><p>WOLF:  Absurd, yes.</p><p>IMUS:  I will whip somebody's butt over there -- Charles and I.</p><p>WOLF:  Now you're talking.</p><p>IMUS:  Charles and me, yes.  And, I get my grammar screwed up.  Happy New  Year, everybody.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  Shucks.</p><p>IMUS:  Bring you up on my medical, last time --</p><p>MCCORD:  Let's have the latest.</p><p>IMUS:  I'm had a biopsy -- let me say this about Mt. Sinai.  It is a great  hospital.  You know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and Cornell and Mt. Sinai  is a great hospital.  The nurses are unbelievable and Dr. Peekaboo Woo, and  Dr. Allen Reid, the anesthesiologist, are fabulous.</p><p>MCCORD:  Good.</p><p>IMUS:  They all did a great job and I apparently do not have throat cancer.   What I have are these pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCCORD:  Dysplasia, yes. </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Charles knows more about what I have than I do.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes. </p><p>IMUS:  So, they have to remove them with a laser, and, at a high level, and  they would develop into -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Get rid of them, that is why we get rid of them.</p><p>IMUS:  And you know how I got them?  Smoking.</p><p>MCCORD:  Really?  That is what they say?  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  I haven't smoked for 15 years, but - </p><p>MCCORD:  Listen to that, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>IMUS:  Anyway, so I'm fine, Bo Dietl, Jerry Greenfield.</p><p>MCCORD:  That's great news to start the new year.</p><p>IMUS:  Bo Dietl, still have prostate cancer but, I think I do.  I'm not  sure anymore whether I do or not.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes, may have defeated that.</p><p>IMUS:  And, I came back from the ranch on Saturday.</p><p>MCCORDs:  That's 700 miles an hour with the freaking tail wind.</p><p>IMUS:  What a great vacation.  It's 10 degrees.  We have to go out there,  because we run the place.  It's 10 degrees -- the wind - there's not a ski  resort.</p><p>MCCORD:  How about that wind?</p><p>IMUS:  The wind blows and I'm not exaggerating, 60 miles an hour.  Anyway,  Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, Mary Matalin, coming up and we have three new  radio affiliates, and when I put my glasses on I'll tell you who they are.</p><p>I'm not going to do it now and, ratings came out in New York and for  people -- the ratings are broken down, all kinds of demographics and I  don't believe in them but I think they give you a rough idea, of you know - - I mean, you can -- like lit-fm or one of those -- hot 97 or one of these.   Whoever these stations are, that do well.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes. </p><p>IMUS:  And if it is consistent over a long period of time, like when stern  was on terrestrial radio, you knew he was number one, and had been on a  long time, a trend that remains supported, consistency.</p><p>IMUS:  So, but on these 12-plus numbers they measure people by demographics  like break it down to 12 to 18, 25-54, 18-34, it is ridiculous.  Men,  women, all of this and there's another one they do and it is just everybody  who is 12 years of age or older. And, this program, the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program, is the number 2 program in New York.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Get out of town!</p><p>MCCORD:  Shut the front door!</p><p>IMUS:  Now, of course, I told Connell and Dagen that part of that, because,  they are about the only new thing we have done here, other than I have a  better attitude.  They were partly responsible for that and then I got to  thinking about it and if it weren't for them, we could have easily been  number one.</p><p>MCCORD:  Number one.  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I'm sorry, I-man.</p><p>IMUS:  Which is the reason, when I got fired, and got the job at ABC I  insisted on bringing Lou and Bernie, and Charles and everybody else,  because, I knew without them, I would just be -- if it weren't for them, I  would be on some station, in Jersey with Uncle Floyd.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER:  Uncle Floyd!</p><p>IMUS:  I'd be on Sirius satellite radio.  Mel likes me, to give me a job  for 50 grand a year.  And sit there - </p><p>RUFINO:  At UHF -- </p><p>IMUS:  The I-man's blues channel, Blues and alternate country on Sirius.   But, as it is -- so the show -- I've never been number 2, ever.  Not back  when --</p><p>MCCORD:  Your best ratings.</p><p>IMUS:  Not back when I was.  So I'm happy about that and it is a great  program.  It's a better program than it ever was.  Having very little to do  -- not being self-effacing, having we little to do with me, Bernie, Lou,  they are all great.  Time for a little news and here with that is Chuck  McCord.  Good morning, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD:  Good morning, I-man.  Speaking of the weather, the main highway  between southern and central California, shut down, both directions,  blowing snow and ice from another big storm.  The grapevine area of I-5  closed indefinitely, winds gusting to -- reminded me, winds, gusting to 90  miles per hour in mountain areas, and still accumulating at elevations, as  low as just 1,500 feet.</p><p>President Obama, says he is honored to sign the bill to provide aid to  survivors of the 9/11 attacks, and first responders, all of whom --</p><p>IMUS:  You know -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  \"The New York Times\" did an article about the stuff that Jon  Stewart, who as you know, I like, stuff Jon Stewart did about the 9/11  bill.</p><p>MCCORD:  I saw it and all of that.</p><p>IMUS:  And wondering if Jon Stewart was under Edward R. Murrow, which I  would hope even Jon Stewart would be embarrassed about.  But perhaps he's  not or we don't know because I don't know him, but I would suggest -- and  it has nothing do with anything, but until Shep Smith went on the rant that  he went on, as a result of seeing Jon Stewart's show, which Shep said he  did, and -- hey, big foot -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS:  There's the famous rap that Shep Smith did, he was talking to  somebody, and he referenced Jon Stewart, and he had seen the Jon Stewart  show apparently the night before, there's got to be a way to find that,  right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, we'll find it.</p><p>IMUS:  He was -- first of all, they are both terrific, both Stewart and  Shep Smith is magnificent.  Few better, in fact -- I don't know if there is  anybody better, but it was a respond -- did you site, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.  I did --</p><p>IMUS:  Am I right?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  On the money, a 100 percent.</p><p>IMUS:  He was absolutely spectacular.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  I happened to see that.</p><p>IMUS:  And it seemed to me it was spontaneous.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Certainly seemed that way.</p><p>IMUS:  And the boy seemed to be articulate to me and I have to play it for  you.  So I think that if you are a bunch of Republicans, I -- remember I  had John Thune on and he was giving me some nonsense about -- didn't wanted  to rush into it.</p><p>I didn't press him hard on that, not as much as I should have, and, you  know, the -- I started to say to him, you know, don't want to rush into  anything and, I hope we get it before all of these people die.  So, people  like Senator Thune, who I am no longer supporting for anything -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That may be premature. The Republicans -- they ended up saving $3  billion from that particular bill. That is what they were holding out for,  eliminate --</p><p>IMUS:  They weren't going to do it until they got shamed into it by Jon  Stewart and by Shep Smith, I'm saying.  And when Shep Smith attacked them,  I'm sure they were thinking, that is our home boy there, at Fox.</p><p>I mean, I'm sure in their minds they are thinking if we lost Shep Smith we  lost the country.  You would expect Jon Stewart.  I thought it was  magnificent what he did, by the way, but you expect him to do what he did  but you wouldn't expect Shep Smith to do what he did and if you lose him  you lost everybody.  I mean, I'm sure they are thinking that and go that  the scared into passing it, didn't they, Bernie, talking about the money  they saved, because you carry water for them.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  That's the fact.  Chuck Schumer's bill was $7 billion and, the  bill ended up being $4 billion and they saved --</p><p>IMUS:  But they wouldn't have done anything, had there not been those two  events, am I right.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Perhaps, there's no way to conclusively prove that, but it sure  seems that way.</p><p>IMUS:  And let me ask you this, for everybody who thinks, Sarah Palin is a  moron, and I would be one of them, would you would this country be any  worse off today if she were president?  Answer me that.  Tell me.  I'm  waiting --</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Checkmate for the I-man.</p><p>MCCORD:  There you go.</p><p>IMUS:  Because, at least -- think whatever you want to think about her, and  think as I do, maybe, even.  I don't know that I think she is a moron but  she'd have sense enough to at least ask the people rather than get the same  people bush had.  But, this dope has been doing -- I mean, is he still on  vacation in Hawaii, by the way?</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.  He comes back I think late today.</p><p>IMUS:  And then, on I-25, out there in Santa Fe, when you go up to the  ranch into Santa Fe, before you get into Santa Fe, there was a guy has a  houses -- a lot of people have houses, a guy has a house, puts up these  goofy billboards, a homemade billboard. </p><p>And, makes me laugh every time, they change and he's obviously a Hannity  devotee or one of them and once he has had up there for a while.  Where is  the birth certificate?  The hand lettered dopey sign, where is the birth  certificate.  Here's my question -- where is it?  I mean, I'm not a --  obviously I'm not one of those --</p><p>MCGUIRK:  A birther?</p><p>IMUS:  Of course not.  But, where is it?</p><p>MCCORD:  I don't know.</p><p>IMUS:  Isn't the governor of ha walkers wasn't he screaming all about it?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  He's claiming --</p><p>IMUS:  Where is it?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, let's see it.  Clear this up.</p><p>IMUS:  I mean, if the guy who is supporting the president -- which I would  tend to support him, too, by the way.  But I just say.</p><p>MCCORD:  Let's resolve this.</p><p>IMUS:  Why haven't we ever seen it or why don't they produce it, I can't  answer that.</p><p>IMUS:  It just adds fuel to these nuts.</p><p>MCCORD:  Of course it does.</p><p>IMUS:  Anyway, 16 after the hour, taking way too much time with my  nonsense, did you do any news at all?  I interrupted you, 9/11 bill.</p><p>MCCORD:  The James Zadroga bill has been signed by the president there in  Hawaii, yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Carly?  Anymore coffee?  She left -- </p><p>MCCORD:  I'll go get you some.</p><p>IMUS:  She said what did Wyatt get for Christmas and I couldn't remember,  horse stuff.  She said, well does she still believe in Santa Claus? </p><p>MCCORD:  And your reply.</p><p>IMUS:  I said, well, I still believe in Santa Claus.  Why wouldn't he?  You  know, 17 after the hour, Warner will do a little sports and before that, a  quick business update, from Connell McShane here on the Fox Business  Network and on the radio as well.  Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Good morning, I-man.  I'm talking about the markets here, as we  start off the new trading year to the up side, after a pretty good year in  2010, stocks are up, globally, this morning.</p><p>News out of China that show the economy there slowing down a little bit,  seen as a good sign because it eases concerns about inflation.  Anyway, the  futures are up.  The European markets that are open are all up and the  Asian markets were up, overnight as well.</p><p>Now, as for the year in 2010, the Dow ended the year, with a gain of 11  percent, the S&amp;P was up 13 percent, and the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch,  with a rise of nearly 17 percent, in 2010.</p><p>IMUS:  Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning and Dagen  McDowell will be along -- you guys still have your show 11:00 a.m.</p><p>MCSHANE:  So far, I believe, yes. </p><p>IMUS:  OK, we'll start the year, brand new year with their show and they'll  still do that and, that's good.  Three new radio affiliates, WAUB at 1590  and 98.1 FM, out there in Auburn, New York and WGVA, at 1240, in Geneva,  New York.  Finger Lakes news radio, they call that.</p><p>And, KWKC, 1340, on the AM dial, down there in Abiline, Texas, talk radio  1340 and they joined the IMUS In The Morning line-up of stations around the  country beginning this morning.  Time for a little sports now and here with  that is Warner Wolf.  Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF:  Good morning, I-man, well, completing the NFL picture, the playoffs  last night, Seattle wins the NFC West with a record of 7-9.  Come on! </p><p>IMUS:  Who do they play, New Orleans?</p><p>WOLF:  They'll play the Saints, yes, on Saturday.  You have to change the  rule here very quickly.  You know, forget winning the division, if you have  a losing record you are not in the playoffs.  You take the team with the  next best record, which would have been the Giants or the Bucks at 10-6.</p><p>Earlier, the Packers beat the Bears, 10-3.  The Packers, 10-6, win the  final wildcard.  AFC, the Colts win the AFC South, on the 43 yard field  goal, last play of the game, although the Colts had won it minutes earlier  when the Jags were eliminated.  Steelers, win the AFC.  North Falcons win  the NFC South so the playoffs are all set.</p><p>Packers, Eagles, in Philadelphia and Saints and Seahawks in Seattle, Jets  and Colts in Indianapolis and the Ravens and Chiefs in Kansas City, yes,  did you watch any of the bowl games?</p><p>WOLF:  None.</p><p>IMUS:  You know, I've watched them all, except I didn't pay any attention  to them because they don't mean anything.</p><p>WOLF:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  Including the one -- a week from tonight, Auburn and Oregon, you  make me watch that.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I'll watch that.</p><p>IMUS:  I won't be watching it. So, you'll watch that?</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I will.</p><p>IMUS:  Why wouldn't you be at Imus on Broadway, wouldn't you want to see  that?</p><p>WOLF:  A conflicting time.</p><p>IMUS:  It is that night.  It's already  sold out, so, I mean -- I could try  to get you in, but -- you don't express any interest, and every day you can  go to some stupid movie and routinely get a half a chicken sandwich or  tuna, whatever the hell you eat, a bottle of wine and go to the gym and,  see a stupid movie, park in the handicapped zone and then, go to some  idiot's Broadway musical or play of some sort and yet you won't come see  Imus on Broadway.  That is Monday night.  You will watch the stupid game  between Auburn and Oregon? </p><p>WOLF:  No, forget that bowl game!</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Too late.</p><p>IMUS:  They got to get a playoff.  They have playoffs, I mean, just stupid  they don't have that.  Don't you agree, Warner?</p><p>WOLF:  Absolutely, every baseball, basketball, college, hockey and --  everything, all have playoffs, except football.</p><p>IMUS:  Speaking of Imus on Broadway, Colin Quinn, who stars in long story  short, which I saw which is genius stuff, directed by Jerry Seinfeld, Colin  now joined the line-up of Broadway musical shows that will perform Monday  night at the Hard Rock.</p><p>MCCORD:  Great.</p><p>IMUS:  For the Imus cattle ranch for kids with cancer.  And, the legendary  emcee, which I exchanged e-mails throughout the past two weeks with, Dick  Cavett is our emcee and that is worth going to see, to see him.</p><p>And I'll be there, just to introduce him.  I wanted to thank our title  sponsor, GMC and, one place you can go to look great, feel good and feel  great and a GMC sales associate will show you the latest and greatest  health and fitness products.  Imus on Broadway, brought do you by GMC,  which we're going to tape that -- probably -- are we going to tape it, big  foot, or not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We'll tape it if you want.</p><p>IMUS:  I don't know, I don't know, if you can or not.  Anyway, Warner Wolf  sports, sponsored by American-made Peerless Boilers and the new 96 percent  efficient purifier series.  You have any more sports, Warner?</p><p>WOLF:  There's one more thing, listen to this, I-man the Grizzlies beat the  slumping Lakers last night, in L.A., by 19 points.  And after the game,  Phil Jackson really took it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH:  As a result, you know, behind  early in the third quarter, on -- stupid plays, and, Kobe has to screw up,  you know, the game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one, and  takes the rest of the guys out --</p><p>WOLF:  Wow.  Kobe's screwing up the game.  Phil Jackson.  That is pretty  harsh.</p><p>IMUS:  You know who I have become a fan of now? </p><p>WOLF:  Kevin Durant?</p><p>IMUS:  No.  The Miami Heat.  I'll tell you why --</p><p>WOLF:  Why, I-man?</p><p>RUFINO:  Can't wait for this.</p><p>IMUS:  Shut up, Lou!  I'll tell you why.</p><p>WOLF:  I wonder why.</p><p>RUFINO:  Miami heat, good God! </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Courageous.</p><p>WOLF:  It has nothing to do with the fact they've won 17 out of the last 18  and 11 in a row.</p><p>IMUS:  No.  No.  Because, something Magic Johnson said.  He said, LeBron  James is playing out of his mind, and he said it is time to stop booing  him.  He may -- you may be unhappy that he left Cleveland and the way he  went about it but, you have to get over that. The guy is a great basketball  player.  So, they have got that together.</p><p>MCCORD:  This is why?</p><p>IMUS:  What's wrong?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Why didn't he go to a team that didn't have a bunch of star  players and elevate them as most great players do?</p><p>IMUS:  Because that wasn't our plan.  It's 24 after the hour.  All right,  Steven Stills is 66 years old today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS:  Looking for an investment opportunity but not sure where to start?   Check out Planet Fitness's -- what \"Inc. Magazine\" calls one of the fastest  growing companies in America.  Miami heat, God.</p><p>MCCORD:  Pathetic.</p><p>IMUS:  You shut up!

His five favorite songs, the Allman  Brothers, \"One Way Out,\" \"Jungleland,\" Bruce Springsteen, \"Give me  Shelter,\" The Stones,  \"While my Guitar Gently Weeps,\" the Beatles, and,  \"Landslide,\" Fleetwood Mac, not a horrible list.   </p><p>MCCORD:  Peta.  </p><p>IMUS:  Huh?</p><p>RUFINO:  Peta Griffin.</p><p>MCCORD:  Peta.   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD:  This song sucks.</p><p>IMUS:  Time for little business news and here with all that, on the FOX  Business Network and on the radio as well is Dagen McDowell.  Good morning,  Dagen.   </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, sir.   </p><p>IMUS:  How are you?   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm good, welcome back, good to see you, sound great, look even  better.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All righty.  So, iPhone, the Apple in its iPhone seemed to fall  down on the job during the first two days of 2011 when the alarms that some  iPhone owners set failed to go off, leaving folks to oversleep, apparently,  it was one time alarm settings, not the recurrent ones saying, Apple will  not say what went wrong with it but, apparently it will be fixed from here  on out.  I gave my mama an iPad for Christmas.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, you did?   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, and, she opened it up and it was sealed, bought it at the  Apples store at Danbury Mall, it was sealed she opened it and it said Happy  Holidays, Dennis Piper and Alan Rosenthal (ph).  It was engraved by two  Endodontists that worked in Norwalk, that was my mama's Christmas gift from  us.  She kept it though.  </p><p>IMUS:  I don't quite understand you.  Did you Charles?  </p><p>MCCORD:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The iPad was engraved by these two Endodontists who apparently  given them to their staff or costumers and somebody returned it to the  Apple store and exchange it.  But Apple.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, they sold to you for.</p><p>MCDOWELL: .and they sold it to me at no discounted, I might add.  </p><p>IMUS:  What was the story then, the Apple store?   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, Apple store, so, mama got a kick out of it.  I thought it  was appropriate, you know, Christmas gift, root canals, you know, spending  time with your family, all kinds of seems, dove tell together.   </p><p>IMUS:  I thought she would have been offended that it didn't say Merry  Christmas.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, no.  She was probably offended by the fact we got her the  cheaper one, see the Wi-Fi, we got her the one with where you can -- the  AT&amp;T.   </p><p>IMUS:  That's the one you got to have, so.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Well, we chintz out on that, Merry Christmas, mama, that's  it.   </p><p>IMUS:  Why wouldn't you take it back?   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Too lazy, too much trouble.  </p><p>IMUS:  For your mama?   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  She seems happy with it.  She's fine.  And, I only have  to see her like twice a year, what she'll going to do about it?   </p><p>IMUS:  She's crying inside.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>IMUS:  She has to seem happy, so, she's happy that this marriage of yours  is working out apparently, so far.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's not happy I'm not living at home with three kids, single.   </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, and surprised.  Thirty three minutes after the hour, time for a  Bernie briefing sponsored by PC Richard and Son.  And here with all of that  is Bernard McGuirk.  Good morning, Bernie.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Good morning, chief.  Well, like most of us during the break, we  were either skiing in Switzerland or down in St. Barts, you know, lounging  off of P. Diddy's yacht or something.  So, we weren't paying attention to a  lot of things.  But over the break, President Obama apparently made a phone  call as the I-man not doubt heard about to the owner of the Philadelphia  Eagles, and during the course of a conversation about something else, he  mentioned to them that he was very happy that the owner signed their  quarterback Michael Vick, who has been just tearing it up on the field, at  least he was until a couple of days after this news came out.  And he told  him that he was glad, because a lot of ex-cons in society don't get a  second chance, he was very happy for the success of Michael Vick and the  fact that the guy gave him the opportunity and of course a lot of people  really just can't believe that he made that kind of phony waded into this  controversy unnecessarily.  </p><p>IMUS:  Plus he has a dog, doesn't he?   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.    </p><p>IMUS:  Don't they have a dog?  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  He's going to need a secret service himself now to protect him  from the president.   </p><p>IMUS:  Michael Vick comes to the White House, well, that is unfair, that's  not right.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  But yes, he does.  And, of course, again as I said, that  following Sunday, Vick played a terrible game.  Not that the two had any  connection.  </p><p>IMUS:  I don't see anything wrong with that.  You don't think the  president should have weighed in on it?   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No, not at all.  I think it's unnecessary again, it's just like  the Beer Summit with the cop versus the Harvard professor.  You just going  to alienate a bunch of people, there's no reason that people now is going  to take side, they'll going to hate -- if they needed a reason to hate  President Obama, this will give it to them, a lot of dog lovers, even  though I agree, the guy deserves a second chance.   </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  I don't know.  That is working pretty hard trying to find  something to wolf on Obama about.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, I agree he deserves a second chance but the president  should not. </p><p>IMUS:  The president deserves a second chance, I'm going to give it to him  now.  You know, I shouldn't say this.  But I actually feel like now, here  in New York, we have a governor.  I love David Paterson, that's sort of, I  guess maybe that is not right.  That's not right.  Bo Dietl is coming up,  we're going to talk to him.  Actually, Santa brought you an extra ten  pounds, huh?   </p><p>RUFINO:  Oh!   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  Thanks, Bernie.  Bo Dietl is next.  It's one of Peter Rodriguez's  five favorite songs, Beatles.   </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCCORD:  You think it, he says it.  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, time now for a business  update, from the FOX Business Network, here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  Your latest news update, starts with, this story  about Facebook in the \"New York Times\" this morning, the report is Goldman  Sachs is investing $450 million in Facebook, a Russian Company reportedly  also buying $50 million worth of Facebook stock.  Now, \"The Times\" is  saying this deals value Facebook at $50 billion.  As we reported, the SEC  is looking into the secondary market trading of Facebook's privately held  shares.  </p><p>And Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its Web site, the latest  development of the conflict between airlines and on-line travel agencies  since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says, Expedia  intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.   American is looking to push the consumers to buy tickets on its own Web  Site, in an effort to save money.  As -- there's a look at some of your top  stories, more news coming up as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues, right now,  with the check on the forecast.  </p><p>SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan  from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast.  You can see, we do  still have rain showers here in the southwest, and snow showers in the  higher elevations.  Most of the U.S. is looking very clear, and as we look  to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain  showers in New England along the coastline.  The midsection, lots of  sunshine, a slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis and as we look at  the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to  see many if any delays travel wise, because of the weather.  Other than  possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to the rain/snow mix.   I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program, on the FOX Business  Network.     </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Eighteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Jeff Greenfield, CBS News, Mary Matalin, down in New Orleans,  probably somewhere, they're both coming up, this portion of the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program is sponsored by State Bank, real people, real solutions,  statebankli.com.  Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, for  his regular visit, our old friend Bo Dietl, good morning, Mr. Dietl.   </p><p>BO DIETL, FOUNDER, BEAU DIETL AND ASSOCIATES:  Good morning and Happy New  Year to you and your family, everybody of the Imus family, Happy New Year  and it is a New Year and let's look forward to prosperity.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.   </p><p>DIETL:  OK.    </p><p>IMUS:  So, you don't bet on football games anymore?   </p><p>DIETL:  I have not bet one -- or one football game.  I don't have the money  anymore where I used to come in.  I used to roll in, it doesn't roll any  more.  I got four iPads because you showed me this, thank God for credit  cards, I got this 64 gigabyte with the Wi-Fi for my four children there.   And they all got one and, you know what, we lost a great guy last year,  George Steinbrenner.  Now, I can tell the story.  George Steinbrenner did  for me like nobody else did for me.  My daughter, Dana, who is the -- as a  senior at the University of Tampa, at first when she tried to apply there,  they only accepting a thousand students and her average was about 3.2, they  told her, you have to go to another college and matriculate, she starts  crying, dad, I wanted to go there, I wanted to go, I called Brandy Levine  and asked Mr. Steinbrenner if he could maybe possibly help her get in.  Mr.  Steinbrenner got back to me and says, help her get in.  Two days later, he  was accepted into the University in Tampa.  She now has a 4.0, she's on the  Dean's list, honors society and she might become the valedictorian for the  University of Tampa, my daughter Dana, I'm very proud.</p><p>IMUS:  Pretty good, huh?</p><p>DIETL:  And George Steinbrenner did it and my love out for the Steinbrenner  family, a lot of people don't realize what he does.  I sent him.   </p><p>IMUS:  Why did she want to go there?   </p><p>DIETL:  No.  She's graduating.   </p><p>IMUS:  No, no, why did she want to go there?   </p><p>DIETL:  I don't know.  It became like a kind of these kids get into a fad  like all the friends are going.  And then they all want to go -- at the  high school, they all want to go.  It is a very good school, she's doing  teaching of disabled, you know, speech therapy, that kind of stuff, to  teach people how to speak, she probably have to. </p><p>IMUS:  Should have started with you?  </p><p>DIETL:  Yes, I know.  I knew you were going to say that.   </p><p>MCCORD:  Is she adopted?  </p><p>DIETL:  Take it easy.  No, she looks just like me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>She looks like just me, but.  </p><p>IMUS:  Your daughter looks like you?   </p><p>DIETL:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, you know what?  Put it this way, they look  like a very good-looking version of a fat old man like me.   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, you are not an unattractive man but...   </p><p>DIETL:  Yes, so...   </p><p>IMUS:  Not as much an extra ten pounds but...   </p><p>DIETL:  All right.  Well, you want to know something?  I eat.  I don't eat  lamb's regurgitations and all that stuff like you do.  Now, over the  holidays.   </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, you don't have cancer like I do.   </p><p>DIETL:  John Mariotti, it's called \"The Chinese Conspiracy,\" this book is  for you.   </p><p>IMUS:  No, don't give to it me.  I won't read it.  </p><p>DIETL:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  I don't want it.   </p><p>DIETL:  OK.  Well, can I talk about it?  Because it's a great novel.   </p><p>IMUS:  Talk about what you want.   </p><p>DIETL:  OK.  \"The Chinese Conspiracy\" by John Mariotti is a new novel that  is out but the novel is based on a lot of facts.  We know what happened  with the Pentagon, with the breaking into the Supernet computers and all of  that kind of stuff, the Chinese.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>DIETL:  But this talks about a group of young Chinese guys that wanted to  overthrow the old Ancient guard of China.  So, what they do is they  infiltrate all of our systems, all of our technologies systems, our grid  and everything, and they shut down, they shut down the American -- all the  IT., all the planes.   </p><p>IMUS:  What happens?</p><p>DIETL:  What?</p><p>IMUS:  How does this happen that somebody gets this -- do you know this  guy?   </p><p>DIETL:  I don't know this guy but I'm going to tell you something.  I can,  I find a book, because. </p><p>IMUS:  You can't. </p><p>DIETL:  One of your yak-swallowing friends over there, one of your liberal  friends, they come over here. </p><p>IMUS:  Yak-swallowing friends. </p><p>DIETL:  But this guys from \"Newsweek,\" news day, all of the liberal pieces  of garbage, they give you something that is OK, this is a great novel  because based it's based on fact, \"The Chinese Conspiracy,\" it's about  reality, if Greenfield is sitting there, like this, blah, blah, then it  would be good.  Why can't I have a little, a little show time here?  You  have all these other guys, these guys that ran away from you, I stand by  you!  I'm loyal!  So, listen to me, once in a while!   </p><p>IMUS:  All I asked you...   </p><p>DIETL:  Great book.</p><p>IMUS:  By the way, when I got fired, you were going on all of those shows  running your fat mouth.  I had to -- I had to tell you to shut up, you were  talking too much.   </p><p>DIETL:  I went on with that.</p><p>IMUS:  I had to get you to shut up!  You were going around quoting me,  saying stuff that I never said.  I didn't want you to stick up for me, I  didn't need to be stuck up for.  I didn't want people going around and  making any excuses for me.  There wasn't any excuse, there is no excuse  now.  Your mic has been off for five minutes -- a minute.   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DIETL:  You sit on the board of the directors, you shouldn't be talking  about. </p><p>IMUS:  Hang on a minute.  Hang on a minute.</p><p>DIETL:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  All I wondered was, I'm sure the book is fine.  </p><p>DIETL:  It is great book because...   </p><p>IMUS:  Fine.   </p><p>DIETL: .it is based on fact.   </p><p>IMUS:  OK.    </p><p>MCCORD:  He just had a simple question.</p><p>IMUS:  I just wonder how you happened -- it happened to come to your  attention.  Who gave it to you, some friend of yours?   </p><p>DIETL:  He's a friend of Admiral Straw.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>DIETL:  And I was at the Army-Navy game and he has a hat like you wear.   </p><p>IMUS:  That's not a hat like I wear.   </p><p>DIETL:  Well, it looks like some. </p><p>IMUS:  No, it's not.   </p><p>DIETL:  All right.  OK.  And he signed you the book, I'm going to tell you  about something, you talk about novel. </p><p>IMUS:  He signed the book to me because he wants me to plug the book.  </p><p>DIETL:  No, you don't have to.</p><p>IMUS:  Which I'm not now going to do, because I'm so offended that you  attacked me.   </p><p>DIETL:  I challenged you to read this Don, because it is based on the facts  about them taking over.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  I'm sure it's fine.</p><p>DIETL:  Taking over our country, stopping all our airlines, all our  aviation, all our grid, all of that.  And we talk about it all of the time.  </p><p>IMUS:  And your iPads all work...  </p><p>DIETL:  No.  No.  No.  I got the ones that Wi-Fi.  Do you got a Wi-Fi?  Can  you go on the train and catch a Wi-Fi in 3G?   </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.    </p><p>DIETL:  No, you can't.  That is 64 gigahertz.</p><p>IMUS:  Of course, why would I buy something else?   </p><p>DIETL:  Because they didn't have the 64.   </p><p>IMUS:  Of course they did.   </p><p>DIETL:  That was only 37.  </p><p>IMUS:  This is Wi-Fi, also AT&amp;T.

Coming up on five minutes until the hour here on the  IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  I was telling Charles Rangel and the Gangster  Mickey that I don't weigh myself very often, occasionally I do.  I weighed  myself this morning and I'm about, I'm not quite 6 feet tall and I weigh  153 pounds.  But because of the way I wear my wranglers, if I weigh 153  pounds and not 150 pounds, I can't get them on.  So, it was just my  struggle this morning.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Jeff Greenfield.   </p><p>MCCORD:  A lot of issues.   </p><p>IMUS:  And Mary Matalin are both coming up, Gangster Mickey and Charles  Rangel, all that, just ahead.     </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  IMUS, IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN:  Hard to get on with the depends.   </p><p>IMUS:  What?   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT:  Hard to get on over the depends.  </p><p>IMUS:  What did you say?   </p><p>BARTLETT:  Hard to get on over the depends!  </p><p>IMUS:  Did I tell you what happened, I e-mail either one about Wyatt's  horse?   </p><p>BARTLETT:  No.   </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, God.  This is a horrible story.  At the ranch, he gets up at  5:00 in the morning, to go out at the barn with the cowboys, and they feed  all the animals.  Colder than hell, it's just miserable.  So, the Sunday  after Christmas, there wasn't anybody there, so he does it.  Even though  he's only 12, he can still drive the feed truck, I mean, so we bought him  his roping horse, buster, great roping horse, potentially great last  summer.  He goes up to the barn, he finds the horse dead in the stall.     </p><p>MCCORD:  Oh, no.   </p><p>IMUS:  The horse actually out in the run -- there's (inaudible) runs  outside the stall, some barns.  Anyway, the horse is on his back with his  leg stuck through the gate, dead.  So, he comes back, running down to the  house, screaming.  You can imagine.  His mother and I are asleep and I  couldn't, I thought it was one of the dogs have died, I couldn't imagine it  was his horse died.  So, we buried it and put a little note in with it and  oh, great. </p><p>MCCORD:  It's hard.   </p><p>IMUS:  Between the animals and I.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p>IMUS:  What did they -- hi, happy New Year.  What did they do when I was  gone, Connell?  Did you and Dagen fill in?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  We did you know the old \"BEST OF IMUS\", had some live  guests and also tossed to some of your segments, so yes it was Dagen and --  and me.

Seriously?</p><p>IMUS:  Yes, why?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, I'm just trying to say do you really mean that?</p><p>IMUS:  Why you'd think we would have you on the program if we didn't think  you were good.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right.  That's true.</p><p>IMUS:  We could be wrong.</p><p>MCSHANE:  As I said to you in the e-mail, where would you be without me?   Now that the rating is coming up and everything -- </p><p>IMUS:  We'd be number one and not number two.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes exactly.</p><p>IMUS:  That where we would be.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's -- that was your response.</p><p>IMUS:  Ok.

Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I'll do my best.  Good morning, I-Man.</p><p>Now, the markets here real quick for you this morning are really --  actually looking pretty good to start off the New Year with a survey that  came out of China, that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in  five months, but that has eased some of the concerns about inflation over  there and markets around the world are higher.</p><p>We'll go to Asia, first of all and show that the Chinese market, the bottom  of the screen, the Shanghai composite was up one and three quarters percent  overnight; Hong Kong and South Korea -- those are the other markets on the  screen -- were also up; and Japan has not yet resumed trading for the New  Year.</p><p>In Europe this morning stocks are gaining ground; London is closed for a  New Year's holiday but Paris is up almost two percent -- it was up more  than percent earlier so it's off the highs; and Germany up by 1.3 percent.   So a pretty good start to the day.</p><p>Now, our futures in the U.S. indicating the open on Wall Street, in two- and-a-half hours could be higher.  We're up 64 points on DOW futures.  And  in terms of how we finished 2010, remember it was good year for stocks.  I  mean, the major indexes were higher, the DOW by 11 percent, the S&amp;P by  nearly 13 percent and the NASDAQ, the best of the bunch, up almost 17  percent in 2010.</p><p>Now when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California Congressman  Darrell Issa gets a big promotion.

DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  We have about $1.7 trillion worth of  regulatory costs already in the government.  If the President wants to  throw another $300 billion or $400 billion, what he is doing is taking it  right out of businesses, right out of employment, right out of  competitiveness.  We need to make sure we can compete.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Now Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings, as  committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and  also, Medicare.</p><p>We're starting off the New Year with a busy week on the economic calendar  meantime.

Aren't they?</p><p>WOLF:  Oh terrible, change the rule.  Just because you win the division,  nothing, if you have a losing record, you're out and you are replaced by a  non-playoff team with the best record.</p><p>IMUS:  Why because the Giants are 10 -- 10-6.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes and as are the Buccaneers.</p><p>IMUS:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  I mean, the point is you want the best teams in there -- who cares - - </p><p>IMUS:  Why are -- why are the Seahawks so awful?</p><p>WOLF:  Well, the quarterback is no great shakes any more, Hasselbeck.  The  best player is Leon Washington, the kickoff return man they got from the  Jets.  And they're in the worst division -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  -- in the NFL.</p><p>IMUS:  So Pete Carroll hasn't made any difference going there?</p><p>WOLF:  No not this year, but he'll say, we don't care, we won the division.</p><p>IMUS:  Right.  The fans -- or some of the fans did in a poll they took,  didn't want them to win.  Did you know that?</p><p>WOLF:  No, well they bet on the rain -- </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I don't know what the deal was.</p><p>All right, six minutes after the hour.  And for the millions of you who of  course can't function in life without knowing how I am -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  -- and -- and many of you who idolize me, which I -- I can  understand.</p><p>MCCORD:  Hell, the I-Man.</p><p>IMUS:  -- because people in this country no longer have any taste.  That's  the reason.  I'm more successful now than I have ever been.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCORD:  And demonstrated by the ratings.</p><p>IMUS:  Which -- which demonstrates the clear decline of our society as we  know it.</p><p>MCCORD:  Oh yes.</p><p>IMUS:  But I had this biopsy on the 17th of December and that is why I was  not here so, to determine if in fact these things I had on my vocal cord  were cancerous.  And apparently they are not.</p><p>MCCORD:  Good.</p><p>IMUS:  But I had it over at Mt. Sinai but Dr. Wu did the biopsy.  He's a  great surgeon, doctor, and another guy who is fabulous, is a -- is a guy by  the name of Dr. Allen Reid, who is an anesthesiologist.  Fabulous.</p><p>And you know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and -- and -- and also Cornell,  but Mt. Sinai is a great hospital, starting with the nurses.  And it was  under general anesthesia, and what apparently I have are pre-cancerous  cells.  But -- but I got to thinking about it, all cells are pre-cancerous,  aren't they, but some are farther along the road than others.</p><p>MCCORD:  Certainly.</p><p>IMUS:  So the ones that I have are as far along the road as you want them  to get.</p><p>MCCORD:  Before getting rid of them.</p><p>IMUS:  Before getting rid of them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  So now they have to go on with the laser and laser them off.</p><p>MCCORD:  \"Star Wars\" them off there like that.</p><p>IMUS:  And which is according to Dr. Wu, who is a -- who is peek-a-boo Wu,  who is fabulous by the way.  It's an office thing, so -- apparently, I know  that is too much information for you.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes it is.</p><p>IMUS:  Apparently, I'm fine.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  And my voice is a little hoarse, but -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Not horrible.</p><p>IMUS:  Not horrible.</p><p>MCCORD:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  Here's Chuck with the news.

The grapevine area of I-5  closed indefinitely right now after cars began slipping and sliding all  over the place.  One driver says it was in fact pretty bad.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We found out about 15 minutes after I passed the  detour, so I could have saved myself a lot of time, but instead we spent an  hour-and-a-half of gridlock and now we have to go right back where we came  from, so I'm feeling a little silly about that.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD:  Winds were gusting to 90 miles an hour.  In mountain areas, snow  accumulating at elevations as low as 1,500 feet as the area continues to  suffer from the winter.</p><p>And the President in Hawaii, quietly signing the bill yesterday, that  provides aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks, all the first responders,  who became so sickened after working in the toxicity of Ground Zero.  New  York Senator Chuck Schumer worked hard to get the bill passed.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  It's been a long and arduous journey and  lots of us played a role, but the real credit goes to those first  responders.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD:  The President signed the measure privately in Hawaii and issued a  statement praising as he put it, \"The selfless courage demonstrated by the  firefighters, police officers and first responders who risked their lives\".</p><p>The bill provides $4.2 billion in aid to sickened workers and a few hundred  people who live near the burning pile at the Ground Zero, the Trade Center  site.</p><p>Jerry Brown, being sworn in as the Governor of California today, replacing  Governor Schwarzenegger; the ceremony takes place, downtown Sacramento this  morning with a reception scheduled then for late this afternoon.</p><p>Top Democrats says the President will work -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  Reception.</p><p>MCCORD:  Reception.

Why -- why and in that state -- </p><p>IMUS:  Aren't they about $90 trillion in debt?</p><p>MCCORD:  I think, $96 trillion, in the last -- in the last estimate.  But  you're absolutely right.</p><p>IMUS:  What a mess.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  It will be bring your own booze and crackers.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes and brown bag in it.</p><p>IMUS:  Well -- </p><p>MCCORD:  And the top Democrat says the President will work with the  Republican Congress but don't -- that doesn't mean he's going to buckle to  them.  Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine saying that there  will be disagreements.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TIM KAINE, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  If the Republicans are  willing to work as they did at the end of that lame duck session I think we  will see productive efforts in a number of ways.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD:  Kaine pointed to recent compromises on tax cuts, and this new  START treaty as proof of the possibility at least of some demonstration of  bipartisanship.</p><p>And researchers are making progress on a blood test that is interesting, to  say the least.  They say this will be able to spot a single cancer cell  among as many as a billion healthy ones.  The health care company, Johnson  &amp; Johnson, the giant company says it will join scientists at Massachusetts  General Hospital where the test was invented, to try to bring this thing to  market within the next several years.</p><p>Researchers think the test has the potential at least to transform care of  many types of cancer, especially breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer.   Doctors hope to use it to determine what treatment would be best for any  particular tumor or set of tumors.</p><p>Magnitude 7.1 earthquake, southern Chile, yesterday, prompted tens of  thousands to flee the coast for higher ground thinking that it might be  generating another tsunami like the one that ravaged the area last year.   There were no reports, though, of deaths, no tsunami alert was actually  issued.</p><p>A statement with the geological survey says the epicenter was about 45  miles away from the provincial capital of Temuco (ph) the population of  about a quarter million people.</p><p>IMUS:  You know the thing is around the world.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  And some of these various people like in Chile who already got  screwed in the -- in the genetic lottery.  Well, not the genetic lottery,  but the geographical lottery -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  -- by -- and then have to endure this.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Like Haiti, for example.</p><p>MCCORD:  Oh.</p><p>IMUS:  And Africa and -- these various places around the world, just get --  but just get screwed by one hideous catastrophe after another.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  It is 13 after the hour; Warner, do you have sports?</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Ok.

Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Ok, good morning, I-Man.</p><p>The market coming up at 11 percent gain in 2010 at least for the DOW and  nearly 17 percent rise for the NASDAQ, up again this morning indicating the  New Year will start off on a good note.</p><p>Then, there's a big story in the \"New York Times\" this morning about  Facebook, Goldman Sachs making a $500 million investment in Facebook  according to \"The Times\" and a Russian investor also making a sizable  investment and so the -- the value of Facebook according to these  investments would now be around $50 billion.</p><p>So Facebook would be worth more as \"The Times\" points out, than big tech  companies like eBay and Yahoo! and many others, but anyway, Facebook which  has obviously been a hot company for some time is getting a big investment  now from the -- one of the best known firms on -- or the best known firm on  Wall Street, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  And the -- the two twins from Harvard who are -- the rowing twins  out there in San Diego.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  -- who are suing what's his name?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Zuckerberg.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes they must be happy about this latest development.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, we'll see.  Well, they want -- they want their suit, they  settled it already for tens of millions of dollars but they want it now to  be thrown out so that their shares can be valued higher but Facebook has  won every legal challenge of that case which is of course the subject of  the movie, the \"Social Network\".</p><p>IMUS:  Well, the Connell McShane business report sponsored by Gorilla  Trades.  Get powerful stock picks for 30 days, sign up now at  GorillaTrades.com.  It's 14 after the hour.</p><p>Well, Charles had reported that the 9/11 responder bill was signed and \"The  New York Times\" had what I thought was kind of an amusing article,  particularly for those of us who are fans of Jon Stewart.  I suspect Mr.  Stewart probably thought it was amusing as well, but Bill Carter who writes  all of these books about the late night wars as though somebody cares --  judging by the best-seller list, no one does.</p><p>Compared Mr. Stewart to Everett R. Murrow, which because of Mr. Stewart's  rants about the Republicans, who wouldn't support the 9/11 responders bill  and which I thought he was right about.  But, I thought what made the  Republicans come around, of course, Bernie's now claiming that they were  able to get $3 billion out of the bill, so that they were -- so that they  would pass it.  But, whether they would have got that out or not, they were  shamed into passing it.</p><p>But I thought when Shep Smith from Fox News was on Fox News, of course.   And he had seen the Jon Stewart Show the night before.  And so he was  talking about it.  And when -- he did this spontaneous wrap about how  shameful it was that the Republicans were dragging their feet, refusing to  pass the bill, and I saw him when he did it.  And it appeared to be  spontaneous but, in my view, the Republicans watching this could have  endured Jon Stewart ragging on them and would have, because it happens all  the time. </p><p>But, boy, I would be willing to bet when they turned on Fox News with the  huge audience that they have and here's Shep Smith with his -- huge  audience that he has.  And they lost him, then they've lost the fight.   Here's Shep Smith.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Last night on Jon Stewart -- it was Jon  Stewart's last show of the week and ok, we watched it, whatever.  And he  just flat on -- absolutely right and it's worth saying, who's going to hold  these people's feet to the fire when we're able to put a 52-story building  down there so far at Ground Zero.</p><p>We're able to pay for tax cuts from billionaires who don't need them and  it's not going to stimulate the economy but we can't give health care to  Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire?  Went down there  to save people?</p><p>Did people know what the city was like that day; people walking over  bridges, they were covered in ash.  They were running for their lives.   They were crying.  Their family members were dead and these people ran to  Ground Zero to save people's lives.  And we're not going to give them  medicine for the illnesses they got down there?</p><p>It is disgusting, it's a national disgrace.  It's a shame and everybody who  voted against it should have to stand up and account for him or herself.   Is anybody going to hold them accountable?  </p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I think you just did.  </p><p>SMITH:  I'm not really in a position to do that.  I mean I think I just  kind of went out there and said what the truth is.  And I feel like, I feel  like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people.</p><p>There was no warning label on Ground Zero, on 9/11 that these substances  will kill you.  And even if there had been they would have gone anyway.   They just need a little bit of help.</p><p>It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things.  We spend a lot  more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do, doing  anything for those people, don't we?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  That is Shep Smith, Fox News.  That is big time -- tell me about Fox  News.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  With Chris Wallace.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Well, he's just sitting there, sucking his thumb -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  You had brought that up with Chris Wallace prior to that  conversation and then that following Sunday, Chris Wallace brought it up to  several politician on his program as well.  </p><p>IMUS:  That is big time, Shep Smith.  You know, and all the Lobster  Newburghs of the world.  Those of you who run around and won't watch Fox  News -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Pay attention.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes, pay attention.  They're not doing that -- I didn't see Diane  Sawyer doing that.  I didn't see that wimp, who by the way won't be in the  \"Profiles in Courage\" book, Brian Williams.  I didn't see him or the little  rodent over there at CBS doing anything.</p><p>Did you?  Did you see any of them?  Did they have a word to say about that?   Who did have a word to say about it?  Shep Smith.</p><p>So -- 19 after the hour.  Get to Warner in sports in a minute.  Calm down.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  In the news this morning, Expedia dropping American Airlines  fares from its Web site.  It's the latest development in this conflict that  has been growing between the airlines and on-line travel agencies since  American cut ties with Orbitz.  The airline says Expedia intentionally  listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.</p><p>American is looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own Web sites  in an effort to save money.  Expedia says the move will only cost them  ticket sales and believes American's efforts are bad for travelers.  Well,  there you have it.</p><p>Stocks starting off the New Year with some gains here after a monthly  survey in China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five  months and that's worked to ease some inflation concerns.</p><p>Over in Europe this morning, stocks are higher and London is closed for a  New Year's holiday but both Paris and Frankfurt are gaining ground.</p><p>Our futures are also higher, ahead of the open on Wall Street which is  coming a little over two hours from now.  We're up 67 points on Dow  futures.</p><p>And commodities, oil is up at $92 a barrel; and gold down, just slightly.</p><p>So, that's a look at some of your top stories and now over to Charles for  more of this morning's top stories.  </p><p>MCCORD:  And they include today, Connell, this -- another big storm hitting  southern California; snow and 90 mile-an-hour winds were reported in some  locations and authorities have shut done the so-called grapevine portion of  I-5, north of Los Angeles.</p><p>President Obama signing into law the measure that passes -- that pays,  rather, for medical care for first responders to the 9/11 terror attacks,  New York, '01.  The legislation sets up this $4 billion compensation fund  to help those people.</p><p>And a top navy officer under fire for producing and appearing in a series  of raunchy orientation videos, broadcast to nearly 6,000 crewmembers of the  USS Enterprise.  In the videos Captain Owen Honors and other crewmembers  can be seen cursing and using anti-gay slurs among other things.</p><p>Those are some of the headlines as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program  continues now right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS:  Twenty-five after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.   It's a prime example Bernard, of what I was talking to you about off the  air.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>IMUS:  Idiot sales department (INAUDIBLE) -- they're all talking about it  now.  They write these commercials and the commercials are 90 seconds long,  but they pay for 60 seconds.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  So I read for 60 seconds and then I stop reading so I don't know  what they want left in or out or who knows.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Essential information, right.  </p><p>IMUS:  And I want to help them out, one of them is for GNC, it's a great  nutrition center, they're great.</p><p>I have no idea what they -- by the way, at this point if they're not on top  of it and the stupid sales department at the radio station is not, then, I  can't be worried about it.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Too much.  </p><p>IMUS:  And now I've got myself all worked up here and I was doing fine up  to now.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Time for sports and here with that is the great Warner  Wolf.  Good morning, Warner.  </p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Good morning.  Thank you, I-man.</p><p>Well, completing the play-off picture last night, the Seahawks finishing 7- 9, beat the Rams 16-6; they win the NFC west.  And as you said, even the  Seattle fans wanted the Seahawks to lose so they would get a higher draft  pick.</p><p>The Packers win the wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3.   The Colts win  the AFC south, beating the Titans, 23-20.  Although they didn't know it at  the time, they had already won it minutes earlier because the Jags lost.   Steelers win the AFC.  Falcons win the NFC. </p><p>And finally, I-man, MVP, there's going to be no question about it, Tom  Brady finishes with 36 touchdowns and just four interceptions.</p><p>IMUS:  How did he play -- he's playing better than he ever has.  </p><p>WOLF:  Ever, all-time.  Not anytime.  </p><p>IMUS:  No.  </p><p>WOLF:  Not every time -- </p><p>IMUS:  That will be fine.</p><p>WOLF:  Not Greenwich Time.  </p><p>IMUS:  That will be fine.  Time for a little business news now, oh, my God.   And here with that is the girl with the purple dress on, purple rain,  purple rain.  Dagen McDowell -- good morning Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, sir.  I was trying to get  all gussied up for your return.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I'm glad you did.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  At least I came back from Christmas with all my teeth  because there's always that danger.  </p><p>IMUS:  How would you lose your teeth?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A fight, fall down or there's always that, you know, peanut  brittle sitting around the house.  </p><p>IMUS:  Or Santa come down that chimney and you're there under the tree and  haven't been rubbing that Chamonix on yourself and so Santa would be  disappointed, wouldn't he?  And look like you been left out in the rain,  girl.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He would punch me -- would punch me in the mouth.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, let's hope not.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For not keeping my skin soft and supple.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, anyway, what's going on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  The movie business was boo -- bad last year.   Overall attendance was down more than 5 percent; the lowest number of  tickets sold to the movies since 1996.  Now, total revenue was north of $10  billion because ticket prices are higher.  People are going to 3-D movies,  which cost more money, but one, one notable disappointment was that Johnny  Depp-Angelina Jolie movie \"The Tourist\" at end of the year.  So, I reckon  paying have gotten tired of paying to see that hussy with the puffy lips  stand around.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why are you offing (ph) on her.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why?</p><p>IMUS:  You don't like her -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't.  No, not at all.</p><p>IMUS:  You know who seems kind of cute is Reese Witherspoon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that movie didn't do so well either; that new movie that  she's in.  </p><p>IMUS:  She's going to marry her agent, you know.  Did you know that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes, I did.  Jim Toff (ph) is his name, by the way.  </p><p>IMUS:  And how about Shania Twain?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Getting married to the ex-husband of the woman that Mutt Lang,  Shania's ex-husband, left her for.  Yes. </p><p>IMUS:  Now, that's a trailer park -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RUFINO:  I'm my own grandpa right there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you know what?  That's why you got to love her.</p><p>IMUS:  Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  All's well that ends well.  She grew up hard knocks, man.   Now she's found love.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, I know she did.  Yes.  I thought she's good.  I've always liked  her, but the girl -- she married Mutt Lange who produced all her records.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  And he -- didn't he produce Def Leppard for a long time?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, he did.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And Foreigner.</p><p>IMUS:  Foreigner.  So he's a great record producer.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  But apparently that wasn't enough and she wasn't enough.  So he was  having an affair with her assistant, right, or his assistant.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  She was like the house manager, I thought, something  like that.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.  And so, Shania, of course, found out about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And it was Shania's best friend.</p><p>IMUS:  And Shania's best friend.  Sure.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD:  Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS:  So he was always there, that's unfortunate.  So now, are they  married now?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know if they're married.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, but that woman's ex-husband, they are married, OK.  Mutt  and the woman -- Mutt and the woman are married and the woman's ex-husband  just married Shania.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I feel dizzy right now.</p><p>MCCORD:  Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS:  Now, Shania, she's down in Nashville.  There's a bunch of people  available, a bunch of these good looking cowboy singers.  And I just, I  just didn't understand that.  That's sort of screwed up, isn't it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, he's hot.</p><p>IMUS:  He is?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The guy she married is smoking, yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, he is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's like -- yes, he's European looking.  He's --</p><p>IMUS:  He's cute?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, all right.  Well, never mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And those cowboys will cheat on you quicker than they'll sneeze,  so why drive down that road again?</p><p>IMUS:  Well, Mutt Lange is not a cowboy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know, but the cowboys will cheat, too.  Find a man who will  stay honest to you.</p><p>IMUS:  Like Tim McGraw, he married, down the road with what's her name.   Figure, well, why not, so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What a tough decision for him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Faith Hill or hmmm -- I wonder --</p><p>IMUS:  Years ago -- years ago, my brother and Phil Sweet wrote a song  called \"\"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You, which eventually went to number  one.  It won the Music City News Record of the Year, country record, and is  recorded by Jim Ed Brown of The Browns, you know.  And Helen Cornelius.</p><p>Now, Helen, she was married.  Well, you know where this story is going.   And so was Jim, he was married.  But they get this big hit record \"I Don't  Want to Have to Marry You\", I don't want to have to say I do.  And so  they're on tour and they're on the bus and they discovered some -- one of  them, one of the husbands or either her husband or his wife discovered that  between the two compartments on the bus where Jim Ed Brown would sleep and  where the other compartment where old Helen was asleep, there was a trap  door.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD:  No way.</p><p>IMUS:  There's like a, where your dog comes in and out.  So one of them was  wiggling through the trap door.</p><p>MCCORD:  Oh, for crying out loud.</p><p>IMUS:  I don't want to have to marry you.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.  I don't have to go through that trap door.</p><p>IMUS:  Man, oh, man.</p><p>All right, 33 after the hour.  Jeff Greenfield is coming up.  But first,  time for a briefing sponsored by our friends at P.C. Richard &amp; Son.  And  here with that is Bernard McGuirk.</p><p>Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yo, chief.  Well, a lot happened since the break began for us a  couple of weeks ago.  The Bush tax cuts extended, \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\"  repealed.  The death panels are back and Obamacare and the blizzard of 2010  further revealed Mayor Mike Bloomberg could be the arrogant schmuck we all  knew he was.</p><p>IMUS:  Two best news.  The \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and the 9/11 responder  bill.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.  That was signed just yesterday by the president in Hawaii,  robbing Chuck Schumer of his moment in the spotlight.  He couldn't be there  at the signing.  However, before all this happened, Larry King signed off  and during that show, a funny thing happened while Larry King was  interviewing Bill Clinton which pretty much went unnoticed.  They were  talking about both being heart surgeon patients, members of the \"zipper  club\" but that was a little confusing.  But here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOICE OF: LARRY KING, HOST, \"LARRY KING LIVE\":  You look well fit.  Are you  feeling well?</p><p>VOICE OF: BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I feel great.   I've been traveling quite a bit, but as you pointed out I just got back  from Haiti.  And I'm kind of like you, I have to keep working.  I don't  know if it keeps me young, but at least it keeps me out of the grave.</p><p>KING:  We're both in the \"zipper club.\" By the way, the suits want me to  remind you what the \"zipper club\" is.  It's if you've had open heart  surgery, they have to zipper it up.  So I thought everyone in the world  knew it but apparently --</p><p>CLINTON:  I'm glad you clarified that.</p><p>KING:  I see what you mean.  Oh, oh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  The big dog acknowledging and can be self-deprecating at this  point.</p><p>IMUS:  Of course, we lost a character when Larry -- what's Larry going to  do now?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, he's still going to work.  He's going to be a contributor.</p><p>He better, right.  He has to be.</p><p>IMUS:  Wasn't he ragging on Hannity and Rachel Maddow?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  He did somewhere.  I read something about that.  He was --</p><p>IMUS:  Both of them were kicking his ass, by the way.  Hannity by a lot and  her by some.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  So --</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Hannity drove Larry King off the air, essentially.</p><p>IMUS:  So he gets on.  He's bad-mouthing Rachel Maddow and Hannity who were  both killing him.</p><p>All right, Greenfield is next.  Twenty-five until the hour.</p><p>MUSIC:  Oh, I love the clothes she wears and the way the sunlight plays  upon her hair.  Oh, I hear the sound of a church bell off the wind that  lifts her perfume through the air.  I'm picking up good vibrations.  She's  giving me the excitations.  I'm picking up good vibrations.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, I'm so irritable this morning that I just don't know if I can  recover.</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  The bailout program for boring radio.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a business  update from the FOX Business Network.  Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  All right.  Here's  your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>As many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's day,  there was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock features.  Users have set  their alarm for a single wakeup.  Found it didn't go off when 2011 arrived.   An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all alarms will work  properly starting today.  But apparently users in Europe and Asia say they  are still having some problems.</p><p>Vizio, the maker of inexpensive flat-screen TVs looking now to expand.  The  \"Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell  phones and tablet computers.  The two products, the Via Phone and the Via  Tablet will be introduced this summer from the company.  The announcement  comes days ahead of the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.</p><p>As for the markets this morning, let's check in on the futures once again.   They've been higher all morning long.  Dow futures now up by 84 points as  IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p>SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning.  I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan  from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast.</p><p>You can see we do still have rain showers here in the southwest and snow  showers in the higher elevations.  Most of the U.S. is looking very clear.   And as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers  and some rain showers in New England along the coastline.  The midsection,  lots of sunshine.  A slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis.  And as we  look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're  going to see very many if any delays travel-wise because of the weather,  other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to that rain- snow mix.</p><p>I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program on the FOX Business  Network. </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Nineteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Mary Matlin is coming up.  Tomorrow, Tom Friedman.  And then on  Wednesday, Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus, \"Blond on Blond.\"  This portion of  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by Time Warner cable business  class.  You first, the technology follows.</p><p>Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from CBS News, Jeff  Greenfield.  Good morning, Mr. Greenfield.</p><p>JEFF GREENFIELD, CBS NEWS (via telephone):  Good morning, Don.  Happy New  Year.</p><p>IMUS:  Happy New Year to you.  I apologize for being late.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  You know, it's -- I mean, I would not have missed the  conversation about all those country stars and their lives for anything.   So it was fine, you know?</p><p>IMUS:  I sense a note of sarcasm in your voice.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  No.  Me, on this show?  Don't be silly.</p><p>IMUS:  It just hurts my feelings because --</p><p>GREENFIELD:  No, you are the audio version of Oprah's new network.  Nothing  but good feelings.</p><p>IMUS:  I wonder how that's going to work out for her.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  You know, I don't know.  It's in a way unprecedented that an  entire network is built around the appeal of one person although she's  hardly, you know, your ordinary figure.  And I guess it involves everything  from whether or not some of her viewers are going to want to pay the extra  fee.  She's not on pay cable, but on a lot of network, a lot of cable  systems she's not on the basic cable.  There is some fluff about that.  And  the real question is, I guess, can you sustain 24 hours based on the world  view of one person although as I say in her case that's just one  extraordinary media figure.  I mean, she certainly has built something over  the years that is just unprecedented in, you know, media.  So good luck to  her.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes, I like her.  I don't know why I like her.  I don't watch her  show, I just like her.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  She's a -- I can say -- I think, I think you don't connect at  that level with so many people at that level of intensity unless there's  something there, you know.</p><p>IMUS:  Maybe Barbara Walters should have asked her if she was a lesbian?</p><p>GREENFIELD:  I don't know, Don.  Let me take that under prayerful  consideration.</p><p>IMUS:  I wonder what you thought.  I didn't so, I like Barbara Walters,  too.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  Well, OK.</p><p>IMUS:  So the 9/11 responders bill is signed that finally, huh?</p><p>GREENFIELD:  Yes, and I think you were very wise in showing that clip from  Shep Smith, because I think between him and Stuart, you had -- I think Shep  is a straight arrow newscaster, but certainly the FOX Network is watched  overwhelmingly by folks of a conservative persuasion and Stuart's show is  watched overwhelmingly by folks with a liberal persuasion.  When you have  people on both sides coming at that issue and basically saying shame to the  people who voted against it, I think those twin factors played a big role  in getting that bill through.</p><p>IMUS:  Do you know if many Democrats watch FOX News somewhere?</p><p>GREENFIELD:  No, they do, because, first of all, FOX News as a cable  network is by far the most watched cable network, and it isn't that  Democrats don't watch it. But in the surveys that I have seen over the  years and it shouldn't surprise anybody, the predominantly majority view of  those who watch tends to the right.  It's just the predominant view of  those who watch MSNBC tends to the left.  And this is about reassurance and  reaffirmation of what you believe is right.</p><p>I may have told you the story.  I talked once to a Democratic senator who  told me that the television set is always on at MSNBC at home.  And I said  why after 12 hours of debate in the Senate, you go home and watch more  politics?  And the answer was, it's like soaking in a nice warm bath, you  know.  And I think that's true for a lot of people who turn on a cable news  network, that basically tells them what you basically think that's right.   And I think it's one of the reasons why my former places of business, CNN,  had such a prime time ratings.  There are a lot of others, but people  basically I think, that is to say the people who watch cable news, and  remember it's a big minority of television viewers.  You're talking about  three percent of, you know, television homes.  Folks turn that stuff on  either to be told they're right or in the case of, you know, Democrats  watching FOX or Republicans watching MSNBC to get the blood going.</p><p>IMUS:  I was so happy we were able to get you away from CNN over to CBS.  I  can't tell you.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  Well, I'm sure you played your part.</p><p>IMUS:  I hated the fact.  Well, I kept saying to Rick Kaplan, who was a big  fan of yours, by the way, as are a lot of people.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  He's now one of my bosses.  He's the executive producer of  Katie Couric's show.</p><p>IMUS:  Why wouldn't you be -- why wouldn't we get Greenfield over to CBS  News and get him out of that hell hole over there.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  The only thing I can tell you is the cafeteria at CNN was much  better than the cafeteria at CBS.</p><p>IMUS:  Did you watch the Rose Bowl?</p><p>GREENFIELD:  I did, that's my alma mater.</p><p>IMUS:  That's what I asked.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  I thought it was a really good game.  I was the only big 10  team that was competitive I think in all those -- how many bowl games are  there now?  About 35 quite literally?</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  So it's one missed field goal.</p><p>IMUS:  That was my only connection to the game is I knew that you had gone  to school there before you went to Harvard or Yale, wherever the hell you  went.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  Yes, right.</p><p>IMUS:  And that they were playing TCU.  Of course, I was rooting for TCU,  but that's just because I'm a big Texas fan.  So --</p><p>GREENFIELD:  Well, Bob Schieffer is.  In fact, I regretted the fact that he  and I didn't get a bet down.  Although now that Wisconsin lost, I don't  know would have had to -- I don't know what I would have had to do, you  know, appeared on the air in a TCU warm-up jacket.  I guess that was a  really good game and I must say that, you know, I didn't, I didn't call the  University of Wisconsin in high dungeon and say no more contributions from  me because you lost the football game.  That's perhaps taking it a bit too  far.</p><p>IMUS:  If you're one of the people like I am who thinks that Sarah Palin is  -- I don't know if I think she's a dope or not, but whatever.  But let me  ask you this, how much worse off would the country or better off would the  country be where she president? </p><p>GREENFIELD:  You know what?</p><p>IMUS:  The answer is not --</p><p>GREENFIELD:  First of all -- no, first, she's dumb like a fox.  I mean,  here's somebody who's turned the governorship of Alaska and an unsuccessful  bid for vice-president into a multi-million dollar empire where she gets to  talk only to people who like her for $100,000 a more pop, you know, is a  favorite on the most watched cable news network in the country and makes  millions of dollars selling books.  This is how dumb she is.</p><p>IMUS:  Very good.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  Yes, that's --</p><p>Two Cadillacs outside.</p><p>IMUS:  You remember.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking of when people talk  about how dumb he is, that preacher guy.</p><p>One of my favorite routines.  But you know, that's a question probably  better asked to people who -- who would ideologically tend to be on her  side.  I think it's really interesting that either a majority or maybe  close to of Republicans don't think she's qualified to be president.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  So what she has is an enormously intensely loyal base of  people who like her and think any criticism of her is just an example of  left wing media bias.</p><p>IMUS:  Maybe it's a little like Oprah.  We all like her but we just don't  want her to run anything.</p><p>All right.  I've got to go, but thank you very much.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  -- that analogy completely, but I do think that she's going to  have a significant role whether she's a candidate or not in 2012.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  I've got to go.</p><p>GREENFIELD:  OK.  Well, Happy New Year and it's two months to start  plugging my book like a banshee (ph).</p><p>IMUS:  I will do anything for you.  Jeff Greenfield, CBS News.</p><p>MUSIC:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  The stocks starting  off the new year with some gains here.  The monthly survey coming out of  China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and  that actually is easing some inflation concerns and some optimism about our  economy as well, ahead of some key economic data points later in the week.   Europe is up across the board.  London is closed today for the New Year's  holiday.  And our futures are up across the board.  The Dow futures ahead  of the open on Wall Street now up almost triple digits.  So we're adding to  the gains as we get closer to the open.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants  to put on the market.  The blood test is billed as being able to spot a  single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells.

And it is.  And gold after being lower earlier  has now turned slightly higher.</p><p>More news coming up at the top of the hour but it's IMUS IN THE MORNING  that continues right now.  FOX Business, power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS:  We got so far behind.  So what are you saying now?  We haven't lost  Larry King?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  So this is pathetic.</p><p>BARTLETT:  Why?</p><p>IMUS:  Can't you come up with something else?  You're a professional  comedian.</p><p>BARTLETT:  I happen to come up with something else.  He's a great  character.  You don't want to lose him.</p><p>MCCORD:  He's still going to be around doing specials and stuff.  He's just  not going to have a show.</p><p>TONY POWELL:  You're going to make him to do whatever --</p><p>BARTLETT:  We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS:  What?</p><p>BARTLETT:  We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, yes, but that's different.</p><p>MCCORD:  That's Nixon.</p><p>POWELL:  Yes, it's Nixon.</p><p>IMUS:  It's Nixon.</p><p>MCCORD:  No, but you --</p><p>IMUS:  You're saying we can still do Larry King?</p><p>BARTLETT:  Why not?  It's not like he's dead.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, yes, he is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD:  But that's been for a while.</p><p>IMUS:  He's a no-good bastard, by the way.</p><p>MCCORD:  Who?</p><p>IMUS:  Larry King.  I used to be friends with him, but he's a creep.  And  his wife is a bigger creep.</p><p>POWELL:  What are you saying?</p><p>BARTLETT:  How about Rex Ryan?</p><p>IMUS:  What about him?</p><p>BARTLETT:  Him as a character.</p><p>IMUS:  That's a weird dude, you know that.</p><p>BARTLETT:  You think.</p><p>IMUS:  No, but I mean, that toe-sucking thing?</p><p>BARTLETT:  Well, that was, you know --</p><p>IMUS:  Don't you think that's --</p><p>BARTLETT:  I think what's interesting at first is the tripping controversy.</p><p>IMUS:  And that girl got some fudgy feet, too, by the way.  Did you see her  feet?</p><p>MCCORD:  Saw the photographs, yes.</p><p>IMUS:  She should be wearing brogans.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: So I said to Carly (ph), how are you, happy New Year. So I say to  Carly, I want a -- I'm drinking this tea that is supposed to kill cancer  cells.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So -- and I'm happy to do it. So I said I wanted another cup. So she  just brings over an empty cup, you know -- </p><p>MCSHANE: Good for her. You deserve that. </p><p>IMUS: But I -- because I didn't specify what I wanted.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But it turns out we're out of the tea, so -- anyway, Seahawks won the  football game last night, in case you just turned your -- whatever you have  on, on. Your toaster.</p><p>MCSHANE: Your toaster.</p><p>IMUS: And -- </p><p>MCSHANE: Seven and nine in the playoffs. </p><p>IMUS: Yes, which doesn't make any sense to me, but I don't care. So, are  you a football fan, Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE: No, I'm a Jet fan. I was at the Jet game yesterday with my son and  it was fun. And they won their -- well, they were already in the playoffs,  but they won. So they go 11-5. </p><p>IMUS: Why would you pick a game to go to that meant nothing? </p><p>MCSHANE: Because you know why -- that's actually a good point. But we  hadn't been to a game at the new stadium yet. So I decided on Saturday, the  weather wasn't going to be too cold and he had never been to a game at the  new stadium, so let's go. So we went. </p><p>IMUS: What kind of seats did you have? </p><p>MCSHANE: We had good seats. We were right behind -- they were actually in  the second row -- they were technically in the 11th row but they were right  behind the tunnel, you know, where the players run in. So they were in the  second row behind that tunnel in the end zone and three of the touchdowns  were right in our end zone, right where we were sitting. So it was pretty  cool. </p><p>IMUS: Did you buy the tickets? </p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I bought them on -- I just bought them on Stub Hub the day  before the game, online. </p><p>IMUS: Wouldn't there be some way, if you were going to go, you could -- you  could let me know and then we could call Warner -- </p><p>MCSHANE: Right. </p><p>IMUS: And have you sit in the box with the owner? </p><p>MCSHANE: You know what, but then I'd owe you something. </p><p>IMUS: You owe me a lot now, by the way, (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. </p><p>IMUS: It's time for a little business news now and here is Connell McShane. </p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: I didn't want to add to it. </p><p>Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Now, let's look at the markets here this morning to see how things are  starting off the week. Stocks -- starting off the year, really. It's the  first trading day of the year with some gains. There's a monthly survey out  of China that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five  months, and that's easing concerns about inflation. If you look at Asia,  for example, the Shanghai composite, the Chinese market at the bottom of  the screen, up 1.75 percent. Kospi in South Korea, Hang Seng in Hong Kong  all up on the day. Japan has not yet resumed trading in the new year. </p><p>In Europe, stocks are up. London's close also today because of the New  Year's holiday. Paris is up 2 percent. Look at that. Germany up 1.3  percent. And our futures indicating the open on Wall Street in an hour and  a half is going to be significantly higher. Dow futures up almost triple  digits, up 92 points.</p><p>All right. Now, in terms of how we fared last year, as it is, in 2010,  there's the recap. The Dow up 11 percent. The S&amp;P almost 13 percent. And  the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, higher by almost 17 percent.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on even  more debt. The national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion  ceiling. White House Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Austan Goolsbee  on ABC \"This Week\" saying it's crucial that ceiling is raised. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: This is not a  game. You know, the debt ceiling is not -- is not something to toy with.  That's the -- the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that's the -- essentially  defaulting on our obligations, which is totally unprecedented in American  history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree that it needs to be raised, but many are  also saying they wouldn't go along with that unless they get promises to  change Washington's spending habits. They argue there's no point in even  having a debt ceiling if it's simply raised every time the national debt  gets close. </p><p>Bank of America taking a $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter. It's  related to mortgages sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bank making  the payment to Fannie and Freddie as part of a settlement over mortgages  sold by Countrywide Financial. Now, Bank of America, remember, bought  Countrywide three years ago and Bank of America shares are actually rising  this morning on the news. </p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants  to put in the open -- on the market. Now, the blood test is billed as being  able to spot a single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells. J&amp;J is  teaming with the scientists who invented the test to make it cheaper and  better. The hope is that the blood tests can take the place of more  invasive cancer tests. </p><p>And many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day.  There was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock feature. Users who set their  alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't even -- it didn't go off when  2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all  alarms, they say, will be working properly starting today. </p><p>As for commodities this morning, the oil price has been up above $92 a  barrel and is higher than that now as well. $1,423 or thereabouts for gold.  Up $2 after being lower earlier. </p><p>Mary Matalin coming up a little bit later this hour with the I-man as IMUS  IN THE MORNING continues right now here at Fox Business, giving you the  power to prosper. </p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING. </p><p>IMUS: I can't hear you. (INAUDIBLE) here. What's the matter with you?</p><p>It is five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Mary Matalin is coming up. </p><p>Well, I can't hear you. We're trying to -- we're sitting here talking about  the guy who does the \"Red Eye\" show on the Fox News Channel. It's on at  3:00 a.m. Gary -- </p><p>MCGUIRK: Greg.</p><p>IMUS: Gray --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Gutfield.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfield.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Or Feld. Feld, actually.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfeld.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I said, I had a suspicion that he might be pretty good. My wife  says he is. And now here's how he came to my attention, because I was  watching the Fox New Year's Eve thing. I was out at the ranch.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I was watching Megyn Kelly, who I like, and Bill Hemmer, who I  like him, too. And they were just way too happy. I mean that girl was so  happy, she was beside herself. And she's about 29 months pregnant. So she's  got the baby coming up here. </p><p>MCCORD: Sure. </p><p>IMUS: And they were just hysterical. Now, I didn't stay with them to see  the ball come down, because I don't do that. If you -- if you watch the  ball come down -- </p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man. </p><p>IMUS: You can't be a bigger loser in life. You can't do it. And if you're  there, most of the people in Times Square itself are from somewhere else.  They're tourists. They're not -- there's no New Yorkers who I know, and  I've been here for a long time, 30 years, who go there and stand there and,  you know, let people pee on you while they -- while you're waiting for the  ball to come down. I just don't think that happens, do you, Connell? </p><p>MCSHANE: No. </p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's not going to happen.</p><p>IMUS: All right. So, I was asking about -- so, anyway, he was on, the \"Red  Eye\" guy, not the radio red eye guy, the other one, the TV \"Red Eye\" guy.  And so we -- I thought, well, let's have him on. Let's have him as a guest.  But first we have to find -- I mean I'm not interested in -- we didn't get  to be a successful as we are by experimenting, although we did used to do  that. But we don't do that anymore. We don't experiment with talent. So, I  guess, what's the matter, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: There's something on your shoulder, I-man. </p><p>IMUS: There is? </p><p>MCCORD: Yes, on your --</p><p>MCSHANE: Your coming apart.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you know, hey, Connell --</p><p>MCCORD: Uh-oh.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, Trevor. You know what happened?</p><p>MCGUIRK: (INAUDIBLE). Damn it, someone! </p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Easy mistake.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Can you hear us now, chief? He can't hear us. </p><p>IMUS: No, I can't hear you, you little bastard. </p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, thanks for telling us. </p><p>IMUS: Hey, Connell, this thing -- I mean, Trevor, this thing came loose  again. </p><p>MCSHANE: I'll fix it for you. </p><p>IMUS: Well, actually, he can fix it.</p><p>All right, time for a little news and here with that -- </p><p>MCSHANE: Is Trevor.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter? </p><p>MCCORD: Just the ongoing saga of the ear monitors. </p><p>IMUS: These are my $1,500 ear monitors. </p><p>MCCORD: There's something every freakin' 15 minutes. </p><p>IMUS: That won't stay together. </p><p>MCGUIRK: But what about Greg Gutfeld? </p><p>IMUS: Well, we're going to watch him -- I'm going to watch his show tonight  --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: And if he's any good, we'll have him on. I bet he must be, wouldn't  you think? Have you ever seen it, Bernie? </p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. I have not really seen the show. It's on, as you said, 3:00  in the morning, no.</p><p>IMUS: My wife says he's good. </p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And Opie, Anthony -- Anthony's on a lot, right? </p><p>BARTLETT: Supposedly. </p><p>IMUS: Well, we know Anthony's funny. I'll listen (ph).</p><p>Here's Chuck with the news. </p><p>MCCORD: The president says he is honored to have signed the bill to provide  the aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks and first responders who became  ill working at Ground Zero. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation  Act, named after a police officer who died of a respiratory disease that he  contracted during the 9/11 operations, his father now says he is happy  others will finally be getting the help they need. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an important not only because my son was sick  for four years, you know, and we watched him die and we couldn't get no  help for him. Now -- there was -- no one would recognize that he was sick  from the World Trade Center. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: The bill provides $4.2 billion in help to sick workers and several  hundred people who live near the burning pile, the toxicity at the World  Trade Center ruins. The president signing the measure in private as his  Hawaiian vacation neared its end. </p><p>IMUS: Bill Carter, a journalist from \"The New York Times,\" who's a nice  guy, by the way. Writes all these books about the late night talk show wars  that nobody cares about and no one reads. And -- but they're good. I guess  I read them. (INAUDIBLE). He and some other clown wrote an article over the  past couple of weeks about Jon Stewart being perhaps the new Edward R.  Murrow --</p><p>MCCORD: Crusader. </p><p>IMUS: Which I suspect even Mr. Stewart, who I am a fan of --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Found amusing. If not ironic, except every time I use the word  ironic, with apologies to Nora Ephron, I always wonder if I'm using it  correctly.</p><p>MCCORD: Correct.</p><p>IMUS: And I suspect I'm not. But at any rate, because Stewart was railing  about the Republicans who had embraced tragedy of 9/11 as almost their  campaign mantra slogan deal, and that they were not entitled to do that  anymore because essentially they had refused, which I thought was a  disgrace and so did Mr. Stewart. So he talked about it. Then he had some of  the responders on. So they were, Mr. Carter and some other dope from \"The  Times,\" were crediting Mr. Stewart with providing the impetus for this to  be passed, which I thought, well, it might have brought some attention to  it, but it certainly didn't spur any Republicans to change their minds  about it or to feel some sort of necessity to take action on this and to  realize how absolutely disgraceful they were behaving. </p><p>But I saw Shep Smith -- I played this last hour and it's worth playing  again. I'll tell you why. Because he does the news on -- he does the news  two hours on it on the Fox News Channel. And some of my friends, like  Esther Newberg, I love her to death, but is one of these elitist, liberal  snobs who, you know, they all think they have all the answers and she's one  of these people who refuses to watch Fox News because she thinks they have  some sort of agenda and yet, like a moron, she'll watch MSNBC or CNN, who  are both dreadful and disgraceful and clearly do have an agenda or, say,  CBS or ABC or, for God's sake, NBC. </p><p>So I would call her attention, and I would call to Mr. Carter's attention  as well, what Shep Smith had to say about it. And Shep Smith -- I'm going  to play it in a second -- referenced Jon Stewart. What I think is  significant about it is, is that if you're a Republican like John Thune, I  had that dope on, and some of these other people who were dragging their  feet and just refusing to vote on this, and Senator Thune had these lame  excuses that he gave me. And much to my discredit, I didn't press him on it  and should have, but I thought, well, he didn't want to rush into anything  and it was too much other money was -- it was a bunch of pork and stuff in  it and even that was kind of Bernie's rap on this. And people like Hannity  and some of these other dopes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Those are the facts. </p><p>IMUS: The facts are nothing. The point is -- the facts are stupid. The  point is, it should have been passed and, of course, now it was passed and  they did take out about $3 billion of pork.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: My point, God, if I could make the point, is that when Shep Smith  talked about it, that got the attention of all of the Republicans and  everyone else, because they're thinking, if Shep Smith, with that enormous  audience that he has and that Fox News has, if he's against this, then as  Walter Cronkite famously said or Lyndon Johnson said about Walter Cronkite  during the Vietnam War, if we've lost him, we've lost the country. Here's  Shep Smith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS: Last night on Jon Stewart, it was Jon Stewart's last  (INAUDIBLE) of the week and, OK, we watch it. Whatever. And he's just flat  on, absolutely right. And it's worth saying, who's going to hold these  people's feet to the fire when we -- you know, we're able to put a 52 story  building down there so far at Ground Zero. We're able to pay for tax cuts  for billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the  economy, but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who  ran right into the fire, went down there to save people. The people knew  what this city was like that day. People were walking over bridges. They  were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying.  Their family members were dead. And these people ran to Ground Zero to  stave people's lives. And we're not going to even give them medicine for  the illnesses that they got down there. It's disgusting. It's a national  disgrace. It's a shame. And everybody who voted against it should have to  stand up and account for himself or herself. Is anybody going to hold them  accountable? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you just did. </p><p>SMITH: Well, I'm not really in a position to do that. I mean I think I just  kind of went out there and said what the truth is and I feel like -- I feel  like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people.  There was no warning label on Ground Zero on 9/11 \"these substances will  kill you.\" And even if there had been, they'd have gone anyway. They just  need a little bit of help. It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of  things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax  refunds than we do doing anything for those people, don't we? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: So that's Shep Smith, Fox News. So the next time one of you want to  tell me about Fox News, I'm going to tell you about Shep Smith. That's what  I'm talking about. </p><p>Now, I didn't see Diane Sawyer and I didn't see that coward Brian Williams  or that little rodent over there. Well, we don't need to get into name  calling, Don. </p><p>MCCORD: Well, why are we? </p><p>IMUS: Or the very lovely Katie Couric --</p><p>MCCORD: Better.</p><p>IMUS: Or the -- well, not so courageous, that's a better way to put it,  Brian Williams. Did you ever -- did -- what -- did they say anything about  it? </p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, of course not. Were they railing about it at MSNBC? Well,  of course not. So that's what I'm talking about. So if you're the John  Thunes of the world and you turn that on -- it's on all the time here -- if  you see Shep Smith calling you out -- </p><p>MCCORD: Then, wait a minute. </p><p>IMUS: By the way, Chris Wallace in there sucking his thumb, thinking, oh, I  hope I don't get in trouble. </p><p>MCGUIRK: No, he brought it up on the Sunday show. </p><p>IMUS: Anyway, quarter after the hour. Time for a little sports now. </p><p>MCGUIRK: And the (INAUDIBLE) Democrats controlled Congress for two years,  with the Democratic president, and they waited till the lame duck session  to try to pass this (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>IMUS: Save all that for next time you're on Hannity. </p><p>It's 16 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I'll get an  e-mail from Hannity. </p><p>Did we do your business report yet, Connell? </p><p>MCSHANE: Not yet, I don't think. </p><p>IMUS: No, OK, we can do it in a minute. Don't worry about it. </p><p>MCSHANE: OK, I'm not. </p><p>IMUS: Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf. </p><p>Good morning, Warner. </p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Good morning, I-man. </p><p>Well, they completed the playoff picture last night. The lonely Seattle  Seahawks finishing 7-9, beat the Rams 16-6. They win the NFC West. Change  the rule, man. Forget winning the division, you can't have a losing record.  You're out. Replaced by the non-playoff team with the best record. The  Giants, by the way, will bring back Tom Coughlin. </p><p>Packers win their final wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3.. That  eliminated the Giants. The Colts win the AFC South, beat the Titans 23-20.  Adam Vinatieri's 43 yard field goal, last play of the game. Although the  Colts didn't know it, because they didn't show the score on the scoreboard.  They had actually won it minutes earlier when the Jags lost. The Steelers  win the AFC North. The Falcons win the NFC South.</p><p>And the NBA last night, in Los Angeles, before a rare booing crowd, they  booed the Lakers at the Staples Center. The Lakers lost to the Grizzlies by  19 points, 104-85. And after the game, Phil Jackson blamed it on Kobe  Bryant. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, early in the  third quarter on some stupid plays, and, you know, Kobe has to screw up  the, you know, game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one. That  takes the rest of the guys out. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Wow, Kobe screwing up the game. </p><p>IMUS: So Kobe was going one-on-one with some other member of the other  team, obviously, duh, right? </p><p>MCGUIRK: No, one of the members of -- one of the audience members. </p><p>IMUS: Well, speaking of the audience, here's what's wrong with the Lakers. </p><p>WOLF: What is it? </p><p>IMUS: It's one thing if Jack Nicholson wants to have floor seats -- I mean,  I think he deserves those. He's earned them, don't you think? </p><p>WOLF: Yes. </p><p>IMUS: But not Larry David. Not some sit -- not some sitcom dope. </p><p>MCCORD: What's he done? </p><p>IMUS: Well, should be sitting there -- I mean you just can't. </p><p>WOLF: Yes, work it --</p><p>IMUS: And yet I watched the game on Christmas Day, the brain did -- of  course I'm furiously e-mailing Breen my comments as he's trying to do the  game, which I'm sure -- and he sometimes answers them, by the way.</p><p>WOLF: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: But Larry David? How possibly could Larry David -- who gave Larry  David a floor seat? That's a disgrace. </p><p>MCGUIRK: He only created \"Seinfeld.\" Come on. </p><p>IMUS: What does \"Seinfeld\" have do with it. Seinfeld must have something to  do with it. </p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, a little bit. Larry David's a genius? </p><p>IMUS: Still shouldn't be sitting on -- he's a sitcom dope. He shouldn't be  sitting on the floor. </p><p>MCGUIRK: Get him out.</p><p>IMUS: He just don't. He may be a genius, but he shouldn't be sitting on the  floor. This is the guy you were screaming about he peed on Jesus.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we all stray.</p><p>IMUS: He's -- he is a genius or you -- or he peed on Jesus. You can't pee  on Jesus, can you? </p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No. </p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: And be a genius.</p><p>IMUS: Huh? </p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The two are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>IMUS: It doesn't take a genius to pee on Jesus. It takes 12 -- well, it  takes probably a drunk or, you know --</p><p>MCGUIRK: The fact that he got away with it, that was so offensive. </p><p>IMUS: Yes. </p><p>Anyway, 19 after the hour. </p><p>So, were you finished with sports, Warner? </p><p>WOLF: His third sack of the game. </p><p>IMUS: OK. Time for a little business news and here with that is Connell  McShane.</p><p>Good morning, Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Just a few quick headlines for you this morning. The market is up again  after an 11 percent gain for the Dow in 2010. And the 17 percent rise for  the Nasdaq in 2010. The futures are way up this morning. Maybe some  optimism about economic data. We had plenty of it this week. Construction  spending and manufacturing today. The big retail reports out for the month  of December on Thursday and the jobs report for the month of December on  Friday. </p><p>So that is there, plus the report, I-man, in \"The New York Times\" that we  talked about earlier that Facebook has received an investment of $500  million from Goldman Sachs, according to \"The Times,\" which values Facebook  at $50 billion. </p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning here on the  IMUS IN THE MORNING program. And then Dagen McDowell, who will be coming up  in a few minutes. She and Connell do their very own show at 11:00 a.m. on  the Fox Business Network. </p><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour. Here's one of Mary Matalin's five favorite  songs.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: Well, let me tell you about Lindamood-Bell. You know what, the lady  who runs Lindamood-Bell grew up on a cattle ranch. Old Nancy. Did you know  that? I want to share with you the success story from the Lindamood-Bell  learning processes. This is from a parent with an eight-year-old son  diagnosed with autism. Here's the letter. </p><p>\"David was diagnosed with autism and struggled with socializing, expressive  language, critical thinking, comprehension. David started with an  assessment at Lindamood-Bell and did an eight week intensive program. The  staff at Lindamood-Bell was sensitive to our concerns and needs and gave us  constant feedback. David has improved tremendously. Before Lindamood-Bell,  his overall comprehension was at the ninth percentile. After his retest at  Lindamood-Bell, he was at the 70 percentile.\" That's unbelievable, isn't  it? Call them at 800-300-1818 or go online at lindamoodbell.com. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Johnson &amp; Johnson, today, is going to announce a  powerful new cancer test that it wants to put on the market. It's a blood  test. It is billed as being able to spot a single cancer cell out of a  billion healthy cells. J&amp;J teaming up with scientists who invented the test  to make it cheaper and better. And their hope is that the blood test can  take the place of more invasive cancer tests. </p><p>Stocks starting off the new year with gains. The data out of China is being  seen as a positive for the market. It showed manufacturing slip for the  first time in five months, but what's that doing is it's easing some  inflation concerns. And Europe has been up all morning long. London closed  today because of the New Year's holiday. But Paris up 2 percent. Germany up  1.25 percent.</p><p>Here in the U.S., stock index futures indicating a higher open a little  over an hour from now on Wall Street with the Dow futures up by 90 points.  And a quick look at commodities as well. The oil price is around $92 a  barrel all morning. And gold, after being lower, is now up over $1 at  $1,422 per ounce.</p><p>All right. The IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right now here at the  Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper. </p><p>IMUS: All right. Twenty-six after the hour as we continue to get behind  here. But it's -- we're getting everything in, so that's more important  than anything else, I guess. So, it's time for a little business news  again. Here with that, Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>From getting behind to going up, gas prices. The national average for  regular unleaded is already $3.07 a gallon. It's going to head back to near  $4 a gallon by the spring according to many experts. It should be the  second highest year on record in terms of prices. Let's hope it doesn't get  back to $4.11 a gallon. That was a record hit in the summer of '08.</p><p>And, by the way, if you're interested in how Shania Twain's life develops  with this new husband, who's the ex-husband of the woman who broke up  Shania's marriage, she's going to have her own show on the new Oprah  Winfrey Network later this year, I believe, called \"Why Not?\" with Shania  Twain. </p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. So you can keep --</p><p>IMUS: Do you have a picture of the husband? Because she's cute. </p><p>MCDOWELL: He's cute. Do we have a picture of their wedding? </p><p>IMUS: No, of him?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, well, of him.</p><p>IMUS: You were telling me how hot he was.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's got -- well, he's got curly -- he's got curly hair and it  kind of has a little bit of a mullet if memory serves. He's pretty cute.  He's better looking than Mutt Lange, I'll put it that way. </p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash deal on that, isn't it? </p><p>MCCORD: Oh, brother.</p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash trailer park situation. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but you get to watch it for free, though, when you watch it  on the TV. That's -- or you can come over to my house, which I don't think  you want to do. </p><p>IMUS: Yes. How did that go, by the way, over the holidays at your house? </p><p>MCDOWELL: It was all right. I got trapped in the house with six adults,  three kids and three dogs. And one of the dogs, being a four month old  border collie puppy. So that was a good time. </p><p>IMUS: Who were the adults? </p><p>MCDOWELL: Mama, daddy, brother, his wife, Jonas and me. If you could call  us all adults. </p><p>IMUS: How is your brother's wife? How do you get along with her? </p><p>MCDOWELL: I adore her. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, you do? </p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. We get along good. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, that's too bad. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Why? </p><p>IMUS: Well, we'd just like a little friction and stuff going on. So there  wasn't any animosity that bubbled to the surface there or any long held  resentments or anything?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I wasn't happy with -- no, I wasn't happy with my Christmas  gifts from Jonas. But other than that. </p><p>IMUS: What did he get you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Underwear that he bought -- I know he bought on sale because I  saw it on sale on the Internet. And a computer, a laptop, which is just  business. I didn't want something business related. And I wanted underwear  that fit that was nicer than what he gave me. So, I was mad. At least I  didn't get those pajama jeans. I mean I can look on the bright side. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, he didn't get you like them big ole granny drawers, did he?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some were, yes, large in size. Some, too small. There was no  happy medium.</p><p>IMUS: He didn't' get --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was no happy medium. They were either to small and  uncomfortable or they were too big and loose. </p><p>IMUS: So he didn't go the Victoria's Secret thong deal? </p><p>MCDOWELL: No, he went on the Internet to one of these private sales sites  and bought drawers on sale. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, he got you some -- he got you some of those Hanes -- big old --  them Hanes big beefy drawers. </p><p>MCCORD: Off of eBay. </p><p>IMUS: All right, time for a Bernard McGuirk briefing, a \"Bernie Briefing,\"  sponsored by -- these big old beefy drawers. </p><p>MCCORD: That ain't right. </p><p>IMUS: Sponsored by P.C. Richard &amp; Son. A hundred and one years they've got  it going on. Still going on. </p><p>What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, chief, on the \"New Year's Rocking Eve\" fright night, the TV  shows, I confess I was one of the losers who was up at midnight watching.  And I was watching Dick Clark --</p><p>IMUS: No, don't do this.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And -- well, no, no, this is -- this is a big story. There are  competing, differing opinions as to whether or not Dick Clark should still  be out there.  Some people say it's an inspiration, but --   </p><p>IMUS:  No, no.  It's too humiliating for him.  Whoever is around him  shouldn't let him do this.  It's terrible.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DICK CLARK, BROADCASTER:  But don't you go anywhere. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Where did that come from?  </p><p>IMUS:  I didn't hear the sound.  There's no point in playing it.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  We have audio here.  Lou will play it.</p><p>Here, Lou.  Go ahead.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARK:  Thank you, Ryan, very much.  Now, take a look at all the people up  on Broadway.  I don't know how people pull off this party year after year,  but they do a whale of a job.  And tonight it will be bigger and better  than ever.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Again, some people say that's inspiring, and some people say it's  out of place.  But in any case, he won the night far and away.  He was the  most watched show that night of all the broadcast and cable New Year's Eve  shows.  And God bless poor old Dick Clark.  </p><p>IMUS:  You bastard.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  What?  </p><p>IMUS:  You evil bastard.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Why?  </p><p>IMUS:  You just can't -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Well, he shouldn't be going on.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I didn't put him on ABC.  </p><p>IMUS:  No, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  I think he should be on.  I think he is an inspiration.</p><p>IMUS:  Put him on Fox.  No.  No.  </p><p>MCCORD:  He was just presenting the controversy. </p><p>IMUS:  You put him on ABC.  You can't be.  You can't do that.  It's  horrible.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, I happen to disagree.  I think it's a good thing.  I think  it's a nice thing.  And again, it inspires people who have been ill.  </p><p>My dad had a stroke, he came back from it.  It makes people say, yes, I can  do it.  </p><p>IMUS:  I don't know.  Here he is on -- who is that Ryan Seacrest?  Do you  have any sound on that, Big Foot.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  We have a little -- we have sound.  Lou and I have some sound  from Ryan Seacrest just before --   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, there's Dick and -- Big Foot, we can't hear any sound on this.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Maybe he doesn't want to.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN SEACREST:  Sorry.  Sorry, not my fault.  </p><p>CLARK:  Happy New Year.</p><p>SEACREST:  Happy New Year.  Great job.  </p><p>CLARK:  Thank you, Ryan.  Thank you.</p><p>SEACREST:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>Dick Clark, ladies and gentlemen.  </p><p>Well, we are inside, and it's even warmer in here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  That's a nice thing.  The man's been through hell and back.  Way  to kick off the new year.  </p><p>Charles, push him.  Is he all right?  </p><p>MCCORD:  He's all right, but he's --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Looking to the future.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)   </p><p>IMUS:  You son of a bitch! </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Tom goes for the easy joke.  </p><p>IMUS:  Call that funny, Charles?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good.  Now everybody is -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Everybody is waiting to see who is going to say it.  </p><p>IMUS:  Tom.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, Tom, have you got that clip?  Lou?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'll he come up here and I'll find you.  Are you coming  down here?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I just got to e-mail from Neil Cavuto.  </p><p>IMUS:  That's not funny.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was down at the ranch last we week.  </p><p>MCCORD:  This is not -- stop.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's not funny.  It's not funny, no.  </p><p>MCCORD:  This is not good.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's not funny, Bernard.  It's not.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Look, God bless Dick Clark, is all I'm saying.  </p><p>MCCORD:  There is an is inspirational story.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.  That Ryan Seacrest, too.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  No.</p><p>MCCORD:  You've got to stop.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, God.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  \"Blonde on Blonde\" is coming up tomorrow.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>IMUS:  That's just horrible.  God.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Imus at night -- be there.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why do they do that?  That's horrible.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why are they wheeling him out there?  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No, it's his show.  He's as lucid as they come.  He just can't  speak properly.  So why not?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's the way he's going to go out though.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  So what?  That's his choice.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, it's not.  </p><p>IMUS:  That's not right.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  It was a ratings winner for the night.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I don't think it had much to do -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let's go see how he is?</p><p>IMUS:  Do you?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Ryan Seacrest.  You had a bunch of great performers.  Kesha was  there.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, Ryan Seacrest, if you get down and you -- I mean, I like him,  but if you get down and you scrape the bottom of the show biz barrel,  that's where you find Ryan Seacrest.  I mean, he's on the E! Channel, for  God's sake.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  He's \"American Idol.\"  He's at the top of his game, that guys.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, whatever.  He's at the bottom of the barrel.   He may be at the  top of the game, but -- </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a business  update from the Fox Business Network.  Here's Connell McShane.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  And when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California  Congressman Darrell Issa getting a big promotion.  He'll become the  chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which basically means he'll be  the one or heading up the committee that oversees the government.</p><p>And appearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Issa telling Chris Wallace he's going  to target government spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  We have about $1.7 trillion worth of  regulatory costs already in the government.  If the president wants to  throw another $300 or $400 billion, what he's doing is taking it right out  of businesses, right out of employment, right out of competitiveness.  We  need to make sure we can compete. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings as  committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also  Medicare.  </p><p>Checking in on the markets here this morning for you, up all morning long.   And we are indicated higher on the futures by 85 points now on Dow futures.   It looks like a strong start to the new year coming on Wall Street in just  a little while.</p><p>It's the IMUS IN THE MORNING program that continues right now with a check  of the forecast.    </p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>IMUS:  Twenty minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program, on the radio all over the country, and on the Fox Business Network  all over the world.  Three new radio affiliates today --  WAUB, 1590, way  up there on the right-hand side of the dial where the dogs can listen, and  at 94.1 FM here in Auburn, New York.  </p><p>MCCORD:  But you can't.  </p><p>IMUS:  On WGBA, 1240 on the dial there in Geneva, New York, Finger Lakes  News Radio.  And KWKC, 1340 AM, in Abilene, Texas, Talk Radio 1340.  </p><p>Tomorrow, on this program, Tom Friedman.  Wednesday, \"Blonde on Blonde.\"  </p><p>Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, our old friend,  former assistant to the president, vice president, a bunch of other stuff,  Mary Matlin.  </p><p>Good morning, Ms. Matalin.  </p><p>MARY MATALIN, FMR. ASSISTANT TO VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY:  Here, kitty kitty.   Hey.  Good morning.  Happy New Year.  </p><p>IMUS:  Are you calling the cat?  </p><p>MATALIN:  Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty.  Here, kitty kitty.  She was trapped  outside and was about to unleash the dogs of my hell, my mini dachshund.  I  said, \"Kitty.\"  </p><p>It irritates I-Man.  He doesn't want to hear you.</p><p>IMUS:  I like cats and dogs.  What's your cat's name?  </p><p>MATALIN:  Witchy.  She has one green eye and one blue eye.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why are you out of breath?  </p><p>MATALIN:  Because I had to move the chair, open the shades, and open the  window from the bottom up, while I was holding the phone in my ear.  And  I'm old now.  </p><p>IMUS:  Did you -- what did you do New Year's Eve?  </p><p>MATALIN:  Made black eyed peas and cabbage and listened to WWOZ and had a  glass of wine by myself.  </p><p>IMUS:  Where was James?  </p><p>MATALIN:  Was it after 9:00?  If it's after 9:00, he's in bed.  </p><p>IMUS:  So did you stay up and watch the ball come down?  </p><p>MATALIN:  I listened to WWOZ, which is the best jazz in the world -- Irvin  Mayfield, jazz play club on Bourbon Street live.  </p><p>IMUS:  Radio?  </p><p>MATALIN:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, you didn't make that clear.  </p><p>MATALIN:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I should know everybody doesn't  know WWOZ.  But if you don't, you can get it live streaming.  It's the best  jazz.  </p><p>IMUS:  Because Bernie just played a cut of Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking  Eve in which Mr. Clark was on.  And, of course, he's had a stroke some  years ago.  </p><p>MATALIN:  Yes, I saw it on, and I have to take Bernie's side as I do on  most things on this.  I thought it was an inspiration.  </p><p>IMUS:  You thought it was an inspiration?  </p><p>MATALIN:  I guess you don't.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, an inspiration to who?  </p><p>MATALIN:  Just what Bernie said.  If you've been -- if you've come back  from something that -- a disease that people -- or suffered from something  that would normally render you hidden away for whatever reason, and you can  come back, that's an inspiration to others who are similarly afflicted.   Heart disease or cancer or anything, you can talk about it and show people  that everything is workable, and life is worth living.  </p><p>IMUS:  Does she have a point, Charles?  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes, and a point that it need not be in all cases the end and -- </p><p>MATALIN:  Or it can be a different reality.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Exactly.  And Mr. Clark is a textbook example of that.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, but my problem with it is --   </p><p>MCCORD:  What?  </p><p>IMUS:  -- is that whenever it gets played on this program, and the reason  that it's intended to be a source of amusement, that's the problem.  </p><p>MATALIN:  So it's not -- so, as always, it's always about you.  This is  about what, is that you're saying?  You didn't like it?  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, guess what?  It's 2011.  Suddenly, it's not going to be about  me this year.  Well, of course.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MATALIN:  This is your new New Year's resolution?  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, no, but I don't know -- </p><p>MCCORD:  It could be about him a few years down the road.  </p><p>IMUS:  I just don't -- I don't know.  I feel bad for the guy and I don't  think it's funny.  I mean, you can make it funny.  They did make it funny,  Bernie and Lou, of course, and Charles.  </p><p>MCCORD:  You made it funny.  </p><p>IMUS:  Huh?  </p><p>MATALIN:  You made it funny.  Bernie made it about -- </p><p>IMUS:  Then they made it about me, a window to the future.  </p><p>MATALIN:  You invited it.  You invited it by being so -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  I don't invite the ridicule that I constantly get on this program.  </p><p>MATALIN:  Oh.  </p><p>IMUS:  Anyway.  </p><p>MATALIN:  OK.  </p><p>IMUS:  So the Bush tax cuts, I guess, have been extended.  What does that  mean?  </p><p>MATALIN:  That means these rich bastards who don't need them, you know, are  now going to get them.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, why do you think the president did it?  </p><p>MATALIN: Because he's -- he just wanted to screw his own guys.  </p><p>IMUS:  Really?  </p><p>MATALIN:  No.  None of the above.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well what then?  </p><p>MATALIN:  It's -- I think we -- he did it because he didn't want to be  blamed for not doing it.  And Larry Summers and everybody else came out and  said that reality, which will give us a double-dip recession if taxes are  affected in a recession.  </p><p>IMUS:  So you think it's going to have an impact on the economy?  </p><p>MATALIN:  I think the opposite would have had a severe impact, a better  impact -- </p><p>IMUS:  That's not what I asked you. </p><p>MATALIN:  Well, these aren't yes or no questions.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, answer it as best as you can, as you're capable of.</p><p>MATALIN:  I'm answering it.</p><p>IMUS:  By opening the window and choking your cat.  </p><p>MATALIN:  One of the cats, the one that still has a tail.  </p><p>A better package would have been to have no spending increases and leave  the tax structure as it was, and leave the estate tax where it was so  people don't make decisions upon -- about their final days based on their  tax situation, which I think is immoral.  That would have been the better  package, but that's not what happened because politics -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>IMUS:  Well, the rap we were hearing, Mary Matalin, is that if we gave the  tax cuts to all these rich bastards and these other folks, that that would  all -- that they would then invest in the economy and hire more people and  all that sort of thing.  </p><p>So, my question is, do you think that's going to happen?  </p><p>MATALIN:  No, that's the rap that -- that's -- the case for tax cuts as a  stimulative economic policy do not -- </p><p>IMUS:  I like that phrase.</p><p>MATALIN:  -- go to those tax cuts.  That was maintaining a tax rate, the  changing of which would have exacerbated recessionary problems.</p><p>Stimulative taxes -- not all tax cuts are created equal -- would have been  further reductions of the top rates, a reduction in the corporate tax rate,  eradication of corporate taxes loopholes and such, and tax reform, which  the president's talking about.  That's stimulative tax policy, not just  keeping the same rates.  So that's one of their canards.</p><p>And what would be most stimulative now is to continue to reduce or make  some effort to stop spending and roll back the debt, starting with health  care.  So that will be the plan, and I hope they get some of it done.  </p><p>IMUS:  And your scummy Republican friends were shamed into caving in on the  9/11 Responders Bill. </p><p>MATALIN:  In response to scummy liberals, who -- </p><p>IMUS:  And inspired quite a bit by Shep Smith (ph).</p><p>MATALIN:  -- let it sit there for years and did nothing about it, and wait  until it's Christmas Eve and lard it up.  Yes, it should have been passed.    It should have been passed two years earlier.  There shouldn't have been  anybody who had any problem getting any health care at any time from 9/11  on.  </p><p>IMUS:  By the way, that's a very good point.  </p><p>Hey, how are things in New Orleans?  You live there now, right?  </p><p>MATALIN:  We're going on year three.  </p><p>IMUS:  Huh?  </p><p>MATALIN:  This is our third year here.  It's wonderful.  </p><p>IMUS:  Who is the new mayor there?  </p><p>MATALIN:  He's spectacular.  </p><p>IMUS:  Who is it -- huh?  </p><p>MATALIN:  He's going to be up in New York.  He comes a lot.  He's got a new  police chief.  </p><p>IMUS:  What is his name?  </p><p>Oh, I'm sorry.  Mitch Landrieu, Mayor Mitch.  </p><p>IMUS:  Has he been indicted yet?  </p><p>MATALIN:  We used to -- half the state was under water and other half was  under indictment.  But we're not like that now.  We're all cleaned up now.  </p><p>IMUS:  Happy New Year to you, the kids, him.</p><p>MATALIN:  And Happy New Year.  You'll never be  -- you'll always be you,  Imus.  You'll just always be you.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, let's hope so.  Thank you.  </p><p>MATALIN:  Happy New Year.  </p><p>IMUS:  Mary Matalin.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  Here is the \"Fox Business Minute.\"  </p><p>Many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day.   There was a glitch in the phone's alarm clock feature.  Users who set their  alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't go off when 2011 arrived.  </p><p>An Apple spokesperson says the fix is in the works and all alarms will work  properly starting today.  But users in Europe and Asia saying the problem  has not yet been fixed.  </p><p>Vizio, maker of inexpensive flat-TV screens, is looking to expand.  \"The  Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell  phones and tablet computers, and those two products, the Via Phone and the  Via Tablet, will be introduced this summer.  The announcement comes just  days ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show taking place this week in Las  Vegas.  </p><p>And \"Little Fockers\" holding on to the top spot at the weekend box office.   That movie bringing in just over $26 million this past weekend, so it's  total now $103 million.</p><p>With no other movies -- no new movies being released over the New Year's  weekend, the rest of the lineup looks similar to last week.  The number two  and three movies are still \"True Grit\" and \"TRON Legacy.\"</p><p>As for the futures this morning, they have been higher all morning long,  indicating the Wall Street open will be to the upside, as Dow futures are  up by 83 points.</p><p>And IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, \"The Power to  Prosper.\"  </p><p>IMUS:  Coming up on five minutes to the hour.  This portion of the IMUS IN  THE MORNING program sponsored by State Bank.  Put your business in a better  state.  Visit statebankofli.com.</p><p>Well, coming up next hour, Jeff Greenfield.  We'll talk to him, CBS News.   And then Stuart Varney.</p><p>Is Stuart here today, Connell?  Do you know?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I think he would be, yes.  Back to full strength.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, he is.  He's here.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, he is?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, that's unusual, because ordinarily he would stretch one of  these New Year's deals into an extra week's vacation, but apparently he's  not done that.</p><p>Gangsta Mickey is here, and so is Charles Rangel, neither of whom have been  on this morning, but they will get on coming up.  </p><p>It's five minutes now until the hour.     </p><p>IMUS:  Why are you looking at me -- with your mouth hanging open like a $2  suitcase?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Huh?</p><p>IMUS:  Made you look -- huh?  What's the matter?  </p><p>POWELL:  No, it's just another day at the home.  That's what it is.  Just  dropping my fork.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes, that's not good.  </p><p>Hi, dude.</p><p>IMUS:  What?  </p><p>MCCORD:  When you start dropping your utensils.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, no.  I wasn't eating, you idiot.  </p><p>POWELL:  Well, you freaked out about it though.  It's like, \"Oh, my fork.\"  </p><p>IMUS:  I dropped it because I have this tea, and they have hunks of lemon  in it.  And I eat the lemon.  </p><p>POWELL:  Sucking on a lemon.</p><p>MCCORD:  Eat the lemon, baby.</p><p>IMUS:  That's what I had for breakfast.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Eat the worm.  </p><p>POWELL:  So that's what's putting on all those pounds, those lemons and the  condiment sandwiches?  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCCORD:  You're going to have to cut out those lemon wedges.  Those lemon  wedges are killing you, I-Dude.</p><p>IMUS:  Ballooned up to 153 pounds.  </p><p>POWELL:  Yes, less tomato in your sandwich.  Maybe just one slice of onion.  </p><p>IMUS:  I'm not happy with either one of you bastards.  Got to get some new  blood in here.  </p><p>BARTLETT:  Why don't you do that?</p><p>IMUS:  Huh?</p><p>BARTLETT:  Why don't you do that?  And let me know how that works out for  you.  </p><p>IMUS:  Get old Cara (ph) to call, see what she is he' doing.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTLETT:  Yes, she'll commute back and forth from L.A.  </p><p>IMUS:  Did you tell me her new boyfriend died?  </p><p>BARTLETT:  Yes.</p><p>POWELL:  This is a boyfriend or girlfriend?</p><p>BARTLETT:  Yes, it's -- I don't know if -- obviously not the one she's  dating now.  </p><p>(REPEAT PACKAGE)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC.

I went to the Jets game yesterday, they won, 38-7. But you know that already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS: Yes, I don't care about the Jets game because they were already in the playoffs. So I don't care about the Seattle Seahawks and the Rams people, but I'll find out apparently from Warner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCSHANE: So one of them with - record made the playoffs. I'm being told in my ear, you want to know who won now or no?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS: No, let me find out from Warner, because, Warner likes to tell me stuff like that.</p><p>MCSHANE: It is Warner's job.</p><p>IMUS: Santa brought us a goofy tie? Is that what happened?</p><p>MCSHANE: No, I had that one already, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: The funny tie, under the tree.</p><p>MCSHANE: So you got two weeks off and that is the best you could come up with.</p><p>IMUS: That's all I could come up with.</p><p>MCSHANE: You sound great, by the way. How this is voice, good?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't have throat cancer, they tell me, but I do have -- pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCSHANE: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Yes --and, like if you had a colonoscopy and they find this -- remove them, so, these are -- they have to take them off with a laser here in a couple of weeks, and this is way too much information.</p><p>MCSHANE: I actually care. I told you, I care.</p><p>IMUS: I'll be fine.</p><p>MCSHANE: You will be OK, that is the main point.</p><p>IMUS: Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, and Mary Matalin coming up this morning. Three new radio affiliates - have you even seen that guy who does the red eye thing here on Fox.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Is he any good.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, sure. It's fine. I don't watch it. It is on in the middle of the night, but a lot of people like it.</p><p>IMUS: I saw him on the news with <person><nameText>Megyn Kelly </nameText></person>and -- too happy to suit me, but he seemed funny.</p><p>MCSHANE: He is pretty funny.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder if we should have him on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Sure, why not. Give it a try.</p><p>IMUS: Is he any good? He is good. You are saying that because we're on - - on TV, here, aren't you.</p><p>MCSHANE: That is why, yes.</p><p>IMUS: What is going on with business -- how this is Facebook deal, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, $50 billion valuation on Facebook. It's no joke right there.</p><p>IMUS: Please.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's what Goldman thinks it's worth anyway. I will get to that in a second, but thank you, I-man and good morning. First, let's bring up the markets and look up some numbers here because stocks are starting off the new week and the New Year with some gains here globally.</p><p>China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and if anything that's actually easing concerns about inflation and the Chinese market at the bottom screen is up 1-3/4 percent overnight.</p><p>Markets in Hong Kong and South Korea are also up, and Japan has not resumed trading yet in the New Year. Over in Europe, London is closed today for the New Year's holiday, but Paris and Frankfurt are both up significantly, Paris by more than 2 percent and our futures indicating a higher open on Wall Street as well up by 76 points on Dow futures, pretty good numbers.</p><p>Now as for the major indexes and how they fared in 2010, the Dow gained 11 percent, S&amp;P 13 percent, the Nasdaq the best performer of the bunch, 17 percent gain.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on more debt national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion ceiling and the White House Council of Economic Advisors, Chairman Austin Goolsbee on ABC's \"This Week\" saying it's crucial the ceiling is raised.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUSTIN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: This is not a game, you know, the debt ceiling is not something to toy with. That is the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that is the -- essentially defaulting on our obligations, which is unprecedented in American history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree it does need to be raised but, many of them are also saying they will not go along with it unless they get promises to change Washington's spending habits and argue there is no point in having a debt ceiling if they raise it every time the national debt gets close. Now here's the story that the I-man was referring to a moment ago.</p><p>Goldman Sachs investing $450 million in Facebook, according to the \"New York Times.\" A Russian company also buying $50 million worth of Facebook's stock. \"The Times\" says these deals value Facebook at $50 billion. Now, as we have reported the FCC now looking into secondary market trading at Facebook's privately held shares.</p><p>Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its web site, the latest development in the conflict between airlines and online travel agencies, since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says Expedia intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results. American is looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own web site and every effort to save money. Expedia says the move will only cost them ticket sales and believes Americans' efforts are bad for travellers.</p><p>All right, let's take a live look now at commodities this morning. The oil price is above $92 per barrel and gold is down by a dollar per ounce.</p><p>Coming up, a little bit later on in the hour, Bo Dietl will be the I-man's guest as IMUS IN THE MORNING does get started, right now, Fox Business, power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: Warner, who won the football game last night?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Seahawks, man, they finished 7-9. Win the division and are in the playoffs.</p><p>IMUS: So the giants, who are 10-6, they are not in the playoffs.</p><p>WOLF: You got it. No, you have to change the rule.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN: That is crazy.</p><p>WOLF: Absurd, yes.</p><p>IMUS: I will whip somebody's butt over there -- Charles and I.</p><p>WOLF: Now you're talking.</p><p>IMUS: Charles and me, yes. And, I get my grammar screwed up. Happy New Year, everybody.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Shucks.</p><p>IMUS: Bring you up on my medical, last time --</p><p>MCCORD: Let's have the latest.</p><p>IMUS: I'm had a biopsy -- let me say this about Mt. Sinai. It is a great hospital. You know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and Cornell and Mt. Sinai is a great hospital. The nurses are unbelievable and Dr. Peekaboo Woo, and Dr. Allen Reid, the anesthesiologist, are fabulous.</p><p>MCCORD: Good.</p><p>IMUS: They all did a great job and I apparently do not have throat cancer. What I have are these pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCCORD: Dysplasia, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Charles knows more about what I have than I do.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, they have to remove them with a laser, and, at a high level, and they would develop into --</p><p>MCCORD: Get rid of them, that is why we get rid of them.</p><p>IMUS: And you know how I got them? Smoking.</p><p>MCCORD: Really? That is what they say? OK.</p><p>IMUS: I haven't smoked for 15 years, but -</p><p>MCCORD: Listen to that, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, so I'm fine, Bo Dietl, Jerry Greenfield.</p><p>MCCORD: That's great news to start the new year.</p><p>IMUS: Bo Dietl, still have prostate cancer but, I think I do. I'm not sure anymore whether I do or not.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, may have defeated that.</p><p>IMUS: And, I came back from the ranch on Saturday.</p><p>MCCORDs: That's 700 miles an hour with the freaking tail wind.</p><p>IMUS: What a great vacation. It's 10 degrees. We have to go out there, because we run the place. It's 10 degrees -- the wind - there's not a ski resort.</p><p>MCCORD: How about that wind?</p><p>IMUS: The wind blows and I'm not exaggerating, 60 miles an hour. Anyway, Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, Mary Matalin, coming up and we have three new radio affiliates, and when I put my glasses on I'll tell you who they are.</p><p>I'm not going to do it now and, ratings came out in New York and for people -- the ratings are broken down, all kinds of demographics and I don't believe in them but I think they give you a rough idea, of you know - - I mean, you can -- like lit-fm or one of those -- hot 97 or one of these. Whoever these stations are, that do well.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And if it is consistent over a long period of time, like when stern was on terrestrial radio, you knew he was number one, and had been on a long time, a trend that remains supported, consistency.</p><p>IMUS: So, but on these 12-plus numbers they measure people by demographics like break it down to 12 to 18, 25-54, 18-34, it is ridiculous. Men, women, all of this and there's another one they do and it is just everybody who is 12 years of age or older. And, this program, the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, is the number 2 program in New York.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get out of town!</p><p>MCCORD: Shut the front door!</p><p>IMUS: Now, of course, I told Connell and Dagen that part of that, because, they are about the only new thing we have done here, other than I have a better attitude. They were partly responsible for that and then I got to thinking about it and if it weren't for them, we could have easily been number one.</p><p>MCCORD: Number one. Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'm sorry, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Which is the reason, when I got fired, and got the job at ABC I insisted on bringing Lou and Bernie, and Charles and everybody else, because, I knew without them, I would just be -- if it weren't for them, I would be on some station, in Jersey with Uncle Floyd.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Uncle Floyd!</p><p>IMUS: I'd be on Sirius satellite radio. Mel likes me, to give me a job for 50 grand a year. And sit there -</p><p>RUFINO: At UHF --</p><p>IMUS: The I-man's blues channel, Blues and alternate country on Sirius. But, as it is -- so the show -- I've never been number 2, ever. Not back when --</p><p>MCCORD: Your best ratings.</p><p>IMUS: Not back when I was. So I'm happy about that and it is a great program. It's a better program than it ever was. Having very little to do -- not being self-effacing, having we little to do with me, Bernie, Lou, they are all great. Time for a little news and here with that is Chuck McCord. Good morning, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Good morning, I-man. Speaking of the weather, the main highway between southern and central California, shut down, both directions, blowing snow and ice from another big storm. The grapevine area of I-5 closed indefinitely, winds gusting to -- reminded me, winds, gusting to 90 miles per hour in mountain areas, and still accumulating at elevations, as low as just 1,500 feet.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>says he is honored to sign the bill to provide aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks, and first responders, all of whom --</p><p>IMUS: You know --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: \"The New York Times\" did an article about the stuff that Jon Stewart, who as you know, I like, stuff Jon Stewart did about the 9/11 bill.</p><p>MCCORD: I saw it and all of that.</p><p>IMUS: And wondering if Jon Stewart was under Edward R. Murrow, which I would hope even Jon Stewart would be embarrassed about. But perhaps he's not or we don't know because I don't know him, but I would suggest -- and it has nothing do with anything, but until Shep Smith went on the rant that he went on, as a result of seeing Jon Stewart's show, which Shep said he did, and -- hey, big foot --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS: There's the famous rap that Shep Smith did, he was talking to somebody, and he referenced Jon Stewart, and he had seen the Jon Stewart show apparently the night before, there's got to be a way to find that, right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we'll find it.</p><p>IMUS: He was -- first of all, they are both terrific, both Stewart and Shep Smith is magnificent. Few better, in fact -- I don't know if there is anybody better, but it was a respond -- did you site, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. I did --</p><p>IMUS: Am I right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: On the money, a 100 percent.</p><p>IMUS: He was absolutely spectacular.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I happened to see that.</p><p>IMUS: And it seemed to me it was spontaneous.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Certainly seemed that way.</p><p>IMUS: And the boy seemed to be articulate to me and I have to play it for you. So I think that if you are a bunch of Republicans, I -- remember I had John Thune on and he was giving me some nonsense about -- didn't wanted to rush into it.</p><p>I didn't press him hard on that, not as much as I should have, and, you know, the -- I started to say to him, you know, don't want to rush into anything and, I hope we get it before all of these people die. So, people like Senator Thune, who I am no longer supporting for anything --</p><p>MCGUIRK: That may be premature. The Republicans -- they ended up saving $3 billion from that particular bill. That is what they were holding out for, eliminate --</p><p>IMUS: They weren't going to do it until they got shamed into it by Jon Stewart and by Shep Smith, I'm saying. And when Shep Smith attacked them, I'm sure they were thinking, that is our home boy there, at Fox.</p><p>I mean, I'm sure in their minds they are thinking if we lost Shep Smith we lost the country. You would expect Jon Stewart. I thought it was magnificent what he did, by the way, but you expect him to do what he did but you wouldn't expect Shep Smith to do what he did and if you lose him you lost everybody. I mean, I'm sure they are thinking that and go that the scared into passing it, didn't they, Bernie, talking about the money they saved, because you carry water for them.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's the fact. Chuck Schumer's bill was $7 billion and, the bill ended up being $4 billion and they saved --</p><p>IMUS: But they wouldn't have done anything, had there not been those two events, am I right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Perhaps, there's no way to conclusively prove that, but it sure seems that way.</p><p>IMUS: And let me ask you this, for everybody who thinks, Sarah Palin is a moron, and I would be one of them, would you would this country be any worse off today if she were president? Answer me that. Tell me. I'm waiting --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Checkmate for the I-man.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Because, at least -- think whatever you want to think about her, and think as I do, maybe, even. I don't know that I think she is a moron but she'd have sense enough to at least ask the people rather than get the same people bush had. But, this dope has been doing -- I mean, is he still on vacation in Hawaii, by the way?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. He comes back I think late today.</p><p>IMUS: And then, on I-25, out there in Santa Fe, when you go up to the ranch into Santa Fe, before you get into Santa Fe, there was a guy has a houses -- a lot of people have houses, a guy has a house, puts up these goofy billboards, a homemade billboard.</p><p>And, makes me laugh every time, they change and he's obviously a Hannity devotee or one of them and once he has had up there for a while. Where is the birth certificate? The hand lettered dopey sign, where is the birth certificate. Here's my question -- where is it? I mean, I'm not a -- obviously I'm not one of those --</p><p>MCGUIRK: A birther?</p><p>IMUS: Of course not. But, where is it?</p><p>MCCORD: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: Isn't the governor of ha walkers wasn't he screaming all about it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's claiming --</p><p>IMUS: Where is it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, let's see it. Clear this up.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, if the guy who is supporting the president -- which I would tend to support him, too, by the way. But I just say.</p><p>MCCORD: Let's resolve this.</p><p>IMUS: Why haven't we ever seen it or why don't they produce it, I can't answer that.</p><p>IMUS: It just adds fuel to these nuts.</p><p>MCCORD: Of course it does.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, 16 after the hour, taking way too much time with my nonsense, did you do any news at all? I interrupted you, 9/11 bill.</p><p>MCCORD: The James Zadroga bill has been signed by the president there in Hawaii, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Carly? Anymore coffee? She left --</p><p>MCCORD: I'll go get you some.</p><p>IMUS: She said what did Wyatt get for Christmas and I couldn't remember, horse stuff. She said, well does she still believe in Santa Claus?</p><p>MCCORD: And your reply.</p><p>IMUS: I said, well, I still believe in Santa Claus. Why wouldn't he? You know, 17 after the hour, Warner will do a little sports and before that, a quick business update, from Connell McShane here on the Fox Business Network and on the radio as well. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man. I'm talking about the markets here, as we start off the new trading year to the up side, after a pretty good year in 2010, stocks are up, globally, this morning.</p><p>News out of China that show the economy there slowing down a little bit, seen as a good sign because it eases concerns about inflation. Anyway, the futures are up. The European markets that are open are all up and the Asian markets were up, overnight as well.</p><p>Now, as for the year in 2010, the Dow ended the year, with a gain of 11 percent, the S&amp;P was up 13 percent, and the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, with a rise of nearly 17 percent, in 2010.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning and Dagen McDowell will be along -- you guys still have your show 11:00 a.m.</p><p>MCSHANE: So far, I believe, yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK, we'll start the year, brand new year with their show and they'll still do that and, that's good. Three new radio affiliates, WAUB at 1590 and 98.1 FM, out there in Auburn, New York and WGVA, at 1240, in Geneva, New York. Finger Lakes news radio, they call that.</p><p>And, KWKC, 1340, on the AM dial, down there in Abiline, Texas, talk radio 1340 and they joined the IMUS In The Morning line-up of stations around the country beginning this morning. Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man, well, completing the NFL picture, the playoffs last night, Seattle wins the NFC West with a record of 7-9. Come on!</p><p>IMUS: Who do they play, New Orleans?</p><p>WOLF: They'll play the Saints, yes, on Saturday. You have to change the rule here very quickly. You know, forget winning the division, if you have a losing record you are not in the playoffs. You take the team with the next best record, which would have been the Giants or the Bucks at 10-6.</p><p>Earlier, the Packers beat the Bears, 10-3. The Packers, 10-6, win the final wildcard. AFC, the Colts win the AFC South, on the 43 yard field goal, last play of the game, although the Colts had won it minutes earlier when the Jags were eliminated. Steelers, win the AFC. North Falcons win the NFC South so the playoffs are all set.</p><p>Packers, Eagles, in Philadelphia and Saints and Seahawks in Seattle, Jets and Colts in Indianapolis and the Ravens and Chiefs in Kansas City, yes, did you watch any of the bowl games?</p><p>WOLF: None.</p><p>IMUS: You know, I've watched them all, except I didn't pay any attention to them because they don't mean anything.</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: Including the one -- a week from tonight, Auburn and Oregon, you make me watch that.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I'll watch that.</p><p>IMUS: I won't be watching it. So, you'll watch that?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I will.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you be at Imus on Broadway, wouldn't you want to see that?</p><p>WOLF: A conflicting time.</p><p>IMUS: It is that night. It's already sold out, so, I mean -- I could try to get you in, but -- you don't express any interest, and every day you can go to some stupid movie and routinely get a half a chicken sandwich or tuna, whatever the hell you eat, a bottle of wine and go to the gym and, see a stupid movie, park in the handicapped zone and then, go to some idiot's Broadway musical or play of some sort and yet you won't come see Imus on Broadway. That is Monday night. You will watch the stupid game between Auburn and Oregon?</p><p>WOLF: No, forget that bowl game!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Too late.</p><p>IMUS: They got to get a playoff. They have playoffs, I mean, just stupid they don't have that. Don't you agree, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Absolutely, every baseball, basketball, college, hockey and -- everything, all have playoffs, except football.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking of Imus on Broadway, Colin Quinn, who stars in long story short, which I saw which is genius stuff, directed by Jerry Seinfeld, Colin now joined the line-up of Broadway musical shows that will perform Monday night at the Hard Rock.</p><p>MCCORD: Great.</p><p>IMUS: For the Imus cattle ranch for kids with cancer. And, the legendary emcee, which I exchanged e-mails throughout the past two weeks with, Dick Cavett is our emcee and that is worth going to see, to see him.</p><p>And I'll be there, just to introduce him. I wanted to thank our title sponsor, GMC and, one place you can go to look great, feel good and feel great and a GMC sales associate will show you the latest and greatest health and fitness products. Imus on Broadway, brought do you by GMC, which we're going to tape that -- probably -- are we going to tape it, big foot, or not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We'll tape it if you want.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know, I don't know, if you can or not. Anyway, Warner Wolf sports, sponsored by American-made Peerless Boilers and the new 96 percent efficient purifier series. You have any more sports, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: There's one more thing, listen to this, I-man the Grizzlies beat the slumping Lakers last night, in L.A., by 19 points. And after the game, Phil Jackson really took it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, behind early in the third quarter, on -- stupid plays, and, Kobe has to screw up, you know, the game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one, and takes the rest of the guys out --</p><p>WOLF: Wow. Kobe's screwing up the game. Phil Jackson. That is pretty harsh.</p><p>IMUS: You know who I have become a fan of now?</p><p>WOLF: Kevin Durant?</p><p>IMUS: No. The Miami Heat. I'll tell you why --</p><p>WOLF: Why, I-man?</p><p>RUFINO: Can't wait for this.</p><p>IMUS: Shut up, Lou! I'll tell you why.</p><p>WOLF: I wonder why.</p><p>RUFINO: Miami heat, good God!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Courageous.</p><p>WOLF: It has nothing to do with the fact they've won 17 out of the last 18 and 11 in a row.</p><p>IMUS: No. No. Because, something Magic Johnson said. He said, LeBron James is playing out of his mind, and he said it is time to stop booing him. He may -- you may be unhappy that he left Cleveland and the way he went about it but, you have to get over that. The guy is a great basketball player. So, they have got that together.</p><p>MCCORD: This is why?</p><p>IMUS: What's wrong?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why didn't he go to a team that didn't have a bunch of star players and elevate them as most great players do?</p><p>IMUS: Because that wasn't our plan. It's 24 after the hour. All right, Steven Stills is 66 years old today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Looking for an investment opportunity but not sure where to start? Check out Planet Fitness's -- what \"Inc. Magazine\" calls one of the fastest growing companies in America. Miami heat, God.</p><p>MCCORD: Pathetic.</p><p>IMUS: You shut up!

His five favorite songs, the Allman Brothers, \"One Way Out,\" \"Jungleland,\" Bruce Springsteen, \"Give me Shelter,\" The Stones, \"While my Guitar Gently Weeps,\" the Beatles, and, \"Landslide,\" Fleetwood Mac, not a horrible list.</p><p>MCCORD: Peta.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>RUFINO: Peta Griffin.</p><p>MCCORD: Peta.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: This song sucks.</p><p>IMUS: Time for little business news and here with all that, on the FOX Business Network and on the radio as well is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm good, welcome back, good to see you, sound great, look even better.</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All righty. So, iPhone, the Apple in its iPhone seemed to fall down on the job during the first two days of 2011 when the alarms that some iPhone owners set failed to go off, leaving folks to oversleep, apparently, it was one time alarm settings, not the recurrent ones saying, Apple will not say what went wrong with it but, apparently it will be fixed from here on out. I gave my mama an iPad for Christmas.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you did?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and, she opened it up and it was sealed, bought it at the Apples store at Danbury Mall, it was sealed she opened it and it said Happy Holidays, Dennis Piper and Alan Rosenthal (ph). It was engraved by two Endodontists that worked in Norwalk, that was my mama's Christmas gift from us. She kept it though.</p><p>IMUS: I don't quite understand you. Did you Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The iPad was engraved by these two Endodontists who apparently given them to their staff or costumers and somebody returned it to the Apple store and exchange it. But Apple.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, they sold to you for.</p><p>MCDOWELL: .and they sold it to me at no discounted, I might add.</p><p>IMUS: What was the story then, the Apple store?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, Apple store, so, mama got a kick out of it. I thought it was appropriate, you know, Christmas gift, root canals, you know, spending time with your family, all kinds of seems, dove tell together.</p><p>IMUS: I thought she would have been offended that it didn't say Merry Christmas.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, no. She was probably offended by the fact we got her the cheaper one, see the Wi-Fi, we got her the one with where you can -- the AT&amp;T.</p><p>IMUS: That's the one you got to have, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Well, we chintz out on that, Merry Christmas, mama, that's it.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you take it back?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Too lazy, too much trouble.</p><p>IMUS: For your mama?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. She seems happy with it. She's fine. And, I only have to see her like twice a year, what she'll going to do about it?</p><p>IMUS: She's crying inside.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: She has to seem happy, so, she's happy that this marriage of yours is working out apparently, so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She's not happy I'm not living at home with three kids, single.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, and surprised. Thirty three minutes after the hour, time for a Bernie briefing sponsored by PC Richard and Son. And here with all of that is Bernard McGuirk. Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, chief. Well, like most of us during the break, we were either skiing in Switzerland or down in St. Barts, you know, lounging off of P. Diddy's yacht or something. So, we weren't paying attention to a lot of things. But over the break, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>apparently made a phone call as the I-man not doubt heard about to the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, and during the course of a conversation about something else, he mentioned to them that he was very happy that the owner signed their quarterback Michael Vick, who has been just tearing it up on the field, at least he was until a couple of days after this news came out. And he told him that he was glad, because a lot of ex-cons in society don't get a second chance, he was very happy for the success of Michael Vick and the fact that the guy gave him the opportunity and of course a lot of people really just can't believe that he made that kind of phony waded into this controversy unnecessarily.</p><p>IMUS: Plus he has a dog, doesn't he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Don't they have a dog?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's going to need a secret service himself now to protect him from the president.</p><p>IMUS: Michael Vick comes to the White House, well, that is unfair, that's not right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But yes, he does. And, of course, again as I said, that following Sunday, Vick played a terrible game. Not that the two had any connection.</p><p>IMUS: I don't see anything wrong with that. You don't think the president should have weighed in on it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, not at all. I think it's unnecessary again, it's just like the Beer Summit with the cop versus the Harvard professor. You just going to alienate a bunch of people, there's no reason that people now is going to take side, they'll going to hate -- if they needed a reason to hate <person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>this will give it to them, a lot of dog lovers, even though I agree, the guy deserves a second chance.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I don't know. That is working pretty hard trying to find something to wolf on Obama about.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I agree he deserves a second chance but the president should not.</p><p>IMUS: The president deserves a second chance, I'm going to give it to him now. You know, I shouldn't say this. But I actually feel like now, here in New York, we have a governor. I love David Paterson, that's sort of, I guess maybe that is not right. That's not right. Bo Dietl is coming up, we're going to talk to him. Actually, Santa brought you an extra ten pounds, huh?</p><p>RUFINO: Oh!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Thanks, Bernie. Bo Dietl is next. It's one of Peter Rodriguez's five favorite songs, Beatles.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCCORD: You think it, he says it. IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, time now for a business update, from the FOX Business Network, here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Your latest news update, starts with, this story about Facebook in the \"New York Times\" this morning, the report is Goldman Sachs is investing $450 million in Facebook, a Russian Company reportedly also buying $50 million worth of Facebook stock. Now, \"The Times\" is saying this deals value Facebook at $50 billion.

As -- there's a look at some of your top stories, more news coming up as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues, right now, with the check on the forecast.</p><p>SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast. You can see, we do still have rain showers here in the southwest, and snow showers in the higher elevations. Most of the U.S. is looking very clear, and as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain showers in New England along the coastline. The midsection, lots of sunshine, a slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis and as we look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to see many if any delays travel wise, because of the weather. Other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to the rain/snow mix. I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program, on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Eighteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.

I got four iPads because you showed me this, thank God for credit cards, I got this 64 gigabyte with the Wi-Fi for my four children there. And they all got one and, you know what, we lost a great guy last year, George Steinbrenner. Now, I can tell the story. George Steinbrenner did for me like nobody else did for me. My daughter, Dana, who is the -- as a senior at the University of Tampa, at first when she tried to apply there, they only accepting a thousand students and her average was about 3.2, they told her, you have to go to another college and matriculate, she starts crying, dad, I wanted to go there, I wanted to go, I called Brandy Levine and asked Mr. Steinbrenner if he could maybe possibly help her get in. Mr. Steinbrenner got back to me and says, help her get in. Two days later, he was accepted into the University in Tampa. She now has a 4.0, she's on the Dean's list, honors society and she might become the valedictorian for the University of Tampa, my daughter Dana, I'm very proud.</p><p>IMUS: Pretty good, huh?</p><p>DIETL: And George Steinbrenner did it and my love out for the Steinbrenner family, a lot of people don't realize what he does. I sent him.</p><p>IMUS: Why did she want to go there?</p><p>DIETL: No. She's graduating.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, why did she want to go there?</p><p>DIETL: I don't know. It became like a kind of these kids get into a fad like all the friends are going. And then they all want to go -- at the high school, they all want to go. It is a very good school, she's doing teaching of disabled, you know, speech therapy, that kind of stuff, to teach people how to speak, she probably have to.</p><p>IMUS: Should have started with you?</p><p>DIETL: Yes, I know. I knew you were going to say that.</p><p>MCCORD: Is she adopted?</p><p>DIETL: Take it easy. No, she looks just like me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>She looks like just me, but.</p><p>IMUS: Your daughter looks like you?</p><p>DIETL: Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, you know what? Put it this way, they look like a very good-looking version of a fat old man like me.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you are not an unattractive man but...</p><p>DIETL: Yes, so...</p><p>IMUS: Not as much an extra ten pounds but...</p><p>DIETL: All right. Well, you want to know something? I eat. I don't eat lamb's regurgitations and all that stuff like you do. Now, over the holidays.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you don't have cancer like I do.</p><p>DIETL: John Mariotti, it's called \"The Chinese Conspiracy,\" this book is for you.</p><p>IMUS: No, don't give to it me. I won't read it.</p><p>DIETL: OK.</p><p>IMUS: I don't want it.</p><p>DIETL: OK. Well, can I talk about it? Because it's a great novel.</p><p>IMUS: Talk about what you want.</p><p>DIETL: OK. \"The Chinese Conspiracy\" by John Mariotti is a new novel that is out but the novel is based on a lot of facts. We know what happened with the Pentagon, with the breaking into the Supernet computers and all of that kind of stuff, the Chinese.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>DIETL: But this talks about a group of young Chinese guys that wanted to overthrow the old Ancient guard of China. So, what they do is they infiltrate all of our systems, all of our technologies systems, our grid and everything, and they shut down, they shut down the American -- all the IT., all the planes.</p><p>IMUS: What happens?</p><p>DIETL: What?</p><p>IMUS: How does this happen that somebody gets this -- do you know this guy?</p><p>DIETL: I don't know this guy but I'm going to tell you something. I can, I find a book, because.</p><p>IMUS: You can't.</p><p>DIETL: One of your yak-swallowing friends over there, one of your liberal friends, they come over here.</p><p>IMUS: Yak-swallowing friends.</p><p>DIETL: But this guys from \"Newsweek,\" news day, all of the liberal pieces of garbage, they give you something that is OK, this is a great novel because based it's based on fact, \"The Chinese Conspiracy,\" it's about reality, if Greenfield is sitting there, like this, blah, blah, then it would be good. Why can't I have a little, a little show time here? You have all these other guys, these guys that ran away from you, I stand by you! I'm loyal! So, listen to me, once in a while!</p><p>IMUS: All I asked you...</p><p>DIETL: Great book.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, when I got fired, you were going on all of those shows running your fat mouth. I had to -- I had to tell you to shut up, you were talking too much.</p><p>DIETL: I went on with that.</p><p>IMUS: I had to get you to shut up! You were going around quoting me, saying stuff that I never said. I didn't want you to stick up for me, I didn't need to be stuck up for. I didn't want people going around and making any excuses for me. There wasn't any excuse, there is no excuse now. Your mic has been off for five minutes -- a minute.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DIETL: You sit on the board of the directors, you shouldn't be talking about.</p><p>IMUS: Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute.</p><p>DIETL: OK.</p><p>IMUS: All I wondered was, I'm sure the book is fine.</p><p>DIETL: It is great book because...</p><p>IMUS: Fine.</p><p>DIETL: .it is based on fact.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCCORD: He just had a simple question.</p><p>IMUS: I just wonder how you happened -- it happened to come to your attention. Who gave it to you, some friend of yours?</p><p>DIETL: He's a friend of Admiral Straw.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>DIETL: And I was at the Army-Navy game and he has a hat like you wear.</p><p>IMUS: That's not a hat like I wear.</p><p>DIETL: Well, it looks like some.</p><p>IMUS: No, it's not.</p><p>DIETL: All right. OK. And he signed you the book, I'm going to tell you about something, you talk about novel.</p><p>IMUS: He signed the book to me because he wants me to plug the book.</p><p>DIETL: No, you don't have to.</p><p>IMUS: Which I'm not now going to do, because I'm so offended that you attacked me.</p><p>DIETL: I challenged you to read this Don, because it is based on the facts about them taking over.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I'm sure it's fine.</p><p>DIETL: Taking over our country, stopping all our airlines, all our aviation, all our grid, all of that. And we talk about it all of the time.</p><p>IMUS: And your iPads all work...</p><p>DIETL: No. No. No. I got the ones that Wi-Fi. Do you got a Wi-Fi? Can you go on the train and catch a Wi-Fi in 3G?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>DIETL: No, you can't. That is 64 gigahertz.</p><p>IMUS: Of course, why would I buy something else?</p><p>DIETL: Because they didn't have the 64.</p><p>IMUS: Of course they did.</p><p>DIETL: That was only 37.</p><p>IMUS: This is Wi-Fi, also AT&amp;T. Coming up on 11 minutes until the hour. Thank you.

Germany, 1.5 percent, London is closed today for a New Year's holiday and the futures of the U.S., so far, Dow futures have been indicating a higher open, 67 points higher at the moment.</p><p>Now, moving onto your \"FOX Business Minute,\" many iPhone users getting some extra sleep on New Year's day that they didn't want, there was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock feature, users who you set their alarm for a single wake-up found it didn't go off when 2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says, the fix is in the works and all alarms will work properly starting today.

But look at oil, up again, $92 per barrel. As the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right now, here at FOX Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Coming up on five minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I was telling Charles Rangel and the Gangster Mickey that I don't weigh myself very often, occasionally I do. I weighed myself this morning and I'm about, I'm not quite 6 feet tall and I weigh 153 pounds. But because of the way I wear my wranglers, if I weigh 153 pounds and not 150 pounds, I can't get them on. So, it was just my struggle this morning.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Jeff Greenfield.</p><p>MCCORD: A lot of issues.</p><p>IMUS: And Mary Matalin are both coming up, Gangster Mickey and Charles Rangel, all that, just ahead.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS, IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Hard to get on with the depends.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: Hard to get on over the depends.</p><p>IMUS: What did you say?</p><p>BARTLETT: Hard to get on over the depends!</p><p>IMUS: Did I tell you what happened, I e-mail either one about Wyatt's horse?</p><p>BARTLETT: No.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God. This is a horrible story. At the ranch, he gets up at 5:00 in the morning, to go out at the barn with the cowboys, and they feed all the animals. Colder than hell, it's just miserable. So, the Sunday after Christmas, there wasn't anybody there, so he does it. Even though he's only 12, he can still drive the feed truck, I mean, so we bought him his roping horse, buster, great roping horse, potentially great last summer. He goes up to the barn, he finds the horse dead in the stall.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, no.</p><p>IMUS: The horse actually out in the run -- there's (inaudible) runs outside the stall, some barns. Anyway, the horse is on his back with his leg stuck through the gate, dead. So, he comes back, running down to the house, screaming. You can imagine. His mother and I are asleep and I couldn't, I thought it was one of the dogs have died, I couldn't imagine it was his horse died. So, we buried it and put a little note in with it and oh, great.</p><p>MCCORD: It's hard.</p><p>IMUS: Between the animals and I.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: What did they -- hi, happy New Year. What did they do when I was gone, Connell? Did you and Dagen fill in?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. We did you know the old \"BEST OF IMUS\", had some live guests and also tossed to some of your segments, so yes it was Dagen and -- and me. We each took a couple days off around Christmas but we were both here for some of the days.</p><p>IMUS: You know actually, you guys are pretty good.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, thanks. Seriously?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, why?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, I'm just trying to say do you really mean that?</p><p>IMUS: Why you'd think we would have you on the program if we didn't think you were good.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right. That's true.</p><p>IMUS: We could be wrong.</p><p>MCSHANE: As I said to you in the e-mail, where would you be without me? Now that the rating is coming up and everything --</p><p>IMUS: We'd be number one and not number two.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes exactly.</p><p>IMUS: That where we would be.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's -- that was your response.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. Jeff Greenfield of CBS News and Mary Matalin, is I know what she's -- she's the former advisor to Darth Vader, Dick Cheney. And that's -- well, they are all coming up.</p><p>So -- anyway it's time for a little business news, and here to weary out with that is Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'll do my best. Good morning, I-Man.</p><p>Now, the markets here real quick for you this morning are really -- actually looking pretty good to start off the New Year with a survey that came out of China, that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months, but that has eased some of the concerns about inflation over there and markets around the world are higher.</p><p>We'll go to Asia, first of all and show that the Chinese market, the bottom of the screen, the Shanghai composite was up one and three quarters percent overnight; Hong Kong and South Korea -- those are the other markets on the screen -- were also up; and Japan has not yet resumed trading for the New Year.</p><p>In Europe this morning stocks are gaining ground; London is closed for a New Year's holiday but Paris is up almost two percent -- it was up more than percent earlier so it's off the highs; and Germany up by 1.3 percent. So a pretty good start to the day.</p><p>Now, our futures in the U.S. indicating the open on Wall Street, in two- and-a-half hours could be higher. We're up 64 points on DOW futures. And in terms of how we finished 2010, remember it was good year for stocks. I mean, the major indexes were higher, the DOW by 11 percent, the S&amp;P by nearly 13 percent and the NASDAQ, the best of the bunch, up almost 17 percent in 2010.</p><p>Now when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California Congressman Darrell Issa gets a big promotion. He'll become the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, basically overseeing the government. And appearing on Fox News Sunday over the weekend, Issa telling Chris Wallace he's going to target government spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: We have about $1.7 trillion worth of regulatory costs already in the government. If the President wants to throw another $300 billion or $400 billion, what he is doing is taking it right out of businesses, right out of employment, right out of competitiveness. We need to make sure we can compete.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Now Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings, as committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also, Medicare.</p><p>We're starting off the New Year with a busy week on the economic calendar meantime.

Aren't they?</p><p>WOLF: Oh terrible, change the rule. Just because you win the division, nothing, if you have a losing record, you're out and you are replaced by a non-playoff team with the best record.</p><p>IMUS: Why because the Giants are 10 -- 10-6.</p><p>WOLF: Yes and as are the Buccaneers.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: I mean, the point is you want the best teams in there -- who cares - -</p><p>IMUS: Why are -- why are the Seahawks so awful?</p><p>WOLF: Well, the quarterback is no great shakes any more, Hasselbeck. The best player is Leon Washington, the kickoff return man they got from the Jets. And they're in the worst division --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: -- in the NFL.</p><p>IMUS: So Pete Carroll hasn't made any difference going there?</p><p>WOLF: No not this year, but he'll say, we don't care, we won the division.</p><p>IMUS: Right.

Did you know that?</p><p>WOLF: No, well they bet on the rain --</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know what the deal was.</p><p>All right, six minutes after the hour. And for the millions of you who of course can't function in life without knowing how I am --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- and -- and many of you who idolize me, which I -- I can understand.</p><p>MCCORD: Hell, the I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: -- because people in this country no longer have any taste.

And apparently they are not.</p><p>MCCORD: Good.</p><p>IMUS: But I had it over at Mt. Sinai but Dr. Wu did the biopsy. He's a great surgeon, doctor, and another guy who is fabulous, is a -- is a guy by the name of Dr. Allen Reid, who is an anesthesiologist. Fabulous.</p><p>And you know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and -- and -- and also Cornell, but Mt. Sinai is a great hospital, starting with the nurses. And it was under general anesthesia, and what apparently I have are pre-cancerous cells. But -- but I got to thinking about it, all cells are pre-cancerous, aren't they, but some are farther along the road than others.</p><p>MCCORD: Certainly.</p><p>IMUS: So the ones that I have are as far along the road as you want them to get.</p><p>MCCORD: Before getting rid of them.</p><p>IMUS: Before getting rid of them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: So now they have to go on with the laser and laser them off.</p><p>MCCORD: \"Star Wars\" them off there like that.</p><p>IMUS: And which is according to Dr. Wu, who is a -- who is peek-a-boo Wu, who is fabulous by the way. It's an office thing, so -- apparently, I know that is too much information for you.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes it is.</p><p>IMUS: Apparently, I'm fine.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And my voice is a little hoarse, but --</p><p>MCCORD: Not horrible.</p><p>IMUS: Not horrible.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: Here's Chuck with the news.

We'll get to that in a second first, let's check the business news and with that, Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Ok, good morning, I-Man.</p><p>The market coming up at 11 percent gain in 2010 at least for the DOW and nearly 17 percent rise for the NASDAQ, up again this morning indicating the New Year will start off on a good note.</p><p>Then, there's a big story in the \"New York Times\" this morning about Facebook, Goldman Sachs making a $500 million investment in Facebook according to \"The Times\" and a Russian investor also making a sizable investment and so the -- the value of Facebook according to these investments would now be around $50 billion.</p><p>So Facebook would be worth more as \"The Times\" points out, than big tech companies like eBay and Yahoo! and many others, but anyway, Facebook which has obviously been a hot company for some time is getting a big investment now from the -- one of the best known firms on -- or the best known firm on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: And the -- the two twins from Harvard who are -- the rowing twins out there in San Diego.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- who are suing what's his name?</p><p>MCSHANE: Zuckerberg.</p><p>IMUS: Yes they must be happy about this latest development.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, we'll see. Well, they want -- they want their suit, they settled it already for tens of millions of dollars but they want it now to be thrown out so that their shares can be valued higher but Facebook has won every legal challenge of that case which is of course the subject of the movie, the \"Social Network\".</p><p>IMUS: Well, the Connell McShane business report sponsored by Gorilla Trades. Get powerful stock picks for 30 days, sign up now at GorillaTrades.com. It's 14 after the hour.</p><p>Well, Charles had reported that the 9/11 responder bill was signed and \"The New York Times\" had what I thought was kind of an amusing article, particularly for those of us who are fans of Jon Stewart. I suspect Mr. Stewart probably thought it was amusing as well, but Bill Carter who writes all of these books about the late night wars as though somebody cares -- judging by the best-seller list, no one does.</p><p>Compared Mr. Stewart to Everett R. Murrow, which because of Mr. Stewart's rants about the Republicans, who wouldn't support the 9/11 responders bill and which I thought he was right about. But, I thought what made the Republicans come around, of course, Bernie's now claiming that they were able to get $3 billion out of the bill, so that they were -- so that they would pass it. But, whether they would have got that out or not, they were shamed into passing it.</p><p>But I thought when Shep Smith from Fox News was on Fox News, of course. And he had seen the Jon Stewart Show the night before. And so he was talking about it. And when -- he did this spontaneous wrap about how shameful it was that the Republicans were dragging their feet, refusing to pass the bill, and I saw him when he did it. And it appeared to be spontaneous but, in my view, the Republicans watching this could have endured Jon Stewart ragging on them and would have, because it happens all the time.</p><p>But, boy, I would be willing to bet when they turned on Fox News with the huge audience that they have and here's Shep Smith with his -- huge audience that he has. And they lost him, then they've lost the fight. Here's Shep Smith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Last night on Jon Stewart -- it was Jon Stewart's last show of the week and ok, we watched it, whatever. And he just flat on -- absolutely right and it's worth saying, who's going to hold these people's feet to the fire when we're able to put a 52-story building down there so far at Ground Zero.</p><p>We're able to pay for tax cuts from billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the economy but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire? Went down there to save people?</p><p>Did people know what the city was like that day; people walking over bridges, they were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying. Their family members were dead and these people ran to Ground Zero to save people's lives. And we're not going to give them medicine for the illnesses they got down there?</p><p>It is disgusting, it's a national disgrace. It's a shame and everybody who voted against it should have to stand up and account for him or herself. Is anybody going to hold them accountable?</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I think you just did.</p><p>SMITH: I'm not really in a position to do that. I mean I think I just kind of went out there and said what the truth is. And I feel like, I feel like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people.</p><p>There was no warning label on Ground Zero, on 9/11 that these substances will kill you. And even if there had been they would have gone anyway. They just need a little bit of help.</p><p>It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do, doing anything for those people, don't we?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: That is Shep Smith, Fox News. That is big time -- tell me about Fox News.</p><p>MCGUIRK: With Chris Wallace.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Well, he's just sitting there, sucking his thumb --</p><p>MCGUIRK: You had brought that up with Chris Wallace prior to that conversation and then that following Sunday, Chris Wallace brought it up to several politician on his program as well.</p><p>IMUS: That is big time, Shep Smith. You know, and all the Lobster Newburghs of the world. Those of you who run around and won't watch Fox News --</p><p>MCCORD: Pay attention.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, pay attention. They're not doing that -- I didn't see Diane Sawyer doing that. I didn't see that wimp, who by the way won't be in the \"Profiles in Courage\" book, Brian Williams. I didn't see him or the little rodent over there at CBS doing anything.</p><p>Did you? Did you see any of them? Did they have a word to say about that? Who did have a word to say about it? Shep Smith.</p><p>So -- 19 after the hour. Get to Warner in sports in a minute. Calm down.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: In the news this morning, Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its Web site. It's the latest development in this conflict that has been growing between the airlines and on-line travel agencies since American cut ties with Orbitz. The airline says Expedia intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.</p><p>American is looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own Web sites in an effort to save money. Expedia says the move will only cost them ticket sales and believes American's efforts are bad for travelers. Well, there you have it.</p><p>Stocks starting off the New Year with some gains here after a monthly survey in China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and that's worked to ease some inflation concerns.</p><p>Over in Europe this morning, stocks are higher and London is closed for a New Year's holiday but both Paris and Frankfurt are gaining ground.</p><p>Our futures are also higher, ahead of the open on Wall Street which is coming a little over two hours from now. We're up 67 points on Dow futures.</p><p>And commodities, oil is up at $92 a barrel; and gold down, just slightly.</p><p>So, that's a look at some of your top stories and now over to Charles for more of this morning's top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: And they include today, Connell, this -- another big storm hitting southern California; snow and 90 mile-an-hour winds were reported in some locations and authorities have shut done the so-called grapevine portion of I-5, north of Los Angeles.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>signing into law the measure that passes -- that pays, rather, for medical care for first responders to the 9/11 terror attacks, New York, '01. The legislation sets up this $4 billion compensation fund to help those people.</p><p>And a top navy officer under fire for producing and appearing in a series of raunchy orientation videos, broadcast to nearly 6,000 crewmembers of the USS Enterprise. In the videos Captain Owen Honors and other crewmembers can be seen cursing and using anti-gay slurs among other things.</p><p>Those are some of the headlines as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues now right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty-five after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It's a prime example Bernard, of what I was talking to you about off the air.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right. Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: Idiot sales department (INAUDIBLE) -- they're all talking about it now. They write these commercials and the commercials are 90 seconds long, but they pay for 60 seconds.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So I read for 60 seconds and then I stop reading so I don't know what they want left in or out or who knows.</p><p>MCCORD: Essential information, right.</p><p>IMUS: And I want to help them out, one of them is for GNC, it's a great nutrition center, they're great.</p><p>I have no idea what they -- by the way, at this point if they're not on top of it and the stupid sales department at the radio station is not, then, I can't be worried about it.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Too much.</p><p>IMUS: And now I've got myself all worked up here and I was doing fine up to now.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Time for sports and here with that is the great Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Good morning. Thank you, I-man.</p><p>Well, completing the play-off picture last night, the Seahawks finishing 7- 9, beat the Rams 16-6; they win the NFC west. And as you said, even the Seattle fans wanted the Seahawks to lose so they would get a higher draft pick.</p><p>The Packers win the wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3. The Colts win the AFC south, beating the Titans, 23-20. Although they didn't know it at the time, they had already won it minutes earlier because the Jags lost. Steelers win the AFC. Falcons win the NFC.</p><p>And finally, I-man, MVP, there's going to be no question about it, Tom Brady finishes with 36 touchdowns and just four interceptions.</p><p>IMUS: How did he play -- he's playing better than he ever has.</p><p>WOLF: Ever, all-time. Not anytime.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>WOLF: Not every time --</p><p>IMUS: That will be fine.</p><p>WOLF: Not Greenwich Time.</p><p>IMUS: That will be fine. Time for a little business news now, oh, my God. And here with that is the girl with the purple dress on, purple rain, purple rain. Dagen McDowell -- good morning Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir. I was trying to get all gussied up for your return.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm glad you did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. At least I came back from Christmas with all my teeth because there's always that danger.</p><p>IMUS: How would you lose your teeth?</p><p>MCDOWELL: A fight, fall down or there's always that, you know, peanut brittle sitting around the house.</p><p>IMUS: Or Santa come down that chimney and you're there under the tree and haven't been rubbing that Chamonix on yourself and so Santa would be disappointed, wouldn't he? And look like you been left out in the rain, girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He would punch me -- would punch me in the mouth.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let's hope not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: For not keeping my skin soft and supple.</p><p>IMUS: Well, anyway, what's going on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. The movie business was boo -- bad last year. Overall attendance was down more than 5 percent; the lowest number of tickets sold to the movies since 1996. Now, total revenue was north of $10 billion because ticket prices are higher. People are going to 3-D movies, which cost more money, but one, one notable disappointment was that Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolie movie \"The Tourist\" at end of the year. So, I reckon paying have gotten tired of paying to see that hussy with the puffy lips stand around.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you offing (ph) on her.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: You don't like her --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't. No, not at all.</p><p>IMUS: You know who seems kind of cute is Reese Witherspoon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, that movie didn't do so well either; that new movie that she's in.</p><p>IMUS: She's going to marry her agent, you know. Did you know that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Yes, I did. Jim Toff (ph) is his name, by the way.</p><p>IMUS: And how about Shania Twain?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Getting married to the ex-husband of the woman that Mutt Lang, Shania's ex-husband, left her for. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Now, that's a trailer park --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RUFINO: I'm my own grandpa right there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you know what? That's why you got to love her.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. All's well that ends well. She grew up hard knocks, man. Now she's found love.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, I know she did. Yes. I thought she's good. I've always liked her, but the girl -- she married Mutt Lange who produced all her records.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And he -- didn't he produce Def Leppard for a long time?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, he did.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Foreigner.</p><p>IMUS: Foreigner. So he's a great record producer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: But apparently that wasn't enough and she wasn't enough. So he was having an affair with her assistant, right, or his assistant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. She was like the house manager, I thought, something like that.</p><p>IMUS: OK. And so, Shania, of course, found out about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it was Shania's best friend.</p><p>IMUS: And Shania's best friend. Sure.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: So he was always there, that's unfortunate. So now, are they married now?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know if they're married.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now, but that woman's ex-husband, they are married, OK. Mutt and the woman -- Mutt and the woman are married and the woman's ex-husband just married Shania.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel dizzy right now.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: Now, Shania, she's down in Nashville. There's a bunch of people available, a bunch of these good looking cowboy singers. And I just, I just didn't understand that. That's sort of screwed up, isn't it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, he's hot.</p><p>IMUS: He is?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The guy she married is smoking, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's like -- yes, he's European looking. He's --</p><p>IMUS: He's cute?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, all right. Well, never mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And those cowboys will cheat on you quicker than they'll sneeze, so why drive down that road again?</p><p>IMUS: Well, Mutt Lange is not a cowboy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know, but the cowboys will cheat, too. Find a man who will stay honest to you.</p><p>IMUS: Like Tim McGraw, he married, down the road with what's her name. Figure, well, why not, so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What a tough decision for him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Faith Hill or hmmm -- I wonder --</p><p>IMUS: Years ago -- years ago, my brother and Phil Sweet wrote a song called \"\"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You, which eventually went to number one. It won the Music City News Record of the Year, country record, and is recorded by Jim Ed Brown of The Browns, you know. And Helen Cornelius.</p><p>Now, Helen, she was married. Well, you know where this story is going. And so was Jim, he was married. But they get this big hit record \"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You\", I don't want to have to say I do. And so they're on tour and they're on the bus and they discovered some -- one of them, one of the husbands or either her husband or his wife discovered that between the two compartments on the bus where Jim Ed Brown would sleep and where the other compartment where old Helen was asleep, there was a trap door.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: No way.</p><p>IMUS: There's like a, where your dog comes in and out. So one of them was wiggling through the trap door.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, for crying out loud.</p><p>IMUS: I don't want to have to marry you.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. I don't have to go through that trap door.</p><p>IMUS: Man, oh, man.</p><p>All right, 33 after the hour. Jeff Greenfield is coming up. But first, time for a briefing sponsored by our friends at P.C. Richard &amp; Son. And here with that is Bernard McGuirk.</p><p>Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yo, chief. Well, a lot happened since the break began for us a couple of weeks ago. The Bush tax cuts extended, \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" repealed. The death panels are back and Obamacare and the blizzard of 2010 further revealed Mayor Mike Bloomberg could be the arrogant schmuck we all knew he was.</p><p>IMUS: Two best news. The \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and the 9/11 responder bill.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. That was signed just yesterday by the president in Hawaii, robbing Chuck Schumer of his moment in the spotlight. He couldn't be there at the signing. However, before all this happened, Larry King signed off and during that show, a funny thing happened while Larry King was interviewing Bill Clinton which pretty much went unnoticed. They were talking about both being heart surgeon patients, members of the \"zipper club\" but that was a little confusing. But here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOICE OF: LARRY KING, HOST, \"LARRY KING LIVE\": You look well fit. Are you feeling well?</p><p>VOICE OF: BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I feel great. I've been traveling quite a bit, but as you pointed out I just got back from Haiti. And I'm kind of like you, I have to keep working. I don't know if it keeps me young, but at least it keeps me out of the grave.</p><p>KING: We're both in the \"zipper club.\" By the way, the suits want me to remind you what the \"zipper club\" is. It's if you've had open heart surgery, they have to zipper it up. So I thought everyone in the world knew it but apparently --</p><p>CLINTON: I'm glad you clarified that.</p><p>KING: I see what you mean. Oh, oh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: The big dog acknowledging and can be self-deprecating at this point.</p><p>IMUS: Of course, we lost a character when Larry -- what's Larry going to do now?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, he's still going to work. He's going to be a contributor.</p><p>He better, right. He has to be.</p><p>IMUS: Wasn't he ragging on Hannity and Rachel Maddow?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He did somewhere. I read something about that. He was --</p><p>IMUS: Both of them were kicking his ass, by the way. Hannity by a lot and her by some.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Hannity drove Larry King off the air, essentially.</p><p>IMUS: So he gets on. He's bad-mouthing Rachel Maddow and Hannity who were both killing him.</p><p>All right, Greenfield is next. Twenty-five until the hour.</p><p>MUSIC: Oh, I love the clothes she wears and the way the sunlight plays upon her hair. Oh, I hear the sound of a church bell off the wind that lifts her perfume through the air. I'm picking up good vibrations. She's giving me the excitations. I'm picking up good vibrations.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm so irritable this morning that I just don't know if I can recover.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: The bailout program for boring radio.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the FOX Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: All right. Here's your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>As many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's day, there was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock features. Users have set their alarm for a single wakeup. Found it didn't go off when 2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all alarms will work properly starting today. But apparently users in Europe and Asia say they are still having some problems.</p><p>Vizio, the maker of inexpensive flat-screen TVs looking now to expand. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell phones and tablet computers. The two products, the Via Phone and the Via Tablet will be introduced this summer from the company. The announcement comes days ahead of the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.</p><p>As for the markets this morning, let's check in on the futures once again. They've been higher all morning long. Dow futures now up by 84 points as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p>SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning. I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast.</p><p>You can see we do still have rain showers here in the southwest and snow showers in the higher elevations. Most of the U.S. is looking very clear. And as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain showers in New England along the coastline. The midsection, lots of sunshine. A slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis. And as we look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to see very many if any delays travel-wise because of the weather, other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to that rain- snow mix.</p><p>I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Nineteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Mary Matlin is coming up. Tomorrow, Tom Friedman. And then on Wednesday, Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus, \"Blond on Blond.\" This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by Time Warner cable business class. You first, the technology follows.</p><p>Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from CBS News, Jeff Greenfield. Good morning, Mr. Greenfield.</p><p>JEFF GREENFIELD, CBS NEWS (via telephone): Good morning, Don. Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Happy New Year to you. I apologize for being late.</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know, it's -- I mean, I would not have missed the conversation about all those country stars and their lives for anything. So it was fine, you know?</p><p>IMUS: I sense a note of sarcasm in your voice.</p><p>GREENFIELD: No. Me, on this show? Don't be silly.</p><p>IMUS: It just hurts my feelings because --</p><p>GREENFIELD: No, you are the audio version of Oprah's new network. Nothing but good feelings.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder how that's going to work out for her.</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know, I don't know. It's in a way unprecedented that an entire network is built around the appeal of one person although she's hardly, you know, your ordinary figure. And I guess it involves everything from whether or not some of her viewers are going to want to pay the extra fee. She's not on pay cable, but on a lot of network, a lot of cable systems she's not on the basic cable. There is some fluff about that. And the real question is, I guess, can you sustain 24 hours based on the world view of one person although as I say in her case that's just one extraordinary media figure. I mean, she certainly has built something over the years that is just unprecedented in, you know, media. So good luck to her.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I like her. I don't know why I like her. I don't watch her show, I just like her.</p><p>GREENFIELD: She's a -- I can say -- I think, I think you don't connect at that level with so many people at that level of intensity unless there's something there, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe Barbara Walters should have asked her if she was a lesbian?</p><p>GREENFIELD: I don't know, Don. Let me take that under prayerful consideration.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder what you thought. I didn't so, I like Barbara Walters, too.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, OK.</p><p>IMUS: So the 9/11 responders bill is signed that finally, huh?</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, and I think you were very wise in showing that clip from Shep Smith, because I think between him and Stuart, you had -- I think Shep is a straight arrow newscaster, but certainly the FOX Network is watched overwhelmingly by folks of a conservative persuasion and Stuart's show is watched overwhelmingly by folks with a liberal persuasion. When you have people on both sides coming at that issue and basically saying shame to the people who voted against it, I think those twin factors played a big role in getting that bill through.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know if many Democrats watch FOX News somewhere?</p><p>GREENFIELD: No, they do, because, first of all, FOX News as a cable network is by far the most watched cable network, and it isn't that Democrats don't watch it. But in the surveys that I have seen over the years and it shouldn't surprise anybody, the predominantly majority view of those who watch tends to the right. It's just the predominant view of those who watch MSNBC tends to the left. And this is about reassurance and reaffirmation of what you believe is right.</p><p>I may have told you the story. I talked once to a Democratic senator who told me that the television set is always on at MSNBC at home. And I said why after 12 hours of debate in the Senate, you go home and watch more politics? And the answer was, it's like soaking in a nice warm bath, you know. And I think that's true for a lot of people who turn on a cable news network, that basically tells them what you basically think that's right. And I think it's one of the reasons why my former places of business, CNN, had such a prime time ratings. There are a lot of others, but people basically I think, that is to say the people who watch cable news, and remember it's a big minority of television viewers. You're talking about three percent of, you know, television homes. Folks turn that stuff on either to be told they're right or in the case of, you know, Democrats watching FOX or Republicans watching MSNBC to get the blood going.</p><p>IMUS: I was so happy we were able to get you away from CNN over to CBS. I can't tell you.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, I'm sure you played your part.</p><p>IMUS: I hated the fact. Well, I kept saying to Rick Kaplan, who was a big fan of yours, by the way, as are a lot of people.</p><p>GREENFIELD: He's now one of my bosses. He's the executive producer of Katie Couric's show.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you be -- why wouldn't we get Greenfield over to CBS News and get him out of that hell hole over there.</p><p>GREENFIELD: The only thing I can tell you is the cafeteria at CNN was much better than the cafeteria at CBS.</p><p>IMUS: Did you watch the Rose Bowl?</p><p>GREENFIELD: I did, that's my alma mater.</p><p>IMUS: That's what I asked.</p><p>GREENFIELD: I thought it was a really good game. I was the only big 10 team that was competitive I think in all those -- how many bowl games are there now? About 35 quite literally?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD: So it's one missed field goal.</p><p>IMUS: That was my only connection to the game is I knew that you had gone to school there before you went to Harvard or Yale, wherever the hell you went.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, right.</p><p>IMUS: And that they were playing TCU. Of course, I was rooting for TCU, but that's just because I'm a big Texas fan. So --</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, Bob Schieffer is. In fact, I regretted the fact that he and I didn't get a bet down. Although now that Wisconsin lost, I don't know would have had to -- I don't know what I would have had to do, you know, appeared on the air in a TCU warm-up jacket. I guess that was a really good game and I must say that, you know, I didn't, I didn't call the University of Wisconsin in high dungeon and say no more contributions from me because you lost the football game. That's perhaps taking it a bit too far.</p><p>IMUS: If you're one of the people like I am who thinks that Sarah Palin is -- I don't know if I think she's a dope or not, but whatever. But let me ask you this, how much worse off would the country or better off would the country be where she president?</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know what?</p><p>IMUS: The answer is not --</p><p>GREENFIELD: First of all -- no, first, she's dumb like a fox. I mean, here's somebody who's turned the governorship of Alaska and an unsuccessful bid for vice-president into a multi-million dollar empire where she gets to talk only to people who like her for $100,000 a more pop, you know, is a favorite on the most watched cable news network in the country and makes millions of dollars selling books. This is how dumb she is.</p><p>IMUS: Very good.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, that's --</p><p>Two Cadillacs outside.</p><p>IMUS: You remember.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking of when people talk about how dumb he is, that preacher guy.</p><p>One of my favorite routines. But you know, that's a question probably better asked to people who -- who would ideologically tend to be on her side. I think it's really interesting that either a majority or maybe close to of Republicans don't think she's qualified to be president.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD: So what she has is an enormously intensely loyal base of people who like her and think any criticism of her is just an example of left wing media bias.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe it's a little like Oprah. We all like her but we just don't want her to run anything.</p><p>All right. I've got to go, but thank you very much.</p><p>GREENFIELD: -- that analogy completely, but I do think that she's going to have a significant role whether she's a candidate or not in 2012.</p><p>IMUS: All right. I've got to go.</p><p>GREENFIELD: OK. Well, Happy New Year and it's two months to start plugging my book like a banshee (ph).</p><p>IMUS: I will do anything for you. Jeff Greenfield, CBS News.</p><p>MUSIC: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: The stocks starting off the new year with some gains here. The monthly survey coming out of China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and that actually is easing some inflation concerns and some optimism about our economy as well, ahead of some key economic data points later in the week. Europe is up across the board. London is closed today for the New Year's holiday. And our futures are up across the board. The Dow futures ahead of the open on Wall Street now up almost triple digits. So we're adding to the gains as we get closer to the open.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants to put on the market. The blood test is billed as being able to spot a single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells. J&amp;J is teaming up with scientists who invented this test to make it cheaper and better and their hope is that the blood test can take the place eventually of more invasive cancer tests.</p><p>Goldman Sachs investing $450 million in Facebook according to the \"New York Times.\" A Russian company also buying $50 million worth of Facebook stock and as we've reported, the SEC now looking into the secondary market trading on Facebook's privately held shares.

And it is. And gold after being lower earlier has now turned slightly higher.</p><p>More news coming up at the top of the hour but it's IMUS IN THE MORNING that continues right now. FOX Business, power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: We got so far behind. So what are you saying now? We haven't lost Larry King?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So this is pathetic.</p><p>BARTLETT: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Can't you come up with something else? You're a professional comedian.</p><p>BARTLETT: I happen to come up with something else. He's a great character. You don't want to lose him.</p><p>MCCORD: He's still going to be around doing specials and stuff. He's just not going to have a show.</p><p>TONY POWELL: You're going to make him to do whatever --</p><p>BARTLETT: We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>BARTLETT: We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS: Well, yes, but that's different.</p><p>MCCORD: That's Nixon.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, it's Nixon.</p><p>IMUS: It's Nixon.</p><p>MCCORD: No, but you --</p><p>IMUS: You're saying we can still do Larry King?</p><p>BARTLETT: Why not? It's not like he's dead.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, he is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: But that's been for a while.</p><p>IMUS: He's a no-good bastard, by the way.</p><p>MCCORD: Who?</p><p>IMUS: Larry King. I used to be friends with him, but he's a creep. And his wife is a bigger creep.</p><p>POWELL: What are you saying?</p><p>BARTLETT: How about Rex Ryan?</p><p>IMUS: What about him?</p><p>BARTLETT: Him as a character.</p><p>IMUS: That's a weird dude, you know that.</p><p>BARTLETT: You think.</p><p>IMUS: No, but I mean, that toe-sucking thing?</p><p>BARTLETT: Well, that was, you know --</p><p>IMUS: Don't you think that's --</p><p>BARTLETT: I think what's interesting at first is the tripping controversy.</p><p>IMUS: And that girl got some fudgy feet, too, by the way. Did you see her feet?</p><p>MCCORD: Saw the photographs, yes.</p><p>IMUS: She should be wearing brogans.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: So I said to Carly (ph), how are you, happy New Year. So I say to Carly, I want a -- I'm drinking this tea that is supposed to kill cancer cells.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So -- and I'm happy to do it. So I said I wanted another cup. So she just brings over an empty cup, you know --</p><p>MCSHANE: Good for her. You deserve that.</p><p>IMUS: But I -- because I didn't specify what I wanted.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But it turns out we're out of the tea, so -- anyway, Seahawks won the football game last night, in case you just turned your -- whatever you have on, on. Your toaster.</p><p>MCSHANE: Your toaster.</p><p>IMUS: And --</p><p>MCSHANE: Seven and nine in the playoffs.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, which doesn't make any sense to me, but I don't care. So, are you a football fan, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, I'm a Jet fan. I was at the Jet game yesterday with my son and it was fun. And they won their -- well, they were already in the playoffs, but they won. So they go 11-5.</p><p>IMUS: Why would you pick a game to go to that meant nothing?</p><p>MCSHANE: Because you know why -- that's actually a good point. But we hadn't been to a game at the new stadium yet. So I decided on Saturday, the weather wasn't going to be too cold and he had never been to a game at the new stadium, so let's go. So we went.</p><p>IMUS: What kind of seats did you have?</p><p>MCSHANE: We had good seats. We were right behind -- they were actually in the second row -- they were technically in the 11th row but they were right behind the tunnel, you know, where the players run in. So they were in the second row behind that tunnel in the end zone and three of the touchdowns were right in our end zone, right where we were sitting. So it was pretty cool.</p><p>IMUS: Did you buy the tickets?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I bought them on -- I just bought them on Stub Hub the day before the game, online.</p><p>IMUS: Wouldn't there be some way, if you were going to go, you could -- you could let me know and then we could call Warner --</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And have you sit in the box with the owner?</p><p>MCSHANE: You know what, but then I'd owe you something.</p><p>IMUS: You owe me a lot now, by the way, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I do. Yes, I do.</p><p>IMUS: It's time for a little business news now and here is Connell McShane.</p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: I didn't want to add to it.</p><p>Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Now, let's look at the markets here this morning to see how things are starting off the week. Stocks -- starting off the year, really. It's the first trading day of the year with some gains. There's a monthly survey out of China that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months, and that's easing concerns about inflation. If you look at Asia, for example, the Shanghai composite, the Chinese market at the bottom of the screen, up 1.75 percent. Kospi in South Korea, Hang Seng in Hong Kong all up on the day. Japan has not yet resumed trading in the new year.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are up. London's close also today because of the New Year's holiday. Paris is up 2 percent. Look at that. Germany up 1.3 percent. And our futures indicating the open on Wall Street in an hour and a half is going to be significantly higher. Dow futures up almost triple digits, up 92 points.</p><p>All right. Now, in terms of how we fared last year, as it is, in 2010, there's the recap. The Dow up 11 percent. The S&amp;P almost 13 percent. And the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, higher by almost 17 percent.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on even more debt. The national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion ceiling. White House Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Austan Goolsbee on ABC \"This Week\" saying it's crucial that ceiling is raised.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: This is not a game. You know, the debt ceiling is not -- is not something to toy with. That's the -- the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that's the -- essentially defaulting on our obligations, which is totally unprecedented in American history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree that it needs to be raised, but many are also saying they wouldn't go along with that unless they get promises to change Washington's spending habits. They argue there's no point in even having a debt ceiling if it's simply raised every time the national debt gets close.</p><p>Bank of America taking a $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter. It's related to mortgages sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bank making the payment to Fannie and Freddie as part of a settlement over mortgages sold by Countrywide Financial. Now, Bank of America, remember, bought Countrywide three years ago and Bank of America shares are actually rising this morning on the news.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants to put in the open -- on the market. Now, the blood test is billed as being able to spot a single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells. J&amp;J is teaming with the scientists who invented the test to make it cheaper and better. The hope is that the blood tests can take the place of more invasive cancer tests.</p><p>And many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day. There was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock feature. Users who set their alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't even -- it didn't go off when 2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all alarms, they say, will be working properly starting today.</p><p>As for commodities this morning, the oil price has been up above $92 a barrel and is higher than that now as well. $1,423 or thereabouts for gold. Up $2 after being lower earlier.</p><p>Mary Matalin coming up a little bit later this hour with the I-man as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now here at Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: I can't hear you. (INAUDIBLE) here. What's the matter with you?</p><p>It is five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Mary Matalin is coming up.</p><p>Well, I can't hear you. We're trying to -- we're sitting here talking about the guy who does the \"Red Eye\" show on the Fox News Channel. It's on at 3:00 a.m. Gary --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Greg.</p><p>IMUS: Gray --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Gutfield.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfield.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Or Feld. Feld, actually.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfeld.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I said, I had a suspicion that he might be pretty good. My wife says he is. And now here's how he came to my attention, because I was watching the Fox New Year's Eve thing. I was out at the ranch.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I was watching <person><nameText>Megyn Kelly, </nameText></person>who I like, and Bill Hemmer, who I like him, too. And they were just way too happy. I mean that girl was so happy, she was beside herself. And she's about 29 months pregnant. So she's got the baby coming up here.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: And they were just hysterical. Now, I didn't stay with them to see the ball come down, because I don't do that. If you -- if you watch the ball come down --</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: You can't be a bigger loser in life. You can't do it. And if you're there, most of the people in Times Square itself are from somewhere else. They're tourists. They're not -- there's no New Yorkers who I know, and I've been here for a long time, 30 years, who go there and stand there and, you know, let people pee on you while they -- while you're waiting for the ball to come down. I just don't think that happens, do you, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's not going to happen.</p><p>IMUS: All right. So, I was asking about -- so, anyway, he was on, the \"Red Eye\" guy, not the radio red eye guy, the other one, the TV \"Red Eye\" guy. And so we -- I thought, well, let's have him on. Let's have him as a guest. But first we have to find -- I mean I'm not interested in -- we didn't get to be a successful as we are by experimenting, although we did used to do that. But we don't do that anymore. We don't experiment with talent. So, I guess, what's the matter, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: There's something on your shoulder, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: There is?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, on your --</p><p>MCSHANE: Your coming apart.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you know, hey, Connell --</p><p>MCCORD: Uh-oh.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, Trevor. You know what happened?</p><p>MCGUIRK: (INAUDIBLE). Damn it, someone!</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Easy mistake.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Can you hear us now, chief? He can't hear us.</p><p>IMUS: No, I can't hear you, you little bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, thanks for telling us.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Connell, this thing -- I mean, Trevor, this thing came loose again.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'll fix it for you.</p><p>IMUS: Well, actually, he can fix it.</p><p>All right, time for a little news and here with that --</p><p>MCSHANE: Is Trevor.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter?</p><p>MCCORD: Just the ongoing saga of the ear monitors.</p><p>IMUS: These are my $1,500 ear monitors.</p><p>MCCORD: There's something every freakin' 15 minutes.</p><p>IMUS: That won't stay together.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But what about Greg Gutfeld?</p><p>IMUS: Well, we're going to watch him -- I'm going to watch his show tonight --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: And if he's any good, we'll have him on. I bet he must be, wouldn't you think? Have you ever seen it, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. I have not really seen the show. It's on, as you said, 3:00 in the morning, no.</p><p>IMUS: My wife says he's good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And Opie, Anthony -- Anthony's on a lot, right?</p><p>BARTLETT: Supposedly.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we know Anthony's funny. I'll listen (ph).</p><p>Here's Chuck with the news.</p><p>MCCORD: The president says he is honored to have signed the bill to provide the aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks and first responders who became ill working at Ground Zero. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, named after a police officer who died of a respiratory disease that he contracted during the 9/11 operations, his father now says he is happy others will finally be getting the help they need.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an important not only because my son was sick for four years, you know, and we watched him die and we couldn't get no help for him. Now -- there was -- no one would recognize that he was sick from the World Trade Center.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: The bill provides $4.2 billion in help to sick workers and several hundred people who live near the burning pile, the toxicity at the World Trade Center ruins. The president signing the measure in private as his Hawaiian vacation neared its end.</p><p>IMUS: Bill Carter, a journalist from \"The New York Times,\" who's a nice guy, by the way. Writes all these books about the late night talk show wars that nobody cares about and no one reads. And -- but they're good. I guess I read them. (INAUDIBLE). He and some other clown wrote an article over the past couple of weeks about Jon Stewart being perhaps the new Edward R. Murrow --</p><p>MCCORD: Crusader.</p><p>IMUS: Which I suspect even Mr. Stewart, who I am a fan of --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Found amusing. If not ironic, except every time I use the word ironic, with apologies to Nora Ephron, I always wonder if I'm using it correctly.</p><p>MCCORD: Correct.</p><p>IMUS: And I suspect I'm not. But at any rate, because Stewart was railing about the Republicans who had embraced tragedy of 9/11 as almost their campaign mantra slogan deal, and that they were not entitled to do that anymore because essentially they had refused, which I thought was a disgrace and so did Mr. Stewart. So he talked about it. Then he had some of the responders on. So they were, Mr. Carter and some other dope from \"The Times,\" were crediting Mr. Stewart with providing the impetus for this to be passed, which I thought, well, it might have brought some attention to it, but it certainly didn't spur any Republicans to change their minds about it or to feel some sort of necessity to take action on this and to realize how absolutely disgraceful they were behaving.</p><p>But I saw Shep Smith -- I played this last hour and it's worth playing again. I'll tell you why. Because he does the news on -- he does the news two hours on it on the Fox News Channel. And some of my friends, like Esther Newberg, I love her to death, but is one of these elitist, liberal snobs who, you know, they all think they have all the answers and she's one of these people who refuses to watch Fox News because she thinks they have some sort of agenda and yet, like a moron, she'll watch MSNBC or CNN, who are both dreadful and disgraceful and clearly do have an agenda or, say, CBS or ABC or, for God's sake, NBC.</p><p>So I would call her attention, and I would call to Mr. Carter's attention as well, what Shep Smith had to say about it. And Shep Smith -- I'm going to play it in a second -- referenced Jon Stewart. What I think is significant about it is, is that if you're a Republican like John Thune, I had that dope on, and some of these other people who were dragging their feet and just refusing to vote on this, and Senator Thune had these lame excuses that he gave me. And much to my discredit, I didn't press him on it and should have, but I thought, well, he didn't want to rush into anything and it was too much other money was -- it was a bunch of pork and stuff in it and even that was kind of Bernie's rap on this. And people like Hannity and some of these other dopes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Those are the facts.</p><p>IMUS: The facts are nothing. The point is -- the facts are stupid. The point is, it should have been passed and, of course, now it was passed and they did take out about $3 billion of pork.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: My point, God, if I could make the point, is that when Shep Smith talked about it, that got the attention of all of the Republicans and everyone else, because they're thinking, if Shep Smith, with that enormous audience that he has and that Fox News has, if he's against this, then as Walter Cronkite famously said or Lyndon Johnson said about Walter Cronkite during the Vietnam War, if we've lost him, we've lost the country. Here's Shep Smith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS: Last night on Jon Stewart, it was Jon Stewart's last (INAUDIBLE) of the week and, OK, we watch it. Whatever. And he's just flat on, absolutely right. And it's worth saying, who's going to hold these people's feet to the fire when we -- you know, we're able to put a 52 story building down there so far at Ground Zero. We're able to pay for tax cuts for billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the economy, but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire, went down there to save people. The people knew what this city was like that day. People were walking over bridges. They were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying. Their family members were dead. And these people ran to Ground Zero to stave people's lives. And we're not going to even give them medicine for the illnesses that they got down there. It's disgusting. It's a national disgrace. It's a shame. And everybody who voted against it should have to stand up and account for himself or herself. Is anybody going to hold them accountable?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you just did.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I'm not really in a position to do that. I mean I think I just kind of went out there and said what the truth is and I feel like -- I feel like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people. There was no warning label on Ground Zero on 9/11 \"these substances will kill you.\" And even if there had been, they'd have gone anyway. They just need a little bit of help. It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do doing anything for those people, don't we?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: So that's Shep Smith, Fox News. So the next time one of you want to tell me about Fox News, I'm going to tell you about Shep Smith. That's what I'm talking about.</p><p>Now, I didn't see Diane Sawyer and I didn't see that coward Brian Williams or that little rodent over there. Well, we don't need to get into name calling, Don.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, why are we?</p><p>IMUS: Or the very lovely Katie Couric --</p><p>MCCORD: Better.</p><p>IMUS: Or the -- well, not so courageous, that's a better way to put it, Brian Williams. Did you ever -- did -- what -- did they say anything about it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, of course not. Were they railing about it at MSNBC? Well, of course not. So that's what I'm talking about. So if you're the John Thunes of the world and you turn that on -- it's on all the time here -- if you see Shep Smith calling you out --</p><p>MCCORD: Then, wait a minute.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, Chris Wallace in there sucking his thumb, thinking, oh, I hope I don't get in trouble.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, he brought it up on the Sunday show.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, quarter after the hour. Time for a little sports now.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And the (INAUDIBLE) Democrats controlled Congress for two years, with the Democratic president, and they waited till the lame duck session to try to pass this (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>IMUS: Save all that for next time you're on Hannity.</p><p>It's 16 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I'll get an e-mail from Hannity.</p><p>Did we do your business report yet, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: Not yet, I don't think.</p><p>IMUS: No, OK, we can do it in a minute. Don't worry about it.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK, I'm not.</p><p>IMUS: Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf.</p><p>Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Well, they completed the playoff picture last night. The lonely Seattle Seahawks finishing 7-9, beat the Rams 16-6. They win the NFC West. Change the rule, man. Forget winning the division, you can't have a losing record. You're out. Replaced by the non-playoff team with the best record. The Giants, by the way, will bring back Tom Coughlin.</p><p>Packers win their final wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3.. That eliminated the Giants. The Colts win the AFC South, beat the Titans 23-20. Adam Vinatieri's 43 yard field goal, last play of the game. Although the Colts didn't know it, because they didn't show the score on the scoreboard. They had actually won it minutes earlier when the Jags lost. The Steelers win the AFC North. The Falcons win the NFC South.</p><p>And the NBA last night, in Los Angeles, before a rare booing crowd, they booed the Lakers at the Staples Center. The Lakers lost to the Grizzlies by 19 points, 104-85. And after the game, Phil Jackson blamed it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, early in the third quarter on some stupid plays, and, you know, Kobe has to screw up the, you know, game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one. That takes the rest of the guys out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Wow, Kobe screwing up the game.</p><p>IMUS: So Kobe was going one-on-one with some other member of the other team, obviously, duh, right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, one of the members of -- one of the audience members.</p><p>IMUS: Well, speaking of the audience, here's what's wrong with the Lakers.</p><p>WOLF: What is it?</p><p>IMUS: It's one thing if Jack Nicholson wants to have floor seats -- I mean, I think he deserves those. He's earned them, don't you think?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But not Larry David. Not some sit -- not some sitcom dope.</p><p>MCCORD: What's he done?</p><p>IMUS: Well, should be sitting there -- I mean you just can't.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, work it --</p><p>IMUS: And yet I watched the game on Christmas Day, the brain did -- of course I'm furiously e-mailing Breen my comments as he's trying to do the game, which I'm sure -- and he sometimes answers them, by the way.</p><p>WOLF: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: But Larry David? How possibly could Larry David -- who gave Larry David a floor seat? That's a disgrace.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He only created \"Seinfeld.\" Come on.</p><p>IMUS: What does \"Seinfeld\" have do with it. Seinfeld must have something to do with it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, a little bit. Larry David's a genius?</p><p>IMUS: Still shouldn't be sitting on -- he's a sitcom dope. He shouldn't be sitting on the floor.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get him out.</p><p>IMUS: He just don't. He may be a genius, but he shouldn't be sitting on the floor. This is the guy you were screaming about he peed on Jesus.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we all stray.</p><p>IMUS: He's -- he is a genius or you -- or he peed on Jesus. You can't pee on Jesus, can you?</p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: And be a genius.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The two are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>IMUS: It doesn't take a genius to pee on Jesus. It takes 12 -- well, it takes probably a drunk or, you know --</p><p>MCGUIRK: The fact that he got away with it, that was so offensive.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Anyway, 19 after the hour.</p><p>So, were you finished with sports, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: His third sack of the game.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Time for a little business news and here with that is Connell McShane.</p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Just a few quick headlines for you this morning. The market is up again after an 11 percent gain for the Dow in 2010. And the 17 percent rise for the Nasdaq in 2010. The futures are way up this morning. Maybe some optimism about economic data. We had plenty of it this week. Construction spending and manufacturing today. The big retail reports out for the month of December on Thursday and the jobs report for the month of December on Friday.</p><p>So that is there, plus the report, I-man, in \"The New York Times\" that we talked about earlier that Facebook has received an investment of $500 million from Goldman Sachs, according to \"The Times,\" which values Facebook at $50 billion.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. And then Dagen McDowell, who will be coming up in a few minutes. She and Connell do their very own show at 11:00 a.m. on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour. Here's one of Mary Matalin's five favorite songs.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: Well, let me tell you about Lindamood-Bell. You know what, the lady who runs Lindamood-Bell grew up on a cattle ranch. Old Nancy. Did you know that? I want to share with you the success story from the Lindamood-Bell learning processes. This is from a parent with an eight-year-old son diagnosed with autism. Here's the letter.</p><p>\"David was diagnosed with autism and struggled with socializing, expressive language, critical thinking, comprehension. David started with an assessment at Lindamood-Bell and did an eight week intensive program. The staff at Lindamood-Bell was sensitive to our concerns and needs and gave us constant feedback. David has improved tremendously. Before Lindamood-Bell, his overall comprehension was at the ninth percentile. After his retest at Lindamood-Bell, he was at the 70 percentile.\" That's unbelievable, isn't it? Call them at 800-300-1818 or go online at lindamoodbell.com.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Johnson &amp; Johnson, today, is going to announce a powerful new cancer test that it wants to put on the market. It's a blood test. It is billed as being able to spot a single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells. J&amp;J teaming up with scientists who invented the test to make it cheaper and better. And their hope is that the blood test can take the place of more invasive cancer tests.</p><p>Stocks starting off the new year with gains. The data out of China is being seen as a positive for the market. It showed manufacturing slip for the first time in five months, but what's that doing is it's easing some inflation concerns. And Europe has been up all morning long. London closed today because of the New Year's holiday. But Paris up 2 percent. Germany up 1.25 percent.</p><p>Here in the U.S., stock index futures indicating a higher open a little over an hour from now on Wall Street with the Dow futures up by 90 points. And a quick look at commodities as well. The oil price is around $92 a barrel all morning. And gold, after being lower, is now up over $1 at $1,422 per ounce.</p><p>All right. The IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right now here at the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Twenty-six after the hour as we continue to get behind here. But it's -- we're getting everything in, so that's more important than anything else, I guess. So, it's time for a little business news again. Here with that, Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>From getting behind to going up, gas prices. The national average for regular unleaded is already $3.07 a gallon. It's going to head back to near $4 a gallon by the spring according to many experts. It should be the second highest year on record in terms of prices. Let's hope it doesn't get back to $4.11 a gallon. That was a record hit in the summer of '08.</p><p>And, by the way, if you're interested in how Shania Twain's life develops with this new husband, who's the ex-husband of the woman who broke up Shania's marriage, she's going to have her own show on the new Oprah Winfrey Network later this year, I believe, called \"Why Not?\" with Shania Twain.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. So you can keep --</p><p>IMUS: Do you have a picture of the husband? Because she's cute.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's cute. Do we have a picture of their wedding?</p><p>IMUS: No, of him?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, well, of him.</p><p>IMUS: You were telling me how hot he was.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's got -- well, he's got curly -- he's got curly hair and it kind of has a little bit of a mullet if memory serves. He's pretty cute. He's better looking than Mutt Lange, I'll put it that way.</p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash deal on that, isn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, brother.</p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash trailer park situation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but you get to watch it for free, though, when you watch it on the TV. That's -- or you can come over to my house, which I don't think you want to do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. How did that go, by the way, over the holidays at your house?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was all right. I got trapped in the house with six adults, three kids and three dogs. And one of the dogs, being a four month old border collie puppy. So that was a good time.</p><p>IMUS: Who were the adults?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mama, daddy, brother, his wife, Jonas and me. If you could call us all adults.</p><p>IMUS: How is your brother's wife? How do you get along with her?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I adore her.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you do?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. We get along good.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, that's too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Well, we'd just like a little friction and stuff going on. So there wasn't any animosity that bubbled to the surface there or any long held resentments or anything?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I wasn't happy with -- no, I wasn't happy with my Christmas gifts from Jonas. But other than that.</p><p>IMUS: What did he get you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Underwear that he bought -- I know he bought on sale because I saw it on sale on the Internet. And a computer, a laptop, which is just business. I didn't want something business related. And I wanted underwear that fit that was nicer than what he gave me. So, I was mad. At least I didn't get those pajama jeans. I mean I can look on the bright side.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he didn't get you like them big ole granny drawers, did he?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some were, yes, large in size. Some, too small. There was no happy medium.</p><p>IMUS: He didn't' get --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was no happy medium. They were either to small and uncomfortable or they were too big and loose.</p><p>IMUS: So he didn't go the Victoria's Secret thong deal?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, he went on the Internet to one of these private sales sites and bought drawers on sale.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he got you some -- he got you some of those Hanes -- big old -- them Hanes big beefy drawers.</p><p>MCCORD: Off of eBay.</p><p>IMUS: All right, time for a Bernard McGuirk briefing, a \"Bernie Briefing,\" sponsored by -- these big old beefy drawers.</p><p>MCCORD: That ain't right.</p><p>IMUS: Sponsored by P.C. Richard &amp; Son. A hundred and one years they've got it going on. Still going on.</p><p>What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, chief, on the \"New Year's Rocking Eve\" fright night, the TV shows, I confess I was one of the losers who was up at midnight watching. And I was watching Dick Clark --</p><p>IMUS: No, don't do this.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And -- well, no, no, this is -- this is a big story. There are competing, differing opinions as to whether or not Dick Clark should still be out there. Some people say it's an inspiration, but --</p><p>IMUS: No, no. It's too humiliating for him. Whoever is around him shouldn't let him do this. It's terrible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DICK CLARK, BROADCASTER: But don't you go anywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Where did that come from?</p><p>IMUS: I didn't hear the sound. There's no point in playing it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We have audio here. Lou will play it.</p><p>Here, Lou. Go ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARK: Thank you, Ryan, very much. Now, take a look at all the people up on Broadway. I don't know how people pull off this party year after year, but they do a whale of a job. And tonight it will be bigger and better than ever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Again, some people say that's inspiring, and some people say it's out of place. But in any case, he won the night far and away. He was the most watched show that night of all the broadcast and cable New Year's Eve shows. And God bless poor old Dick Clark.</p><p>IMUS: You bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: What?</p><p>IMUS: You evil bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why?</p><p>IMUS: You just can't --</p><p>MCCORD: Well, he shouldn't be going on.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I didn't put him on ABC.</p><p>IMUS: No, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I think he should be on. I think he is an inspiration.</p><p>IMUS: Put him on Fox. No. No.</p><p>MCCORD: He was just presenting the controversy.</p><p>IMUS: You put him on ABC. You can't be. You can't do that. It's horrible.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I happen to disagree. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a nice thing. And again, it inspires people who have been ill.</p><p>My dad had a stroke, he came back from it. It makes people say, yes, I can do it.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. Here he is on -- who is that Ryan Seacrest? Do you have any sound on that, Big Foot.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We have a little -- we have sound. Lou and I have some sound from Ryan Seacrest just before --</p><p>IMUS: Well, there's Dick and -- Big Foot, we can't hear any sound on this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe he doesn't want to.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN SEACREST: Sorry. Sorry, not my fault.</p><p>CLARK: Happy New Year.</p><p>SEACREST: Happy New Year. Great job.</p><p>CLARK: Thank you, Ryan. Thank you.</p><p>SEACREST: Thank you so much.</p><p>Dick Clark, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>Well, we are inside, and it's even warmer in here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a nice thing. The man's been through hell and back. Way to kick off the new year.</p><p>Charles, push him. Is he all right?</p><p>MCCORD: He's all right, but he's --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Looking to the future.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: You son of a bitch!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Tom goes for the easy joke.</p><p>IMUS: Call that funny, Charles?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good. Now everybody is --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Everybody is waiting to see who is going to say it.</p><p>IMUS: Tom.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, Tom, have you got that clip? Lou?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll he come up here and I'll find you. Are you coming down here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just got to e-mail from Neil Cavuto.</p><p>IMUS: That's not funny.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was down at the ranch last we week.</p><p>MCCORD: This is not -- stop.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not funny. It's not funny, no.</p><p>MCCORD: This is not good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not funny, Bernard. It's not.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Look, God bless Dick Clark, is all I'm saying.</p><p>MCCORD: There is an is inspirational story.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. That Ryan Seacrest, too.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCCORD: You've got to stop.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God.</p><p>MCGUIRK: \"Blonde on Blonde\" is coming up tomorrow.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: That's just horrible. God.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Imus at night -- be there.</p><p>IMUS: Why do they do that? That's horrible.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are they wheeling him out there?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, it's his show. He's as lucid as they come. He just can't speak properly. So why not?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the way he's going to go out though.</p><p>MCGUIRK: So what? That's his choice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it's not.</p><p>IMUS: That's not right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It was a ratings winner for the night.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't think it had much to do --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go see how he is?</p><p>IMUS: Do you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Ryan Seacrest. You had a bunch of great performers. Kesha was there.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Ryan Seacrest, if you get down and you -- I mean, I like him, but if you get down and you scrape the bottom of the show biz barrel, that's where you find Ryan Seacrest. I mean, he's on the E! Channel, for God's sake.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's \"American Idol.\" He's at the top of his game, that guys.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, whatever. He's at the bottom of the barrel. He may be at the top of the game, but --</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: And when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California Congressman Darrell Issa getting a big promotion. He'll become the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which basically means he'll be the one or heading up the committee that oversees the government.</p><p>And appearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Issa telling Chris Wallace he's going to target government spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: We have about $1.7 trillion worth of regulatory costs already in the government. If the president wants to throw another $300 or $400 billion, what he's doing is taking it right out of businesses, right out of employment, right out of competitiveness. We need to make sure we can compete.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings as committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also Medicare.</p><p>Checking in on the markets here this morning for you, up all morning long. And we are indicated higher on the futures by 85 points now on Dow futures. It looks like a strong start to the new year coming on Wall Street in just a little while.</p><p>It's the IMUS IN THE MORNING program that continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>IMUS: Twenty minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country, and on the Fox Business Network all over the world. Three new radio affiliates today -- WAUB, 1590, way up there on the right-hand side of the dial where the dogs can listen, and at 94.1 FM here in Auburn, New York.</p><p>MCCORD: But you can't.</p><p>IMUS: On WGBA, 1240 on the dial there in Geneva, New York, Finger Lakes News Radio. And KWKC, 1340 AM, in Abilene, Texas, Talk Radio 1340.</p><p>Tomorrow, on this program, Tom Friedman. Wednesday, \"Blonde on Blonde.\"</p><p>Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, our old friend, former assistant to the president, vice president, a bunch of other stuff, Mary Matlin.</p><p>Good morning, Ms. Matalin.</p><p>MARY MATALIN, FMR. ASSISTANT TO VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY: Here, kitty kitty. Hey. Good morning. Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Are you calling the cat?</p><p>MATALIN: Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty kitty. She was trapped outside and was about to unleash the dogs of my hell, my mini dachshund. I said, \"Kitty.\"</p><p>It irritates I-Man. He doesn't want to hear you.</p><p>IMUS: I like cats and dogs. What's your cat's name?</p><p>MATALIN: Witchy. She has one green eye and one blue eye.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you out of breath?</p><p>MATALIN: Because I had to move the chair, open the shades, and open the window from the bottom up, while I was holding the phone in my ear. And I'm old now.</p><p>IMUS: Did you -- what did you do New Year's Eve?</p><p>MATALIN: Made black eyed peas and cabbage and listened to WWOZ and had a glass of wine by myself.</p><p>IMUS: Where was James?</p><p>MATALIN: Was it after 9:00? If it's after 9:00, he's in bed.</p><p>IMUS: So did you stay up and watch the ball come down?</p><p>MATALIN: I listened to WWOZ, which is the best jazz in the world -- Irvin Mayfield, jazz play club on Bourbon Street live.</p><p>IMUS: Radio?</p><p>MATALIN: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you didn't make that clear.</p><p>MATALIN: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I should know everybody doesn't know WWOZ. But if you don't, you can get it live streaming. It's the best jazz.</p><p>IMUS: Because Bernie just played a cut of Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve in which Mr. Clark was on. And, of course, he's had a stroke some years ago.</p><p>MATALIN: Yes, I saw it on, and I have to take Bernie's side as I do on most things on this. I thought it was an inspiration.</p><p>IMUS: You thought it was an inspiration?</p><p>MATALIN: I guess you don't.</p><p>IMUS: Well, an inspiration to who?</p><p>MATALIN: Just what Bernie said. If you've been -- if you've come back from something that -- a disease that people -- or suffered from something that would normally render you hidden away for whatever reason, and you can come back, that's an inspiration to others who are similarly afflicted. Heart disease or cancer or anything, you can talk about it and show people that everything is workable, and life is worth living.</p><p>IMUS: Does she have a point, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, and a point that it need not be in all cases the end and --</p><p>MATALIN: Or it can be a different reality.</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly. And Mr. Clark is a textbook example of that.</p><p>IMUS: Well, but my problem with it is --</p><p>MCCORD: What?</p><p>IMUS: -- is that whenever it gets played on this program, and the reason that it's intended to be a source of amusement, that's the problem.</p><p>MATALIN: So it's not -- so, as always, it's always about you. This is about what, is that you're saying? You didn't like it?</p><p>IMUS: Well, guess what? It's 2011. Suddenly, it's not going to be about me this year. Well, of course.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATALIN: This is your new New Year's resolution?</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but I don't know --</p><p>MCCORD: It could be about him a few years down the road.</p><p>IMUS: I just don't -- I don't know. I feel bad for the guy and I don't think it's funny. I mean, you can make it funny. They did make it funny, Bernie and Lou, of course, and Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: You made it funny.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MATALIN: You made it funny. Bernie made it about --</p><p>IMUS: Then they made it about me, a window to the future.</p><p>MATALIN: You invited it. You invited it by being so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I don't invite the ridicule that I constantly get on this program.</p><p>MATALIN: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p>MATALIN: OK.</p><p>IMUS: So the Bush tax cuts, I guess, have been extended. What does that mean?</p><p>MATALIN: That means these rich bastards who don't need them, you know, are now going to get them.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why do you think the president did it?</p><p>MATALIN: Because he's -- he just wanted to screw his own guys.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MATALIN: No. None of the above.</p><p>IMUS: Well what then?</p><p>MATALIN: It's -- I think we -- he did it because he didn't want to be blamed for not doing it. And Larry Summers and everybody else came out and said that reality, which will give us a double-dip recession if taxes are affected in a recession.</p><p>IMUS: So you think it's going to have an impact on the economy?</p><p>MATALIN: I think the opposite would have had a severe impact, a better impact --</p><p>IMUS: That's not what I asked you.</p><p>MATALIN: Well, these aren't yes or no questions.</p><p>IMUS: Well, answer it as best as you can, as you're capable of.</p><p>MATALIN: I'm answering it.</p><p>IMUS: By opening the window and choking your cat.</p><p>MATALIN: One of the cats, the one that still has a tail.</p><p>A better package would have been to have no spending increases and leave the tax structure as it was, and leave the estate tax where it was so people don't make decisions upon -- about their final days based on their tax situation, which I think is immoral. That would have been the better package, but that's not what happened because politics --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Well, the rap we were hearing, Mary Matalin, is that if we gave the tax cuts to all these rich bastards and these other folks, that that would all -- that they would then invest in the economy and hire more people and all that sort of thing.</p><p>So, my question is, do you think that's going to happen?</p><p>MATALIN: No, that's the rap that -- that's -- the case for tax cuts as a stimulative economic policy do not --</p><p>IMUS: I like that phrase.</p><p>MATALIN: -- go to those tax cuts. That was maintaining a tax rate, the changing of which would have exacerbated recessionary problems.</p><p>Stimulative taxes -- not all tax cuts are created equal -- would have been further reductions of the top rates, a reduction in the corporate tax rate, eradication of corporate taxes loopholes and such, and tax reform, which the president's talking about. That's stimulative tax policy, not just keeping the same rates. So that's one of their canards.</p><p>And what would be most stimulative now is to continue to reduce or make some effort to stop spending and roll back the debt, starting with health care. So that will be the plan, and I hope they get some of it done.</p><p>IMUS: And your scummy Republican friends were shamed into caving in on the 9/11 Responders Bill.</p><p>MATALIN: In response to scummy liberals, who --</p><p>IMUS: And inspired quite a bit by Shep Smith (ph).</p><p>MATALIN: -- let it sit there for years and did nothing about it, and wait until it's Christmas Eve and lard it up. Yes, it should have been passed. It should have been passed two years earlier. There shouldn't have been anybody who had any problem getting any health care at any time from 9/11 on.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, that's a very good point.</p><p>Hey, how are things in New Orleans? You live there now, right?</p><p>MATALIN: We're going on year three.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MATALIN: This is our third year here. It's wonderful.</p><p>IMUS: Who is the new mayor there?</p><p>MATALIN: He's spectacular.</p><p>IMUS: Who is it -- huh?</p><p>MATALIN: He's going to be up in New York. He comes a lot. He's got a new police chief.</p><p>IMUS: What is his name?</p><p>Oh, I'm sorry. Mitch Landrieu, Mayor Mitch.</p><p>IMUS: Has he been indicted yet?</p><p>MATALIN: We used to -- half the state was under water and other half was under indictment. But we're not like that now. We're all cleaned up now.</p><p>IMUS: Happy New Year to you, the kids, him.</p><p>MATALIN: And Happy New Year. You'll never be -- you'll always be you, Imus. You'll just always be you.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let's hope so. Thank you.</p><p>MATALIN: Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Mary Matalin.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Here is the \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day. There was a glitch in the phone's alarm clock feature. Users who set their alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't go off when 2011 arrived.</p><p>An Apple spokesperson says the fix is in the works and all alarms will work properly starting today. But users in Europe and Asia saying the problem has not yet been fixed.</p><p>Vizio, maker of inexpensive flat-TV screens, is looking to expand. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell phones and tablet computers, and those two products, the Via Phone and the Via Tablet, will be introduced this summer. The announcement comes just days ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show taking place this week in Las Vegas.</p><p>And \"Little Fockers\" holding on to the top spot at the weekend box office.

He's here.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he is?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's unusual, because ordinarily he would stretch one of these New Year's deals into an extra week's vacation, but apparently he's not done that.</p><p>Gangsta Mickey is here, and so is Charles Rangel, neither of whom have been on this morning, but they will get on coming up.</p><p>It's five minutes now until the hour.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you looking at me -- with your mouth hanging open like a $2 suitcase?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Huh?</p><p>IMUS: Made you look -- huh? What's the matter?</p><p>POWELL: No, it's just another day at the home. That's what it is.

I wasn't eating, you idiot.</p><p>POWELL: Well, you freaked out about it though. It's like, \"Oh, my fork.\"</p><p>IMUS: I dropped it because I have this tea, and they have hunks of lemon in it.

I went to the Jets game yesterday, they won, 38-7. But you know that already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS: Yes, I don't care about the Jets game because they were already in the playoffs. So I don't care about the Seattle Seahawks and the Rams people, but I'll find out apparently from Warner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCSHANE: So one of them with - record made the playoffs. I'm being told in my ear, you want to know who won now or no?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS: No, let me find out from Warner, because, Warner likes to tell me stuff like that.</p><p>MCSHANE: It is Warner's job.</p><p>IMUS: Santa brought us a goofy tie? Is that what happened?</p><p>MCSHANE: No, I had that one already, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: The funny tie, under the tree.</p><p>MCSHANE: So you got two weeks off and that is the best you could come up with.</p><p>IMUS: That's all I could come up with.</p><p>MCSHANE: You sound great, by the way. How this is voice, good?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't have throat cancer, they tell me, but I do have -- pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCSHANE: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Yes --and, like if you had a colonoscopy and they find this -- remove them, so, these are -- they have to take them off with a laser here in a couple of weeks, and this is way too much information.</p><p>MCSHANE: I actually care. I told you, I care.</p><p>IMUS: I'll be fine.</p><p>MCSHANE: You will be OK, that is the main point.</p><p>IMUS: Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, and Mary Matalin coming up this morning. Three new radio affiliates - have you even seen that guy who does the red eye thing here on Fox.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Is he any good.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, sure. It's fine. I don't watch it. It is on in the middle of the night, but a lot of people like it.</p><p>IMUS: I saw him on the news with <person><nameText>Megyn Kelly </nameText></person>and -- too happy to suit me, but he seemed funny.</p><p>MCSHANE: He is pretty funny.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder if we should have him on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Sure, why not. Give it a try.</p><p>IMUS: Is he any good? He is good. You are saying that because we're on - - on TV, here, aren't you.</p><p>MCSHANE: That is why, yes.</p><p>IMUS: What is going on with business -- how this is Facebook deal, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, $50 billion valuation on Facebook. It's no joke right there.</p><p>IMUS: Please.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's what Goldman thinks it's worth anyway. I will get to that in a second, but thank you, I-man and good morning. First, let's bring up the markets and look up some numbers here because stocks are starting off the new week and the New Year with some gains here globally.</p><p>China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and if anything that's actually easing concerns about inflation and the Chinese market at the bottom screen is up 1-3/4 percent overnight.</p><p>Markets in Hong Kong and South Korea are also up, and Japan has not resumed trading yet in the New Year. Over in Europe, London is closed today for the New Year's holiday, but Paris and Frankfurt are both up significantly, Paris by more than 2 percent and our futures indicating a higher open on Wall Street as well up by 76 points on Dow futures, pretty good numbers.</p><p>Now as for the major indexes and how they fared in 2010, the Dow gained 11 percent, S&amp;P 13 percent, the Nasdaq the best performer of the bunch, 17 percent gain.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on more debt national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion ceiling and the White House Council of Economic Advisors, Chairman Austin Goolsbee on ABC's \"This Week\" saying it's crucial the ceiling is raised.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUSTIN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: This is not a game, you know, the debt ceiling is not something to toy with. That is the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that is the -- essentially defaulting on our obligations, which is unprecedented in American history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree it does need to be raised but, many of them are also saying they will not go along with it unless they get promises to change Washington's spending habits and argue there is no point in having a debt ceiling if they raise it every time the national debt gets close. Now here's the story that the I-man was referring to a moment ago.</p><p>Goldman Sachs investing $450 million in Facebook, according to the \"New York Times.\" A Russian company also buying $50 million worth of Facebook's stock. \"The Times\" says these deals value Facebook at $50 billion. Now, as we have reported the FCC now looking into secondary market trading at Facebook's privately held shares.</p><p>Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its web site, the latest development in the conflict between airlines and online travel agencies, since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says Expedia intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results. American is looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own web site and every effort to save money. Expedia says the move will only cost them ticket sales and believes Americans' efforts are bad for travellers.</p><p>All right, let's take a live look now at commodities this morning. The oil price is above $92 per barrel and gold is down by a dollar per ounce.</p><p>Coming up, a little bit later on in the hour, Bo Dietl will be the I-man's guest as IMUS IN THE MORNING does get started, right now, Fox Business, power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: Warner, who won the football game last night?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Seahawks, man, they finished 7-9. Win the division and are in the playoffs.</p><p>IMUS: So the giants, who are 10-6, they are not in the playoffs.</p><p>WOLF: You got it. No, you have to change the rule.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN: That is crazy.</p><p>WOLF: Absurd, yes.</p><p>IMUS: I will whip somebody's butt over there -- Charles and I.</p><p>WOLF: Now you're talking.</p><p>IMUS: Charles and me, yes. And, I get my grammar screwed up. Happy New Year, everybody.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Shucks.</p><p>IMUS: Bring you up on my medical, last time --</p><p>MCCORD: Let's have the latest.</p><p>IMUS: I'm had a biopsy -- let me say this about Mt. Sinai. It is a great hospital. You know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and Cornell and Mt. Sinai is a great hospital. The nurses are unbelievable and Dr. Peekaboo Woo, and Dr. Allen Reid, the anesthesiologist, are fabulous.</p><p>MCCORD: Good.</p><p>IMUS: They all did a great job and I apparently do not have throat cancer. What I have are these pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCCORD: Dysplasia, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Charles knows more about what I have than I do.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, they have to remove them with a laser, and, at a high level, and they would develop into --</p><p>MCCORD: Get rid of them, that is why we get rid of them.</p><p>IMUS: And you know how I got them? Smoking.</p><p>MCCORD: Really? That is what they say? OK.</p><p>IMUS: I haven't smoked for 15 years, but -</p><p>MCCORD: Listen to that, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, so I'm fine, Bo Dietl, Jerry Greenfield.</p><p>MCCORD: That's great news to start the new year.</p><p>IMUS: Bo Dietl, still have prostate cancer but, I think I do. I'm not sure anymore whether I do or not.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, may have defeated that.</p><p>IMUS: And, I came back from the ranch on Saturday.</p><p>MCCORDs: That's 700 miles an hour with the freaking tail wind.</p><p>IMUS: What a great vacation. It's 10 degrees. We have to go out there, because we run the place. It's 10 degrees -- the wind - there's not a ski resort.</p><p>MCCORD: How about that wind?</p><p>IMUS: The wind blows and I'm not exaggerating, 60 miles an hour. Anyway, Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, Mary Matalin, coming up and we have three new radio affiliates, and when I put my glasses on I'll tell you who they are.</p><p>I'm not going to do it now and, ratings came out in New York and for people -- the ratings are broken down, all kinds of demographics and I don't believe in them but I think they give you a rough idea, of you know - - I mean, you can -- like lit-fm or one of those -- hot 97 or one of these. Whoever these stations are, that do well.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And if it is consistent over a long period of time, like when stern was on terrestrial radio, you knew he was number one, and had been on a long time, a trend that remains supported, consistency.</p><p>IMUS: So, but on these 12-plus numbers they measure people by demographics like break it down to 12 to 18, 25-54, 18-34, it is ridiculous. Men, women, all of this and there's another one they do and it is just everybody who is 12 years of age or older. And, this program, the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, is the number 2 program in New York.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get out of town!</p><p>MCCORD: Shut the front door!</p><p>IMUS: Now, of course, I told Connell and Dagen that part of that, because, they are about the only new thing we have done here, other than I have a better attitude. They were partly responsible for that and then I got to thinking about it and if it weren't for them, we could have easily been number one.</p><p>MCCORD: Number one. Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'm sorry, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Which is the reason, when I got fired, and got the job at ABC I insisted on bringing Lou and Bernie, and Charles and everybody else, because, I knew without them, I would just be -- if it weren't for them, I would be on some station, in Jersey with Uncle Floyd.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Uncle Floyd!</p><p>IMUS: I'd be on Sirius satellite radio. Mel likes me, to give me a job for 50 grand a year. And sit there -</p><p>RUFINO: At UHF --</p><p>IMUS: The I-man's blues channel, Blues and alternate country on Sirius. But, as it is -- so the show -- I've never been number 2, ever. Not back when --</p><p>MCCORD: Your best ratings.</p><p>IMUS: Not back when I was. So I'm happy about that and it is a great program. It's a better program than it ever was. Having very little to do -- not being self-effacing, having we little to do with me, Bernie, Lou, they are all great. Time for a little news and here with that is Chuck McCord. Good morning, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Good morning, I-man. Speaking of the weather, the main highway between southern and central California, shut down, both directions, blowing snow and ice from another big storm. The grapevine area of I-5 closed indefinitely, winds gusting to -- reminded me, winds, gusting to 90 miles per hour in mountain areas, and still accumulating at elevations, as low as just 1,500 feet.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>says he is honored to sign the bill to provide aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks, and first responders, all of whom --</p><p>IMUS: You know --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: \"The New York Times\" did an article about the stuff that Jon Stewart, who as you know, I like, stuff Jon Stewart did about the 9/11 bill.</p><p>MCCORD: I saw it and all of that.</p><p>IMUS: And wondering if Jon Stewart was under Edward R. Murrow, which I would hope even Jon Stewart would be embarrassed about. But perhaps he's not or we don't know because I don't know him, but I would suggest -- and it has nothing do with anything, but until Shep Smith went on the rant that he went on, as a result of seeing Jon Stewart's show, which Shep said he did, and -- hey, big foot --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS: There's the famous rap that Shep Smith did, he was talking to somebody, and he referenced Jon Stewart, and he had seen the Jon Stewart show apparently the night before, there's got to be a way to find that, right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we'll find it.</p><p>IMUS: He was -- first of all, they are both terrific, both Stewart and Shep Smith is magnificent. Few better, in fact -- I don't know if there is anybody better, but it was a respond -- did you site, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. I did --</p><p>IMUS: Am I right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: On the money, a 100 percent.</p><p>IMUS: He was absolutely spectacular.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I happened to see that.</p><p>IMUS: And it seemed to me it was spontaneous.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Certainly seemed that way.</p><p>IMUS: And the boy seemed to be articulate to me and I have to play it for you. So I think that if you are a bunch of Republicans, I -- remember I had John Thune on and he was giving me some nonsense about -- didn't wanted to rush into it.</p><p>I didn't press him hard on that, not as much as I should have, and, you know, the -- I started to say to him, you know, don't want to rush into anything and, I hope we get it before all of these people die. So, people like Senator Thune, who I am no longer supporting for anything --</p><p>MCGUIRK: That may be premature. The Republicans -- they ended up saving $3 billion from that particular bill. That is what they were holding out for, eliminate --</p><p>IMUS: They weren't going to do it until they got shamed into it by Jon Stewart and by Shep Smith, I'm saying. And when Shep Smith attacked them, I'm sure they were thinking, that is our home boy there, at Fox.</p><p>I mean, I'm sure in their minds they are thinking if we lost Shep Smith we lost the country. You would expect Jon Stewart. I thought it was magnificent what he did, by the way, but you expect him to do what he did but you wouldn't expect Shep Smith to do what he did and if you lose him you lost everybody. I mean, I'm sure they are thinking that and go that the scared into passing it, didn't they, Bernie, talking about the money they saved, because you carry water for them.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's the fact. Chuck Schumer's bill was $7 billion and, the bill ended up being $4 billion and they saved --</p><p>IMUS: But they wouldn't have done anything, had there not been those two events, am I right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Perhaps, there's no way to conclusively prove that, but it sure seems that way.</p><p>IMUS: And let me ask you this, for everybody who thinks, Sarah Palin is a moron, and I would be one of them, would you would this country be any worse off today if she were president? Answer me that. Tell me. I'm waiting --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Checkmate for the I-man.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Because, at least -- think whatever you want to think about her, and think as I do, maybe, even. I don't know that I think she is a moron but she'd have sense enough to at least ask the people rather than get the same people bush had. But, this dope has been doing -- I mean, is he still on vacation in Hawaii, by the way?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. He comes back I think late today.</p><p>IMUS: And then, on I-25, out there in Santa Fe, when you go up to the ranch into Santa Fe, before you get into Santa Fe, there was a guy has a houses -- a lot of people have houses, a guy has a house, puts up these goofy billboards, a homemade billboard.</p><p>And, makes me laugh every time, they change and he's obviously a Hannity devotee or one of them and once he has had up there for a while. Where is the birth certificate? The hand lettered dopey sign, where is the birth certificate. Here's my question -- where is it? I mean, I'm not a -- obviously I'm not one of those --</p><p>MCGUIRK: A birther?</p><p>IMUS: Of course not. But, where is it?</p><p>MCCORD: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: Isn't the governor of ha walkers wasn't he screaming all about it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's claiming --</p><p>IMUS: Where is it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, let's see it. Clear this up.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, if the guy who is supporting the president -- which I would tend to support him, too, by the way. But I just say.</p><p>MCCORD: Let's resolve this.</p><p>IMUS: Why haven't we ever seen it or why don't they produce it, I can't answer that.</p><p>IMUS: It just adds fuel to these nuts.</p><p>MCCORD: Of course it does.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, 16 after the hour, taking way too much time with my nonsense, did you do any news at all? I interrupted you, 9/11 bill.</p><p>MCCORD: The James Zadroga bill has been signed by the president there in Hawaii, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Carly? Anymore coffee? She left --</p><p>MCCORD: I'll go get you some.</p><p>IMUS: She said what did Wyatt get for Christmas and I couldn't remember, horse stuff. She said, well does she still believe in Santa Claus?</p><p>MCCORD: And your reply.</p><p>IMUS: I said, well, I still believe in Santa Claus. Why wouldn't he? You know, 17 after the hour, Warner will do a little sports and before that, a quick business update, from Connell McShane here on the Fox Business Network and on the radio as well. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man. I'm talking about the markets here, as we start off the new trading year to the up side, after a pretty good year in 2010, stocks are up, globally, this morning.</p><p>News out of China that show the economy there slowing down a little bit, seen as a good sign because it eases concerns about inflation. Anyway, the futures are up. The European markets that are open are all up and the Asian markets were up, overnight as well.</p><p>Now, as for the year in 2010, the Dow ended the year, with a gain of 11 percent, the S&amp;P was up 13 percent, and the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, with a rise of nearly 17 percent, in 2010.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning and Dagen McDowell will be along -- you guys still have your show 11:00 a.m.</p><p>MCSHANE: So far, I believe, yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK, we'll start the year, brand new year with their show and they'll still do that and, that's good. Three new radio affiliates, WAUB at 1590 and 98.1 FM, out there in Auburn, New York and WGVA, at 1240, in Geneva, New York. Finger Lakes news radio, they call that.</p><p>And, KWKC, 1340, on the AM dial, down there in Abiline, Texas, talk radio 1340 and they joined the IMUS In The Morning line-up of stations around the country beginning this morning. Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man, well, completing the NFL picture, the playoffs last night, Seattle wins the NFC West with a record of 7-9. Come on!</p><p>IMUS: Who do they play, New Orleans?</p><p>WOLF: They'll play the Saints, yes, on Saturday. You have to change the rule here very quickly. You know, forget winning the division, if you have a losing record you are not in the playoffs. You take the team with the next best record, which would have been the Giants or the Bucks at 10-6.</p><p>Earlier, the Packers beat the Bears, 10-3. The Packers, 10-6, win the final wildcard. AFC, the Colts win the AFC South, on the 43 yard field goal, last play of the game, although the Colts had won it minutes earlier when the Jags were eliminated. Steelers, win the AFC. North Falcons win the NFC South so the playoffs are all set.</p><p>Packers, Eagles, in Philadelphia and Saints and Seahawks in Seattle, Jets and Colts in Indianapolis and the Ravens and Chiefs in Kansas City, yes, did you watch any of the bowl games?</p><p>WOLF: None.</p><p>IMUS: You know, I've watched them all, except I didn't pay any attention to them because they don't mean anything.</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: Including the one -- a week from tonight, Auburn and Oregon, you make me watch that.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I'll watch that.</p><p>IMUS: I won't be watching it. So, you'll watch that?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I will.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you be at Imus on Broadway, wouldn't you want to see that?</p><p>WOLF: A conflicting time.</p><p>IMUS: It is that night. It's already sold out, so, I mean -- I could try to get you in, but -- you don't express any interest, and every day you can go to some stupid movie and routinely get a half a chicken sandwich or tuna, whatever the hell you eat, a bottle of wine and go to the gym and, see a stupid movie, park in the handicapped zone and then, go to some idiot's Broadway musical or play of some sort and yet you won't come see Imus on Broadway. That is Monday night. You will watch the stupid game between Auburn and Oregon?</p><p>WOLF: No, forget that bowl game!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Too late.</p><p>IMUS: They got to get a playoff. They have playoffs, I mean, just stupid they don't have that. Don't you agree, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Absolutely, every baseball, basketball, college, hockey and -- everything, all have playoffs, except football.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking of Imus on Broadway, Colin Quinn, who stars in long story short, which I saw which is genius stuff, directed by Jerry Seinfeld, Colin now joined the line-up of Broadway musical shows that will perform Monday night at the Hard Rock.</p><p>MCCORD: Great.</p><p>IMUS: For the Imus cattle ranch for kids with cancer. And, the legendary emcee, which I exchanged e-mails throughout the past two weeks with, Dick Cavett is our emcee and that is worth going to see, to see him.</p><p>And I'll be there, just to introduce him. I wanted to thank our title sponsor, GMC and, one place you can go to look great, feel good and feel great and a GMC sales associate will show you the latest and greatest health and fitness products. Imus on Broadway, brought do you by GMC, which we're going to tape that -- probably -- are we going to tape it, big foot, or not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We'll tape it if you want.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know, I don't know, if you can or not. Anyway, Warner Wolf sports, sponsored by American-made Peerless Boilers and the new 96 percent efficient purifier series. You have any more sports, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: There's one more thing, listen to this, I-man the Grizzlies beat the slumping Lakers last night, in L.A., by 19 points. And after the game, Phil Jackson really took it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, behind early in the third quarter, on -- stupid plays, and, Kobe has to screw up, you know, the game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one, and takes the rest of the guys out --</p><p>WOLF: Wow. Kobe's screwing up the game. Phil Jackson. That is pretty harsh.</p><p>IMUS: You know who I have become a fan of now?</p><p>WOLF: Kevin Durant?</p><p>IMUS: No. The Miami Heat. I'll tell you why --</p><p>WOLF: Why, I-man?</p><p>RUFINO: Can't wait for this.</p><p>IMUS: Shut up, Lou! I'll tell you why.</p><p>WOLF: I wonder why.</p><p>RUFINO: Miami heat, good God!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Courageous.</p><p>WOLF: It has nothing to do with the fact they've won 17 out of the last 18 and 11 in a row.</p><p>IMUS: No. No. Because, something Magic Johnson said. He said, LeBron James is playing out of his mind, and he said it is time to stop booing him. He may -- you may be unhappy that he left Cleveland and the way he went about it but, you have to get over that. The guy is a great basketball player. So, they have got that together.</p><p>MCCORD: This is why?</p><p>IMUS: What's wrong?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why didn't he go to a team that didn't have a bunch of star players and elevate them as most great players do?</p><p>IMUS: Because that wasn't our plan. It's 24 after the hour. All right, Steven Stills is 66 years old today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Looking for an investment opportunity but not sure where to start? Check out Planet Fitness's -- what \"Inc. Magazine\" calls one of the fastest growing companies in America. Miami heat, God.</p><p>MCCORD: Pathetic.</p><p>IMUS: You shut up!

All right back now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on FOX Business, the power to prosper.</p><p>WILLIS: Tonight on \"THE WILLIS REPORT,\" he says Americans will be paying $5 a gallon for gas as soon as next year, I'll be joined by former president of Shell John Hofmeister for his scary predictions, tune in tonight and every weeknight at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time for \"THE WILLIS REPORT\" on the FOX Business Network, the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: All right.

His five favorite songs, the Allman Brothers, \"One Way Out,\" \"Jungleland,\" Bruce Springsteen, \"Give me Shelter,\" The Stones, \"While my Guitar Gently Weeps,\" the Beatles, and, \"Landslide,\" Fleetwood Mac, not a horrible list.</p><p>MCCORD: Peta.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>RUFINO: Peta Griffin.</p><p>MCCORD: Peta.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: This song sucks.</p><p>IMUS: Time for little business news and here with all that, on the FOX Business Network and on the radio as well is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm good, welcome back, good to see you, sound great, look even better.</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All righty. So, iPhone, the Apple in its iPhone seemed to fall down on the job during the first two days of 2011 when the alarms that some iPhone owners set failed to go off, leaving folks to oversleep, apparently, it was one time alarm settings, not the recurrent ones saying, Apple will not say what went wrong with it but, apparently it will be fixed from here on out. I gave my mama an iPad for Christmas.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you did?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and, she opened it up and it was sealed, bought it at the Apples store at Danbury Mall, it was sealed she opened it and it said Happy Holidays, Dennis Piper and Alan Rosenthal (ph). It was engraved by two Endodontists that worked in Norwalk, that was my mama's Christmas gift from us. She kept it though.</p><p>IMUS: I don't quite understand you. Did you Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The iPad was engraved by these two Endodontists who apparently given them to their staff or costumers and somebody returned it to the Apple store and exchange it. But Apple.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, they sold to you for.</p><p>MCDOWELL: .and they sold it to me at no discounted, I might add.</p><p>IMUS: What was the story then, the Apple store?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, Apple store, so, mama got a kick out of it. I thought it was appropriate, you know, Christmas gift, root canals, you know, spending time with your family, all kinds of seems, dove tell together.</p><p>IMUS: I thought she would have been offended that it didn't say Merry Christmas.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, no. She was probably offended by the fact we got her the cheaper one, see the Wi-Fi, we got her the one with where you can -- the AT&amp;T.</p><p>IMUS: That's the one you got to have, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Well, we chintz out on that, Merry Christmas, mama, that's it.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you take it back?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Too lazy, too much trouble.</p><p>IMUS: For your mama?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. She seems happy with it. She's fine. And, I only have to see her like twice a year, what she'll going to do about it?</p><p>IMUS: She's crying inside.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: She has to seem happy, so, she's happy that this marriage of yours is working out apparently, so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She's not happy I'm not living at home with three kids, single.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, and surprised. Thirty three minutes after the hour, time for a Bernie briefing sponsored by PC Richard and Son. And here with all of that is Bernard McGuirk. Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, chief. Well, like most of us during the break, we were either skiing in Switzerland or down in St. Barts, you know, lounging off of P. Diddy's yacht or something. So, we weren't paying attention to a lot of things. But over the break, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>apparently made a phone call as the I-man not doubt heard about to the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, and during the course of a conversation about something else, he mentioned to them that he was very happy that the owner signed their quarterback Michael Vick, who has been just tearing it up on the field, at least he was until a couple of days after this news came out. And he told him that he was glad, because a lot of ex-cons in society don't get a second chance, he was very happy for the success of Michael Vick and the fact that the guy gave him the opportunity and of course a lot of people really just can't believe that he made that kind of phony waded into this controversy unnecessarily.</p><p>IMUS: Plus he has a dog, doesn't he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Don't they have a dog?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's going to need a secret service himself now to protect him from the president.</p><p>IMUS: Michael Vick comes to the White House, well, that is unfair, that's not right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But yes, he does. And, of course, again as I said, that following Sunday, Vick played a terrible game. Not that the two had any connection.</p><p>IMUS: I don't see anything wrong with that. You don't think the president should have weighed in on it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, not at all. I think it's unnecessary again, it's just like the Beer Summit with the cop versus the Harvard professor. You just going to alienate a bunch of people, there's no reason that people now is going to take side, they'll going to hate -- if they needed a reason to hate <person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>this will give it to them, a lot of dog lovers, even though I agree, the guy deserves a second chance.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I don't know. That is working pretty hard trying to find something to wolf on Obama about.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I agree he deserves a second chance but the president should not.</p><p>IMUS: The president deserves a second chance, I'm going to give it to him now. You know, I shouldn't say this. But I actually feel like now, here in New York, we have a governor. I love David Paterson, that's sort of, I guess maybe that is not right. That's not right. Bo Dietl is coming up, we're going to talk to him. Actually, Santa brought you an extra ten pounds, huh?</p><p>RUFINO: Oh!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Thanks, Bernie. Bo Dietl is next. It's one of Peter Rodriguez's five favorite songs, Beatles.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCCORD: You think it, he says it. IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, time now for a business update, from the FOX Business Network, here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Your latest news update, starts with, this story about Facebook in the \"New York Times\" this morning, the report is Goldman Sachs is investing $450 million in Facebook, a Russian Company reportedly also buying $50 million worth of Facebook stock. Now, \"The Times\" is saying this deals value Facebook at $50 billion. As we reported, the SEC is looking into the secondary market trading of Facebook's privately held shares.</p><p>And Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its Web site, the latest development of the conflict between airlines and on-line travel agencies since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says, Expedia intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results. American is looking to push the consumers to buy tickets on its own Web Site, in an effort to save money. As -- there's a look at some of your top stories, more news coming up as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues, right now, with the check on the forecast.</p><p>SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast. You can see, we do still have rain showers here in the southwest, and snow showers in the higher elevations. Most of the U.S. is looking very clear, and as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain showers in New England along the coastline. The midsection, lots of sunshine, a slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis and as we look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to see many if any delays travel wise, because of the weather. Other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to the rain/snow mix. I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program, on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Eighteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Jeff Greenfield, CBS News, Mary Matalin, down in New Orleans, probably somewhere, they're both coming up, this portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by State Bank, real people, real solutions, statebankli.com. Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, for his regular visit, our old friend Bo Dietl, good morning, Mr. Dietl.</p><p>BO DIETL, FOUNDER, BEAU DIETL AND ASSOCIATES: Good morning and Happy New Year to you and your family, everybody of the Imus family, Happy New Year and it is a New Year and let's look forward to prosperity.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>DIETL: OK.</p><p>IMUS: So, you don't bet on football games anymore?</p><p>DIETL: I have not bet one -- or one football game. I don't have the money anymore where I used to come in. I used to roll in, it doesn't roll any more. I got four iPads because you showed me this, thank God for credit cards, I got this 64 gigabyte with the Wi-Fi for my four children there. And they all got one and, you know what, we lost a great guy last year, George Steinbrenner. Now, I can tell the story. George Steinbrenner did for me like nobody else did for me. My daughter, Dana, who is the -- as a senior at the University of Tampa, at first when she tried to apply there, they only accepting a thousand students and her average was about 3.2, they told her, you have to go to another college and matriculate, she starts crying, dad, I wanted to go there, I wanted to go, I called Brandy Levine and asked Mr. Steinbrenner if he could maybe possibly help her get in. Mr. Steinbrenner got back to me and says, help her get in. Two days later, he was accepted into the University in Tampa. She now has a 4.0, she's on the Dean's list, honors society and she might become the valedictorian for the University of Tampa, my daughter Dana, I'm very proud.</p><p>IMUS: Pretty good, huh?</p><p>DIETL: And George Steinbrenner did it and my love out for the Steinbrenner family, a lot of people don't realize what he does. I sent him.</p><p>IMUS: Why did she want to go there?</p><p>DIETL: No. She's graduating.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, why did she want to go there?</p><p>DIETL: I don't know. It became like a kind of these kids get into a fad like all the friends are going. And then they all want to go -- at the high school, they all want to go. It is a very good school, she's doing teaching of disabled, you know, speech therapy, that kind of stuff, to teach people how to speak, she probably have to.</p><p>IMUS: Should have started with you?</p><p>DIETL: Yes, I know. I knew you were going to say that.</p><p>MCCORD: Is she adopted?</p><p>DIETL: Take it easy. No, she looks just like me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>She looks like just me, but.</p><p>IMUS: Your daughter looks like you?</p><p>DIETL: Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, you know what? Put it this way, they look like a very good-looking version of a fat old man like me.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you are not an unattractive man but...</p><p>DIETL: Yes, so...</p><p>IMUS: Not as much an extra ten pounds but...</p><p>DIETL: All right. Well, you want to know something? I eat. I don't eat lamb's regurgitations and all that stuff like you do. Now, over the holidays.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you don't have cancer like I do.</p><p>DIETL: John Mariotti, it's called \"The Chinese Conspiracy,\" this book is for you.</p><p>IMUS: No, don't give to it me. I won't read it.</p><p>DIETL: OK.</p><p>IMUS: I don't want it.</p><p>DIETL: OK. Well, can I talk about it? Because it's a great novel.</p><p>IMUS: Talk about what you want.</p><p>DIETL: OK. \"The Chinese Conspiracy\" by John Mariotti is a new novel that is out but the novel is based on a lot of facts. We know what happened with the Pentagon, with the breaking into the Supernet computers and all of that kind of stuff, the Chinese.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>DIETL: But this talks about a group of young Chinese guys that wanted to overthrow the old Ancient guard of China. So, what they do is they infiltrate all of our systems, all of our technologies systems, our grid and everything, and they shut down, they shut down the American -- all the IT., all the planes.</p><p>IMUS: What happens?</p><p>DIETL: What?</p><p>IMUS: How does this happen that somebody gets this -- do you know this guy?</p><p>DIETL: I don't know this guy but I'm going to tell you something.

Why can't I have a little, a little show time here? You have all these other guys, these guys that ran away from you, I stand by you! I'm loyal! So, listen to me, once in a while!</p><p>IMUS: All I asked you...</p><p>DIETL: Great book.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, when I got fired, you were going on all of those shows running your fat mouth. I had to -- I had to tell you to shut up, you were talking too much.</p><p>DIETL: I went on with that.</p><p>IMUS: I had to get you to shut up! You were going around quoting me, saying stuff that I never said. I didn't want you to stick up for me, I didn't need to be stuck up for. I didn't want people going around and making any excuses for me. There wasn't any excuse, there is no excuse now. Your mic has been off for five minutes -- a minute.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DIETL: You sit on the board of the directors, you shouldn't be talking about.</p><p>IMUS: Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute.</p><p>DIETL: OK.</p><p>IMUS: All I wondered was, I'm sure the book is fine.</p><p>DIETL: It is great book because...</p><p>IMUS: Fine.</p><p>DIETL: .it is based on fact.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCCORD: He just had a simple question.</p><p>IMUS: I just wonder how you happened -- it happened to come to your attention. Who gave it to you, some friend of yours?</p><p>DIETL: He's a friend of Admiral Straw.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>DIETL: And I was at the Army-Navy game and he has a hat like you wear.</p><p>IMUS: That's not a hat like I wear.</p><p>DIETL: Well, it looks like some.</p><p>IMUS: No, it's not.</p><p>DIETL: All right. OK. And he signed you the book, I'm going to tell you about something, you talk about novel.</p><p>IMUS: He signed the book to me because he wants me to plug the book.</p><p>DIETL: No, you don't have to.</p><p>IMUS: Which I'm not now going to do, because I'm so offended that you attacked me.</p><p>DIETL: I challenged you to read this Don, because it is based on the facts about them taking over.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I'm sure it's fine.</p><p>DIETL: Taking over our country, stopping all our airlines, all our aviation, all our grid, all of that. And we talk about it all of the time.</p><p>IMUS: And your iPads all work...</p><p>DIETL: No. No. No. I got the ones that Wi-Fi. Do you got a Wi-Fi? Can you go on the train and catch a Wi-Fi in 3G?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>DIETL: No, you can't. That is 64 gigahertz.</p><p>IMUS: Of course, why would I buy something else?</p><p>DIETL: Because they didn't have the 64.</p><p>IMUS: Of course they did.</p><p>DIETL: That was only 37.</p><p>IMUS: This is Wi-Fi, also AT&amp;T.

Coming up on five minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I was telling Charles Rangel and the Gangster Mickey that I don't weigh myself very often, occasionally I do. I weighed myself this morning and I'm about, I'm not quite 6 feet tall and I weigh 153 pounds. But because of the way I wear my wranglers, if I weigh 153 pounds and not 150 pounds, I can't get them on. So, it was just my struggle this morning.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Jeff Greenfield.</p><p>MCCORD: A lot of issues.</p><p>IMUS: And Mary Matalin are both coming up, Gangster Mickey and Charles Rangel, all that, just ahead.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS, IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Hard to get on with the depends.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: Hard to get on over the depends.</p><p>IMUS: What did you say?</p><p>BARTLETT: Hard to get on over the depends!</p><p>IMUS: Did I tell you what happened, I e-mail either one about Wyatt's horse?</p><p>BARTLETT: No.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God. This is a horrible story. At the ranch, he gets up at 5:00 in the morning, to go out at the barn with the cowboys, and they feed all the animals. Colder than hell, it's just miserable. So, the Sunday after Christmas, there wasn't anybody there, so he does it. Even though he's only 12, he can still drive the feed truck, I mean, so we bought him his roping horse, buster, great roping horse, potentially great last summer. He goes up to the barn, he finds the horse dead in the stall.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, no.</p><p>IMUS: The horse actually out in the run -- there's (inaudible) runs outside the stall, some barns. Anyway, the horse is on his back with his leg stuck through the gate, dead. So, he comes back, running down to the house, screaming. You can imagine. His mother and I are asleep and I couldn't, I thought it was one of the dogs have died, I couldn't imagine it was his horse died. So, we buried it and put a little note in with it and oh, great.</p><p>MCCORD: It's hard.</p><p>IMUS: Between the animals and I.</p><p>IMUS: What did they -- hi, happy New Year. What did they do when I was gone, Connell? Did you and Dagen fill in?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. We did you know the old \"BEST OF IMUS\", had some live guests and also tossed to some of your segments, so yes it was Dagen and -- and me. We each took a couple days off around Christmas but we were both here for some of the days.</p><p>IMUS: You know actually, you guys are pretty good.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, thanks. Seriously?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, why?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, I'm just trying to say do you really mean that?</p><p>IMUS: Why you'd think we would have you on the program if we didn't think you were good.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right. That's true.</p><p>IMUS: We could be wrong.</p><p>MCSHANE: As I said to you in the e-mail, where would you be without me? Now that the rating is coming up and everything --</p><p>IMUS: We'd be number one and not number two.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes exactly.</p><p>IMUS: That where we would be.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's -- that was your response.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. Jeff Greenfield of CBS News and Mary Matalin, is I know what she's -- she's the former advisor to Darth Vader, Dick Cheney. And that's -- well, they are all coming up.</p><p>So -- anyway it's time for a little business news, and here to weary out with that is Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'll do my best. Good morning, I-Man.</p><p>Now, the markets here real quick for you this morning are really -- actually looking pretty good to start off the New Year with a survey that came out of China, that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months, but that has eased some of the concerns about inflation over there and markets around the world are higher.</p><p>We'll go to Asia, first of all and show that the Chinese market, the bottom of the screen, the Shanghai composite was up one and three quarters percent overnight; Hong Kong and South Korea -- those are the other markets on the screen -- were also up; and Japan has not yet resumed trading for the New Year.</p><p>In Europe this morning stocks are gaining ground; London is closed for a New Year's holiday but Paris is up almost two percent -- it was up more than percent earlier so it's off the highs; and Germany up by 1.3 percent. So a pretty good start to the day.</p><p>Now, our futures in the U.S. indicating the open on Wall Street, in two- and-a-half hours could be higher. We're up 64 points on DOW futures. And in terms of how we finished 2010, remember it was good year for stocks. I mean, the major indexes were higher, the DOW by 11 percent, the S&amp;P by nearly 13 percent and the NASDAQ, the best of the bunch, up almost 17 percent in 2010.</p><p>Now when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California Congressman Darrell Issa gets a big promotion.

And appearing on Fox News Sunday over the weekend, Issa telling Chris Wallace he's going to target government spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: We have about $1.7 trillion worth of regulatory costs already in the government. If the President wants to throw another $300 billion or $400 billion, what he is doing is taking it right out of businesses, right out of employment, right out of competitiveness. We need to make sure we can compete.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Now Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings, as committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also, Medicare.</p><p>We're starting off the New Year with a busy week on the economic calendar meantime.

Aren't they?</p><p>WOLF: Oh terrible, change the rule. Just because you win the division, nothing, if you have a losing record, you're out and you are replaced by a non-playoff team with the best record.</p><p>IMUS: Why because the Giants are 10 -- 10-6.</p><p>WOLF: Yes and as are the Buccaneers.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: I mean, the point is you want the best teams in there -- who cares - -</p><p>IMUS: Why are -- why are the Seahawks so awful?</p><p>WOLF: Well, the quarterback is no great shakes any more, Hasselbeck. The best player is Leon Washington, the kickoff return man they got from the Jets.

The fans -- or some of the fans did in a poll they took, didn't want them to win. Did you know that?</p><p>WOLF: No, well they bet on the rain --</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know what the deal was.</p><p>All right, six minutes after the hour. And for the millions of you who of course can't function in life without knowing how I am --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- and -- and many of you who idolize me, which I -- I can understand.</p><p>MCCORD: Hell, the I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: -- because people in this country no longer have any taste. That's the reason. I'm more successful now than I have ever been.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCORD: And demonstrated by the ratings.</p><p>IMUS: Which -- which demonstrates the clear decline of our society as we know it.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh yes.</p><p>IMUS: But I had this biopsy on the 17th of December and that is why I was not here so, to determine if in fact these things I had on my vocal cord were cancerous. And apparently they are not.</p><p>MCCORD: Good.</p><p>IMUS: But I had it over at Mt. Sinai but Dr. Wu did the biopsy. He's a great surgeon, doctor, and another guy who is fabulous, is a -- is a guy by the name of Dr. Allen Reid, who is an anesthesiologist. Fabulous.</p><p>And you know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and -- and -- and also Cornell, but Mt. Sinai is a great hospital, starting with the nurses. And it was under general anesthesia, and what apparently I have are pre-cancerous cells. But -- but I got to thinking about it, all cells are pre-cancerous, aren't they, but some are farther along the road than others.</p><p>MCCORD: Certainly.</p><p>IMUS: So the ones that I have are as far along the road as you want them to get.</p><p>MCCORD: Before getting rid of them.</p><p>IMUS: Before getting rid of them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: So now they have to go on with the laser and laser them off.</p><p>MCCORD: \"Star Wars\" them off there like that.</p><p>IMUS: And which is according to Dr. Wu, who is a -- who is peek-a-boo Wu, who is fabulous by the way. It's an office thing, so -- apparently, I know that is too much information for you.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes it is.</p><p>IMUS: Apparently, I'm fine.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And my voice is a little hoarse, but --</p><p>MCCORD: Not horrible.</p><p>IMUS: Not horrible.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: Here's Chuck with the news.

One driver says it was in fact pretty bad.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We found out about 15 minutes after I passed the detour, so I could have saved myself a lot of time, but instead we spent an hour-and-a-half of gridlock and now we have to go right back where we came from, so I'm feeling a little silly about that.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: Winds were gusting to 90 miles an hour.

Why -- why and in that state --</p><p>IMUS: Aren't they about $90 trillion in debt?</p><p>MCCORD: I think, $96 trillion, in the last -- in the last estimate. But you're absolutely right.</p><p>IMUS: What a mess.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK: It will be bring your own booze and crackers.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes and brown bag in it.</p><p>IMUS: Well --</p><p>MCCORD: And the top Democrat says the President will work with the Republican Congress but don't -- that doesn't mean he's going to buckle to them.

They say this will be able to spot a single cancer cell among as many as a billion healthy ones. The health care company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the giant company says it will join scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital where the test was invented, to try to bring this thing to market within the next several years.</p><p>Researchers think the test has the potential at least to transform care of many types of cancer, especially breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer. Doctors hope to use it to determine what treatment would be best for any particular tumor or set of tumors.</p><p>Magnitude 7.1 earthquake, southern Chile, yesterday, prompted tens of thousands to flee the coast for higher ground thinking that it might be generating another tsunami like the one that ravaged the area last year.

We'll get to that in a second first, let's check the business news and with that, Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Ok, good morning, I-Man.</p><p>The market coming up at 11 percent gain in 2010 at least for the DOW and nearly 17 percent rise for the NASDAQ, up again this morning indicating the New Year will start off on a good note.</p><p>Then, there's a big story in the \"New York Times\" this morning about Facebook, Goldman Sachs making a $500 million investment in Facebook according to \"The Times\" and a Russian investor also making a sizable investment and so the -- the value of Facebook according to these investments would now be around $50 billion.</p><p>So Facebook would be worth more as \"The Times\" points out, than big tech companies like eBay and Yahoo! and many others, but anyway, Facebook which has obviously been a hot company for some time is getting a big investment now from the -- one of the best known firms on -- or the best known firm on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: And the -- the two twins from Harvard who are -- the rowing twins out there in San Diego.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- who are suing what's his name?</p><p>MCSHANE: Zuckerberg.</p><p>IMUS: Yes they must be happy about this latest development.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, we'll see. Well, they want -- they want their suit, they settled it already for tens of millions of dollars but they want it now to be thrown out so that their shares can be valued higher but Facebook has won every legal challenge of that case which is of course the subject of the movie, the \"Social Network\".</p><p>IMUS: Well, the Connell McShane business report sponsored by Gorilla Trades. Get powerful stock picks for 30 days, sign up now at GorillaTrades.com. It's 14 after the hour.</p><p>Well, Charles had reported that the 9/11 responder bill was signed and \"The New York Times\" had what I thought was kind of an amusing article, particularly for those of us who are fans of Jon Stewart. I suspect Mr. Stewart probably thought it was amusing as well, but Bill Carter who writes all of these books about the late night wars as though somebody cares -- judging by the best-seller list, no one does.</p><p>Compared Mr. Stewart to Everett R. Murrow, which because of Mr. Stewart's rants about the Republicans, who wouldn't support the 9/11 responders bill and which I thought he was right about. But, I thought what made the Republicans come around, of course, Bernie's now claiming that they were able to get $3 billion out of the bill, so that they were -- so that they would pass it. But, whether they would have got that out or not, they were shamed into passing it.</p><p>But I thought when Shep Smith from Fox News was on Fox News, of course. And he had seen the Jon Stewart Show the night before. And so he was talking about it. And when -- he did this spontaneous wrap about how shameful it was that the Republicans were dragging their feet, refusing to pass the bill, and I saw him when he did it. And it appeared to be spontaneous but, in my view, the Republicans watching this could have endured Jon Stewart ragging on them and would have, because it happens all the time.</p><p>But, boy, I would be willing to bet when they turned on Fox News with the huge audience that they have and here's Shep Smith with his -- huge audience that he has. And they lost him, then they've lost the fight. Here's Shep Smith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Last night on Jon Stewart -- it was Jon Stewart's last show of the week and ok, we watched it, whatever. And he just flat on -- absolutely right and it's worth saying, who's going to hold these people's feet to the fire when we're able to put a 52-story building down there so far at Ground Zero.</p><p>We're able to pay for tax cuts from billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the economy but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire? Went down there to save people?</p><p>Did people know what the city was like that day; people walking over bridges, they were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying. Their family members were dead and these people ran to Ground Zero to save people's lives.

It's a shame and everybody who voted against it should have to stand up and account for him or herself. Is anybody going to hold them accountable?</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I think you just did.</p><p>SMITH: I'm not really in a position to do that.

And even if there had been they would have gone anyway. They just need a little bit of help.</p><p>It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do, doing anything for those people, don't we?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: That is Shep Smith, Fox News. That is big time -- tell me about Fox News.</p><p>MCGUIRK: With Chris Wallace.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Well, he's just sitting there, sucking his thumb --</p><p>MCGUIRK: You had brought that up with Chris Wallace prior to that conversation and then that following Sunday, Chris Wallace brought it up to several politician on his program as well.</p><p>IMUS: That is big time, Shep Smith. You know, and all the Lobster Newburghs of the world. Those of you who run around and won't watch Fox News --</p><p>MCCORD: Pay attention.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, pay attention. They're not doing that -- I didn't see Diane Sawyer doing that. I didn't see that wimp, who by the way won't be in the \"Profiles in Courage\" book, Brian Williams. I didn't see him or the little rodent over there at CBS doing anything.</p><p>Did you? Did you see any of them? Did they have a word to say about that? Who did have a word to say about it? Shep Smith.</p><p>So -- 19 after the hour. Get to Warner in sports in a minute. Calm down.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCSHANE: In the news this morning, Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its Web site. It's the latest development in this conflict that has been growing between the airlines and on-line travel agencies since American cut ties with Orbitz. The airline says Expedia intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.</p><p>American is looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own Web sites in an effort to save money. Expedia says the move will only cost them ticket sales and believes American's efforts are bad for travelers. Well, there you have it.</p><p>Stocks starting off the New Year with some gains here after a monthly survey in China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and that's worked to ease some inflation concerns.</p><p>Over in Europe this morning, stocks are higher and London is closed for a New Year's holiday but both Paris and Frankfurt are gaining ground.</p><p>Our futures are also higher, ahead of the open on Wall Street which is coming a little over two hours from now. We're up 67 points on Dow futures.</p><p>And commodities, oil is up at $92 a barrel; and gold down, just slightly.</p><p>So, that's a look at some of your top stories and now over to Charles for more of this morning's top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: And they include today, Connell, this -- another big storm hitting southern California; snow and 90 mile-an-hour winds were reported in some locations and authorities have shut done the so-called grapevine portion of I-5, north of Los Angeles.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>signing into law the measure that passes -- that pays, rather, for medical care for first responders to the 9/11 terror attacks, New York, '01.

In the videos Captain Owen Honors and other crewmembers can be seen cursing and using anti-gay slurs among other things.</p><p>Those are some of the headlines as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues now right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty-five after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It's a prime example Bernard, of what I was talking to you about off the air.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right. Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: Idiot sales department (INAUDIBLE) -- they're all talking about it now. They write these commercials and the commercials are 90 seconds long, but they pay for 60 seconds.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So I read for 60 seconds and then I stop reading so I don't know what they want left in or out or who knows.</p><p>MCCORD: Essential information, right.</p><p>IMUS: And I want to help them out, one of them is for GNC, it's a great nutrition center, they're great.</p><p>I have no idea what they -- by the way, at this point if they're not on top of it and the stupid sales department at the radio station is not, then, I can't be worried about it.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Too much.</p><p>IMUS: And now I've got myself all worked up here and I was doing fine up to now.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Time for sports and here with that is the great Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Good morning. Thank you, I-man.</p><p>Well, completing the play-off picture last night, the Seahawks finishing 7- 9, beat the Rams 16-6; they win the NFC west. And as you said, even the Seattle fans wanted the Seahawks to lose so they would get a higher draft pick.</p><p>The Packers win the wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3. The Colts win the AFC south, beating the Titans, 23-20. Although they didn't know it at the time, they had already won it minutes earlier because the Jags lost. Steelers win the AFC. Falcons win the NFC.</p><p>And finally, I-man, MVP, there's going to be no question about it, Tom Brady finishes with 36 touchdowns and just four interceptions.</p><p>IMUS: How did he play -- he's playing better than he ever has.</p><p>WOLF: Ever, all-time. Not anytime.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>WOLF: Not every time --</p><p>IMUS: That will be fine.</p><p>WOLF: Not Greenwich Time.</p><p>IMUS: That will be fine. Time for a little business news now, oh, my God. And here with that is the girl with the purple dress on, purple rain, purple rain. Dagen McDowell -- good morning Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir. I was trying to get all gussied up for your return.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm glad you did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. At least I came back from Christmas with all my teeth because there's always that danger.</p><p>IMUS: How would you lose your teeth?</p><p>MCDOWELL: A fight, fall down or there's always that, you know, peanut brittle sitting around the house.</p><p>IMUS: Or Santa come down that chimney and you're there under the tree and haven't been rubbing that Chamonix on yourself and so Santa would be disappointed, wouldn't he? And look like you been left out in the rain, girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He would punch me -- would punch me in the mouth.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let's hope not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: For not keeping my skin soft and supple.</p><p>IMUS: Well, anyway, what's going on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. The movie business was boo -- bad last year. Overall attendance was down more than 5 percent; the lowest number of tickets sold to the movies since 1996. Now, total revenue was north of $10 billion because ticket prices are higher. People are going to 3-D movies, which cost more money, but one, one notable disappointment was that Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolie movie \"The Tourist\" at end of the year. So, I reckon paying have gotten tired of paying to see that hussy with the puffy lips stand around.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you offing (ph) on her.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: You don't like her --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't. No, not at all.</p><p>IMUS: You know who seems kind of cute is Reese Witherspoon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, that movie didn't do so well either; that new movie that she's in.</p><p>IMUS: She's going to marry her agent, you know. Did you know that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Yes, I did. Jim Toff (ph) is his name, by the way.</p><p>IMUS: And how about Shania Twain?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Getting married to the ex-husband of the woman that Mutt Lang, Shania's ex-husband, left her for. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Now, that's a trailer park --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RUFINO: I'm my own grandpa right there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you know what? That's why you got to love her.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. All's well that ends well. She grew up hard knocks, man. Now she's found love.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, I know she did. Yes. I thought she's good. I've always liked her, but the girl -- she married Mutt Lange who produced all her records.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And he -- didn't he produce Def Leppard for a long time?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, he did.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Foreigner.</p><p>IMUS: Foreigner. So he's a great record producer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: But apparently that wasn't enough and she wasn't enough. So he was having an affair with her assistant, right, or his assistant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. She was like the house manager, I thought, something like that.</p><p>IMUS: OK. And so, Shania, of course, found out about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it was Shania's best friend.</p><p>IMUS: And Shania's best friend. Sure.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: So he was always there, that's unfortunate. So now, are they married now?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know if they're married.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now, but that woman's ex-husband, they are married, OK. Mutt and the woman -- Mutt and the woman are married and the woman's ex-husband just married Shania.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel dizzy right now.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: Now, Shania, she's down in Nashville. There's a bunch of people available, a bunch of these good looking cowboy singers. And I just, I just didn't understand that. That's sort of screwed up, isn't it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, he's hot.</p><p>IMUS: He is?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The guy she married is smoking, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's like -- yes, he's European looking. He's --</p><p>IMUS: He's cute?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, all right. Well, never mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And those cowboys will cheat on you quicker than they'll sneeze, so why drive down that road again?</p><p>IMUS: Well, Mutt Lange is not a cowboy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know, but the cowboys will cheat, too. Find a man who will stay honest to you.</p><p>IMUS: Like Tim McGraw, he married, down the road with what's her name. Figure, well, why not, so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What a tough decision for him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Faith Hill or hmmm -- I wonder --</p><p>IMUS: Years ago -- years ago, my brother and Phil Sweet wrote a song called \"\"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You, which eventually went to number one. It won the Music City News Record of the Year, country record, and is recorded by Jim Ed Brown of The Browns, you know. And Helen Cornelius.</p><p>Now, Helen, she was married. Well, you know where this story is going. And so was Jim, he was married. But they get this big hit record \"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You\", I don't want to have to say I do. And so they're on tour and they're on the bus and they discovered some -- one of them, one of the husbands or either her husband or his wife discovered that between the two compartments on the bus where Jim Ed Brown would sleep and where the other compartment where old Helen was asleep, there was a trap door.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: No way.</p><p>IMUS: There's like a, where your dog comes in and out. So one of them was wiggling through the trap door.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, for crying out loud.</p><p>IMUS: I don't want to have to marry you.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. I don't have to go through that trap door.</p><p>IMUS: Man, oh, man.</p><p>All right, 33 after the hour. Jeff Greenfield is coming up. But first, time for a briefing sponsored by our friends at P.C. Richard &amp; Son. And here with that is Bernard McGuirk.</p><p>Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yo, chief. Well, a lot happened since the break began for us a couple of weeks ago. The Bush tax cuts extended, \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" repealed. The death panels are back and Obamacare and the blizzard of 2010 further revealed Mayor Mike Bloomberg could be the arrogant schmuck we all knew he was.</p><p>IMUS: Two best news. The \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and the 9/11 responder bill.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. That was signed just yesterday by the president in Hawaii, robbing Chuck Schumer of his moment in the spotlight. He couldn't be there at the signing. However, before all this happened, Larry King signed off and during that show, a funny thing happened while Larry King was interviewing Bill Clinton which pretty much went unnoticed. They were talking about both being heart surgeon patients, members of the \"zipper club\" but that was a little confusing. But here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOICE OF: LARRY KING, HOST, \"LARRY KING LIVE\": You look well fit. Are you feeling well?</p><p>VOICE OF: BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I feel great. I've been traveling quite a bit, but as you pointed out I just got back from Haiti. And I'm kind of like you, I have to keep working. I don't know if it keeps me young, but at least it keeps me out of the grave.</p><p>KING: We're both in the \"zipper club.\" By the way, the suits want me to remind you what the \"zipper club\" is. It's if you've had open heart surgery, they have to zipper it up. So I thought everyone in the world knew it but apparently --</p><p>CLINTON: I'm glad you clarified that.</p><p>KING: I see what you mean. Oh, oh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: The big dog acknowledging and can be self-deprecating at this point.</p><p>IMUS: Of course, we lost a character when Larry -- what's Larry going to do now?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, he's still going to work. He's going to be a contributor.</p><p>He better, right. He has to be.</p><p>IMUS: Wasn't he ragging on Hannity and Rachel Maddow?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He did somewhere. I read something about that. He was --</p><p>IMUS: Both of them were kicking his ass, by the way. Hannity by a lot and her by some.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Hannity drove Larry King off the air, essentially.</p><p>IMUS: So he gets on. He's bad-mouthing Rachel Maddow and Hannity who were both killing him.</p><p>All right, Greenfield is next. Twenty-five until the hour.</p><p>MUSIC: Oh, I love the clothes she wears and the way the sunlight plays upon her hair. Oh, I hear the sound of a church bell off the wind that lifts her perfume through the air. I'm picking up good vibrations. She's giving me the excitations. I'm picking up good vibrations.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm so irritable this morning that I just don't know if I can recover.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: The bailout program for boring radio.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the FOX Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: All right. Here's your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>As many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's day, there was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock features. Users have set their alarm for a single wakeup. Found it didn't go off when 2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all alarms will work properly starting today. But apparently users in Europe and Asia say they are still having some problems.</p><p>Vizio, the maker of inexpensive flat-screen TVs looking now to expand. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell phones and tablet computers. The two products, the Via Phone and the Via Tablet will be introduced this summer from the company. The announcement comes days ahead of the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.</p><p>As for the markets this morning, let's check in on the futures once again. They've been higher all morning long. Dow futures now up by 84 points as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p>SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning. I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast.</p><p>You can see we do still have rain showers here in the southwest and snow showers in the higher elevations. Most of the U.S. is looking very clear. And as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain showers in New England along the coastline. The midsection, lots of sunshine. A slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis. And as we look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to see very many if any delays travel-wise because of the weather, other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to that rain- snow mix.</p><p>I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Nineteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Mary Matlin is coming up. Tomorrow, Tom Friedman. And then on Wednesday, Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus, \"Blond on Blond.\" This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by Time Warner cable business class. You first, the technology follows.</p><p>Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from CBS News, Jeff Greenfield. Good morning, Mr. Greenfield.</p><p>JEFF GREENFIELD, CBS NEWS (via telephone): Good morning, Don. Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Happy New Year to you. I apologize for being late.</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know, it's -- I mean, I would not have missed the conversation about all those country stars and their lives for anything. So it was fine, you know?</p><p>IMUS: I sense a note of sarcasm in your voice.</p><p>GREENFIELD: No. Me, on this show? Don't be silly.</p><p>IMUS: It just hurts my feelings because --</p><p>GREENFIELD: No, you are the audio version of Oprah's new network. Nothing but good feelings.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder how that's going to work out for her.</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know, I don't know. It's in a way unprecedented that an entire network is built around the appeal of one person although she's hardly, you know, your ordinary figure. And I guess it involves everything from whether or not some of her viewers are going to want to pay the extra fee. She's not on pay cable, but on a lot of network, a lot of cable systems she's not on the basic cable. There is some fluff about that. And the real question is, I guess, can you sustain 24 hours based on the world view of one person although as I say in her case that's just one extraordinary media figure. I mean, she certainly has built something over the years that is just unprecedented in, you know, media. So good luck to her.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I like her. I don't know why I like her. I don't watch her show, I just like her.</p><p>GREENFIELD: She's a -- I can say -- I think, I think you don't connect at that level with so many people at that level of intensity unless there's something there, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe Barbara Walters should have asked her if she was a lesbian?</p><p>GREENFIELD: I don't know, Don. Let me take that under prayerful consideration.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder what you thought. I didn't so, I like Barbara Walters, too.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, OK.</p><p>IMUS: So the 9/11 responders bill is signed that finally, huh?</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, and I think you were very wise in showing that clip from Shep Smith, because I think between him and Stuart, you had -- I think Shep is a straight arrow newscaster, but certainly the FOX Network is watched overwhelmingly by folks of a conservative persuasion and Stuart's show is watched overwhelmingly by folks with a liberal persuasion. When you have people on both sides coming at that issue and basically saying shame to the people who voted against it, I think those twin factors played a big role in getting that bill through.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know if many Democrats watch FOX News somewhere?</p><p>GREENFIELD: No, they do, because, first of all, FOX News as a cable network is by far the most watched cable network, and it isn't that Democrats don't watch it. But in the surveys that I have seen over the years and it shouldn't surprise anybody, the predominantly majority view of those who watch tends to the right. It's just the predominant view of those who watch MSNBC tends to the left. And this is about reassurance and reaffirmation of what you believe is right.</p><p>I may have told you the story. I talked once to a Democratic senator who told me that the television set is always on at MSNBC at home. And I said why after 12 hours of debate in the Senate, you go home and watch more politics? And the answer was, it's like soaking in a nice warm bath, you know. And I think that's true for a lot of people who turn on a cable news network, that basically tells them what you basically think that's right. And I think it's one of the reasons why my former places of business, CNN, had such a prime time ratings. There are a lot of others, but people basically I think, that is to say the people who watch cable news, and remember it's a big minority of television viewers. You're talking about three percent of, you know, television homes. Folks turn that stuff on either to be told they're right or in the case of, you know, Democrats watching FOX or Republicans watching MSNBC to get the blood going.</p><p>IMUS: I was so happy we were able to get you away from CNN over to CBS. I can't tell you.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, I'm sure you played your part.</p><p>IMUS: I hated the fact. Well, I kept saying to Rick Kaplan, who was a big fan of yours, by the way, as are a lot of people.</p><p>GREENFIELD: He's now one of my bosses. He's the executive producer of Katie Couric's show.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you be -- why wouldn't we get Greenfield over to CBS News and get him out of that hell hole over there.</p><p>GREENFIELD: The only thing I can tell you is the cafeteria at CNN was much better than the cafeteria at CBS.</p><p>IMUS: Did you watch the Rose Bowl?</p><p>GREENFIELD: I did, that's my alma mater.</p><p>IMUS: That's what I asked.</p><p>GREENFIELD: I thought it was a really good game. I was the only big 10 team that was competitive I think in all those -- how many bowl games are there now? About 35 quite literally?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD: So it's one missed field goal.</p><p>IMUS: That was my only connection to the game is I knew that you had gone to school there before you went to Harvard or Yale, wherever the hell you went.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, right.</p><p>IMUS: And that they were playing TCU. Of course, I was rooting for TCU, but that's just because I'm a big Texas fan. So --</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, Bob Schieffer is. In fact, I regretted the fact that he and I didn't get a bet down. Although now that Wisconsin lost, I don't know would have had to -- I don't know what I would have had to do, you know, appeared on the air in a TCU warm-up jacket. I guess that was a really good game and I must say that, you know, I didn't, I didn't call the University of Wisconsin in high dungeon and say no more contributions from me because you lost the football game. That's perhaps taking it a bit too far.</p><p>IMUS: If you're one of the people like I am who thinks that Sarah Palin is -- I don't know if I think she's a dope or not, but whatever. But let me ask you this, how much worse off would the country or better off would the country be where she president?</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know what?</p><p>IMUS: The answer is not --</p><p>GREENFIELD: First of all -- no, first, she's dumb like a fox. I mean, here's somebody who's turned the governorship of Alaska and an unsuccessful bid for vice-president into a multi-million dollar empire where she gets to talk only to people who like her for $100,000 a more pop, you know, is a favorite on the most watched cable news network in the country and makes millions of dollars selling books. This is how dumb she is.</p><p>IMUS: Very good.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, that's --</p><p>Two Cadillacs outside.</p><p>IMUS: You remember.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking of when people talk about how dumb he is, that preacher guy.</p><p>One of my favorite routines. But you know, that's a question probably better asked to people who -- who would ideologically tend to be on her side. I think it's really interesting that either a majority or maybe close to of Republicans don't think she's qualified to be president.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD: So what she has is an enormously intensely loyal base of people who like her and think any criticism of her is just an example of left wing media bias.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe it's a little like Oprah. We all like her but we just don't want her to run anything.</p><p>All right. I've got to go, but thank you very much.</p><p>GREENFIELD: -- that analogy completely, but I do think that she's going to have a significant role whether she's a candidate or not in 2012.</p><p>IMUS: All right. I've got to go.</p><p>GREENFIELD: OK. Well, Happy New Year and it's two months to start plugging my book like a banshee (ph).</p><p>IMUS: I will do anything for you. Jeff Greenfield, CBS News.</p><p>MUSIC: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: The stocks starting off the new year with some gains here. The monthly survey coming out of China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and that actually is easing some inflation concerns and some optimism about our economy as well, ahead of some key economic data points later in the week. Europe is up across the board. London is closed today for the New Year's holiday. And our futures are up across the board. The Dow futures ahead of the open on Wall Street now up almost triple digits. So we're adding to the gains as we get closer to the open.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants to put on the market. The blood test is billed as being able to spot a single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells. J&amp;J is teaming up with scientists who invented this test to make it cheaper and better and their hope is that the blood test can take the place eventually of more invasive cancer tests.</p><p>Goldman Sachs investing $450 million in Facebook according to the \"New York Times.\" A Russian company also buying $50 million worth of Facebook stock and as we've reported, the SEC now looking into the secondary market trading on Facebook's privately held shares.

It's the latest development in the conflict developing between airlines and on-line travel agencies. Since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says Expedia intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results.</p><p>As for the commodities this morning, we take a look at oil to see if it's still above $92 a barrel. And it is. And gold after being lower earlier has now turned slightly higher.</p><p>More news coming up at the top of the hour but it's IMUS IN THE MORNING that continues right now. FOX Business, power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: We got so far behind. So what are you saying now? We haven't lost Larry King?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So this is pathetic.</p><p>BARTLETT: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Can't you come up with something else? You're a professional comedian.</p><p>BARTLETT: I happen to come up with something else. He's a great character. You don't want to lose him.</p><p>MCCORD: He's still going to be around doing specials and stuff. He's just not going to have a show.</p><p>TONY POWELL: You're going to make him to do whatever --</p><p>BARTLETT: We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>BARTLETT: We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS: Well, yes, but that's different.</p><p>MCCORD: That's Nixon.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, it's Nixon.</p><p>IMUS: It's Nixon.</p><p>MCCORD: No, but you --</p><p>IMUS: You're saying we can still do Larry King?</p><p>BARTLETT: Why not? It's not like he's dead.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, he is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: But that's been for a while.</p><p>IMUS: He's a no-good bastard, by the way.</p><p>MCCORD: Who?</p><p>IMUS: Larry King. I used to be friends with him, but he's a creep. And his wife is a bigger creep.</p><p>POWELL: What are you saying?</p><p>BARTLETT: How about Rex Ryan?</p><p>IMUS: What about him?</p><p>BARTLETT: Him as a character.</p><p>IMUS: That's a weird dude, you know that.</p><p>BARTLETT: You think.</p><p>IMUS: No, but I mean, that toe-sucking thing?</p><p>BARTLETT: Well, that was, you know --</p><p>IMUS: Don't you think that's --</p><p>BARTLETT: I think what's interesting at first is the tripping controversy.</p><p>IMUS: And that girl got some fudgy feet, too, by the way. Did you see her feet?</p><p>MCCORD: Saw the photographs, yes.</p><p>IMUS: She should be wearing brogans.</p><p>IMUS: So I said to Carly (ph), how are you, happy New Year. So I say to Carly, I want a -- I'm drinking this tea that is supposed to kill cancer cells.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So -- and I'm happy to do it. So I said I wanted another cup. So she just brings over an empty cup, you know --</p><p>MCSHANE: Good for her. You deserve that.</p><p>IMUS: But I -- because I didn't specify what I wanted.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But it turns out we're out of the tea, so -- anyway, Seahawks won the football game last night, in case you just turned your -- whatever you have on, on. Your toaster.</p><p>MCSHANE: Your toaster.</p><p>IMUS: And --</p><p>MCSHANE: Seven and nine in the playoffs.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, which doesn't make any sense to me, but I don't care. So, are you a football fan, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, I'm a Jet fan. I was at the Jet game yesterday with my son and it was fun. And they won their -- well, they were already in the playoffs, but they won. So they go 11-5.</p><p>IMUS: Why would you pick a game to go to that meant nothing?</p><p>MCSHANE: Because you know why -- that's actually a good point. But we hadn't been to a game at the new stadium yet. So I decided on Saturday, the weather wasn't going to be too cold and he had never been to a game at the new stadium, so let's go. So we went.</p><p>IMUS: What kind of seats did you have?</p><p>MCSHANE: We had good seats. We were right behind -- they were actually in the second row -- they were technically in the 11th row but they were right behind the tunnel, you know, where the players run in. So they were in the second row behind that tunnel in the end zone and three of the touchdowns were right in our end zone, right where we were sitting. So it was pretty cool.</p><p>IMUS: Did you buy the tickets?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I bought them on -- I just bought them on Stub Hub the day before the game, online.</p><p>IMUS: Wouldn't there be some way, if you were going to go, you could -- you could let me know and then we could call Warner --</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And have you sit in the box with the owner?</p><p>MCSHANE: You know what, but then I'd owe you something.</p><p>IMUS: You owe me a lot now, by the way, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I do. Yes, I do.</p><p>IMUS: It's time for a little business news now and here is Connell McShane.</p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: I didn't want to add to it.</p><p>Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Now, let's look at the markets here this morning to see how things are starting off the week. Stocks -- starting off the year, really. It's the first trading day of the year with some gains. There's a monthly survey out of China that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months, and that's easing concerns about inflation. If you look at Asia, for example, the Shanghai composite, the Chinese market at the bottom of the screen, up 1.75 percent. Kospi in South Korea, Hang Seng in Hong Kong all up on the day. Japan has not yet resumed trading in the new year.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are up. London's close also today because of the New Year's holiday. Paris is up 2 percent. Look at that. Germany up 1.3 percent. And our futures indicating the open on Wall Street in an hour and a half is going to be significantly higher. Dow futures up almost triple digits, up 92 points.</p><p>All right. Now, in terms of how we fared last year, as it is, in 2010, there's the recap. The Dow up 11 percent. The S&amp;P almost 13 percent. And the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, higher by almost 17 percent.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on even more debt. The national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion ceiling. White House Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Austan Goolsbee on ABC \"This Week\" saying it's crucial that ceiling is raised.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: This is not a game. You know, the debt ceiling is not -- is not something to toy with. That's the -- the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that's the -- essentially defaulting on our obligations, which is totally unprecedented in American history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree that it needs to be raised, but many are also saying they wouldn't go along with that unless they get promises to change Washington's spending habits. They argue there's no point in even having a debt ceiling if it's simply raised every time the national debt gets close.</p><p>Bank of America taking a $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter. It's related to mortgages sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bank making the payment to Fannie and Freddie as part of a settlement over mortgages sold by Countrywide Financial. Now, Bank of America, remember, bought Countrywide three years ago and Bank of America shares are actually rising this morning on the news.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants to put in the open -- on the market. Now, the blood test is billed as being able to spot a single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells. J&amp;J is teaming with the scientists who invented the test to make it cheaper and better. The hope is that the blood tests can take the place of more invasive cancer tests.</p><p>And many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day. There was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock feature. Users who set their alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't even -- it didn't go off when 2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all alarms, they say, will be working properly starting today.</p><p>As for commodities this morning, the oil price has been up above $92 a barrel and is higher than that now as well. $1,423 or thereabouts for gold. Up $2 after being lower earlier.</p><p>Mary Matalin coming up a little bit later this hour with the I-man as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now here at Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: I can't hear you. (INAUDIBLE) here. What's the matter with you?</p><p>It is five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Mary Matalin is coming up.</p><p>Well, I can't hear you. We're trying to -- we're sitting here talking about the guy who does the \"Red Eye\" show on the Fox News Channel. It's on at 3:00 a.m. Gary --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Greg.</p><p>IMUS: Gray --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Gutfield.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfield.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Or Feld. Feld, actually.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfeld.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I said, I had a suspicion that he might be pretty good. My wife says he is. And now here's how he came to my attention, because I was watching the Fox New Year's Eve thing. I was out at the ranch.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I was watching <person><nameText>Megyn Kelly, </nameText></person>who I like, and Bill Hemmer, who I like him, too. And they were just way too happy. I mean that girl was so happy, she was beside herself. And she's about 29 months pregnant. So she's got the baby coming up here.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: And they were just hysterical. Now, I didn't stay with them to see the ball come down, because I don't do that. If you -- if you watch the ball come down --</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: You can't be a bigger loser in life. You can't do it. And if you're there, most of the people in Times Square itself are from somewhere else. They're tourists. They're not -- there's no New Yorkers who I know, and I've been here for a long time, 30 years, who go there and stand there and, you know, let people pee on you while they -- while you're waiting for the ball to come down. I just don't think that happens, do you, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's not going to happen.</p><p>IMUS: All right. So, I was asking about -- so, anyway, he was on, the \"Red Eye\" guy, not the radio red eye guy, the other one, the TV \"Red Eye\" guy. And so we -- I thought, well, let's have him on. Let's have him as a guest. But first we have to find -- I mean I'm not interested in -- we didn't get to be a successful as we are by experimenting, although we did used to do that. But we don't do that anymore. We don't experiment with talent. So, I guess, what's the matter, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: There's something on your shoulder, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: There is?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, on your --</p><p>MCSHANE: Your coming apart.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you know, hey, Connell --</p><p>MCCORD: Uh-oh.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, Trevor. You know what happened?</p><p>MCGUIRK: (INAUDIBLE). Damn it, someone!</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Easy mistake.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Can you hear us now, chief? He can't hear us.</p><p>IMUS: No, I can't hear you, you little bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, thanks for telling us.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Connell, this thing -- I mean, Trevor, this thing came loose again.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'll fix it for you.</p><p>IMUS: Well, actually, he can fix it.</p><p>All right, time for a little news and here with that --</p><p>MCSHANE: Is Trevor.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter?</p><p>MCCORD: Just the ongoing saga of the ear monitors.</p><p>IMUS: These are my $1,500 ear monitors.</p><p>MCCORD: There's something every freakin' 15 minutes.</p><p>IMUS: That won't stay together.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But what about Greg Gutfeld?</p><p>IMUS: Well, we're going to watch him -- I'm going to watch his show tonight --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: And if he's any good, we'll have him on. I bet he must be, wouldn't you think? Have you ever seen it, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. I have not really seen the show. It's on, as you said, 3:00 in the morning, no.</p><p>IMUS: My wife says he's good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And Opie, Anthony -- Anthony's on a lot, right?</p><p>BARTLETT: Supposedly.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we know Anthony's funny. I'll listen (ph).</p><p>Here's Chuck with the news.</p><p>MCCORD: The president says he is honored to have signed the bill to provide the aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks and first responders who became ill working at Ground Zero. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, named after a police officer who died of a respiratory disease that he contracted during the 9/11 operations, his father now says he is happy others will finally be getting the help they need.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an important not only because my son was sick for four years, you know, and we watched him die and we couldn't get no help for him. Now -- there was -- no one would recognize that he was sick from the World Trade Center.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: The bill provides $4.2 billion in help to sick workers and several hundred people who live near the burning pile, the toxicity at the World Trade Center ruins. The president signing the measure in private as his Hawaiian vacation neared its end.</p><p>IMUS: Bill Carter, a journalist from \"The New York Times,\" who's a nice guy, by the way. Writes all these books about the late night talk show wars that nobody cares about and no one reads. And -- but they're good. I guess I read them. (INAUDIBLE). He and some other clown wrote an article over the past couple of weeks about Jon Stewart being perhaps the new Edward R. Murrow --</p><p>MCCORD: Crusader.</p><p>IMUS: Which I suspect even Mr. Stewart, who I am a fan of --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Found amusing. If not ironic, except every time I use the word ironic, with apologies to Nora Ephron, I always wonder if I'm using it correctly.</p><p>MCCORD: Correct.</p><p>IMUS: And I suspect I'm not. But at any rate, because Stewart was railing about the Republicans who had embraced tragedy of 9/11 as almost their campaign mantra slogan deal, and that they were not entitled to do that anymore because essentially they had refused, which I thought was a disgrace and so did Mr. Stewart. So he talked about it. Then he had some of the responders on. So they were, Mr. Carter and some other dope from \"The Times,\" were crediting Mr. Stewart with providing the impetus for this to be passed, which I thought, well, it might have brought some attention to it, but it certainly didn't spur any Republicans to change their minds about it or to feel some sort of necessity to take action on this and to realize how absolutely disgraceful they were behaving.</p><p>But I saw Shep Smith -- I played this last hour and it's worth playing again. I'll tell you why. Because he does the news on -- he does the news two hours on it on the Fox News Channel. And some of my friends, like Esther Newberg, I love her to death, but is one of these elitist, liberal snobs who, you know, they all think they have all the answers and she's one of these people who refuses to watch Fox News because she thinks they have some sort of agenda and yet, like a moron, she'll watch MSNBC or CNN, who are both dreadful and disgraceful and clearly do have an agenda or, say, CBS or ABC or, for God's sake, NBC.</p><p>So I would call her attention, and I would call to Mr. Carter's attention as well, what Shep Smith had to say about it. And Shep Smith -- I'm going to play it in a second -- referenced Jon Stewart. What I think is significant about it is, is that if you're a Republican like John Thune, I had that dope on, and some of these other people who were dragging their feet and just refusing to vote on this, and Senator Thune had these lame excuses that he gave me. And much to my discredit, I didn't press him on it and should have, but I thought, well, he didn't want to rush into anything and it was too much other money was -- it was a bunch of pork and stuff in it and even that was kind of Bernie's rap on this. And people like Hannity and some of these other dopes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Those are the facts.</p><p>IMUS: The facts are nothing. The point is -- the facts are stupid. The point is, it should have been passed and, of course, now it was passed and they did take out about $3 billion of pork.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: My point, God, if I could make the point, is that when Shep Smith talked about it, that got the attention of all of the Republicans and everyone else, because they're thinking, if Shep Smith, with that enormous audience that he has and that Fox News has, if he's against this, then as Walter Cronkite famously said or Lyndon Johnson said about Walter Cronkite during the Vietnam War, if we've lost him, we've lost the country. Here's Shep Smith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS: Last night on Jon Stewart, it was Jon Stewart's last (INAUDIBLE) of the week and, OK, we watch it. Whatever. And he's just flat on, absolutely right. And it's worth saying, who's going to hold these people's feet to the fire when we -- you know, we're able to put a 52 story building down there so far at Ground Zero. We're able to pay for tax cuts for billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the economy, but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire, went down there to save people. The people knew what this city was like that day. People were walking over bridges. They were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying. Their family members were dead. And these people ran to Ground Zero to stave people's lives. And we're not going to even give them medicine for the illnesses that they got down there. It's disgusting. It's a national disgrace. It's a shame. And everybody who voted against it should have to stand up and account for himself or herself. Is anybody going to hold them accountable?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you just did.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I'm not really in a position to do that. I mean I think I just kind of went out there and said what the truth is and I feel like -- I feel like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people. There was no warning label on Ground Zero on 9/11 \"these substances will kill you.\" And even if there had been, they'd have gone anyway. They just need a little bit of help. It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do doing anything for those people, don't we?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: So that's Shep Smith, Fox News. So the next time one of you want to tell me about Fox News, I'm going to tell you about Shep Smith. That's what I'm talking about.</p><p>Now, I didn't see Diane Sawyer and I didn't see that coward Brian Williams or that little rodent over there. Well, we don't need to get into name calling, Don.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, why are we?</p><p>IMUS: Or the very lovely Katie Couric --</p><p>MCCORD: Better.</p><p>IMUS: Or the -- well, not so courageous, that's a better way to put it, Brian Williams. Did you ever -- did -- what -- did they say anything about it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, of course not. Were they railing about it at MSNBC? Well, of course not. So that's what I'm talking about. So if you're the John Thunes of the world and you turn that on -- it's on all the time here -- if you see Shep Smith calling you out --</p><p>MCCORD: Then, wait a minute.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, Chris Wallace in there sucking his thumb, thinking, oh, I hope I don't get in trouble.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, he brought it up on the Sunday show.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, quarter after the hour. Time for a little sports now.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And the (INAUDIBLE) Democrats controlled Congress for two years, with the Democratic president, and they waited till the lame duck session to try to pass this (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>IMUS: Save all that for next time you're on Hannity.</p><p>It's 16 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I'll get an e-mail from Hannity.</p><p>Did we do your business report yet, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: Not yet, I don't think.</p><p>IMUS: No, OK, we can do it in a minute. Don't worry about it.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK, I'm not.</p><p>IMUS: Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf.</p><p>Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Well, they completed the playoff picture last night. The lonely Seattle Seahawks finishing 7-9, beat the Rams 16-6. They win the NFC West. Change the rule, man. Forget winning the division, you can't have a losing record. You're out. Replaced by the non-playoff team with the best record. The Giants, by the way, will bring back Tom Coughlin.</p><p>Packers win their final wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3.. That eliminated the Giants. The Colts win the AFC South, beat the Titans 23-20. Adam Vinatieri's 43 yard field goal, last play of the game. Although the Colts didn't know it, because they didn't show the score on the scoreboard. They had actually won it minutes earlier when the Jags lost. The Steelers win the AFC North. The Falcons win the NFC South.</p><p>And the NBA last night, in Los Angeles, before a rare booing crowd, they booed the Lakers at the Staples Center. The Lakers lost to the Grizzlies by 19 points, 104-85. And after the game, Phil Jackson blamed it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, early in the third quarter on some stupid plays, and, you know, Kobe has to screw up the, you know, game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one. That takes the rest of the guys out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Wow, Kobe screwing up the game.</p><p>IMUS: So Kobe was going one-on-one with some other member of the other team, obviously, duh, right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, one of the members of -- one of the audience members.</p><p>IMUS: Well, speaking of the audience, here's what's wrong with the Lakers.</p><p>WOLF: What is it?</p><p>IMUS: It's one thing if Jack Nicholson wants to have floor seats -- I mean, I think he deserves those. He's earned them, don't you think?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But not Larry David. Not some sit -- not some sitcom dope.</p><p>MCCORD: What's he done?</p><p>IMUS: Well, should be sitting there -- I mean you just can't.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, work it --</p><p>IMUS: And yet I watched the game on Christmas Day, the brain did -- of course I'm furiously e-mailing Breen my comments as he's trying to do the game, which I'm sure -- and he sometimes answers them, by the way.</p><p>WOLF: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: But Larry David? How possibly could Larry David -- who gave Larry David a floor seat? That's a disgrace.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He only created \"Seinfeld.\" Come on.</p><p>IMUS: What does \"Seinfeld\" have do with it. Seinfeld must have something to do with it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, a little bit. Larry David's a genius?</p><p>IMUS: Still shouldn't be sitting on -- he's a sitcom dope. He shouldn't be sitting on the floor.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get him out.</p><p>IMUS: He just don't. He may be a genius, but he shouldn't be sitting on the floor. This is the guy you were screaming about he peed on Jesus.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we all stray.</p><p>IMUS: He's -- he is a genius or you -- or he peed on Jesus. You can't pee on Jesus, can you?</p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: And be a genius.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The two are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>IMUS: It doesn't take a genius to pee on Jesus. It takes 12 -- well, it takes probably a drunk or, you know --</p><p>MCGUIRK: The fact that he got away with it, that was so offensive.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Anyway, 19 after the hour.</p><p>So, were you finished with sports, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: His third sack of the game.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Time for a little business news and here with that is Connell McShane.</p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Just a few quick headlines for you this morning. The market is up again after an 11 percent gain for the Dow in 2010. And the 17 percent rise for the Nasdaq in 2010. The futures are way up this morning. Maybe some optimism about economic data. We had plenty of it this week. Construction spending and manufacturing today. The big retail reports out for the month of December on Thursday and the jobs report for the month of December on Friday.</p><p>So that is there, plus the report, I-man, in \"The New York Times\" that we talked about earlier that Facebook has received an investment of $500 million from Goldman Sachs, according to \"The Times,\" which values Facebook at $50 billion.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. And then Dagen McDowell, who will be coming up in a few minutes. She and Connell do their very own show at 11:00 a.m. on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour. Here's one of Mary Matalin's five favorite songs.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let me tell you about Lindamood-Bell. You know what, the lady who runs Lindamood-Bell grew up on a cattle ranch. Old Nancy. Did you know that? I want to share with you the success story from the Lindamood-Bell learning processes. This is from a parent with an eight-year-old son diagnosed with autism. Here's the letter.</p><p>\"David was diagnosed with autism and struggled with socializing, expressive language, critical thinking, comprehension. David started with an assessment at Lindamood-Bell and did an eight week intensive program. The staff at Lindamood-Bell was sensitive to our concerns and needs and gave us constant feedback. David has improved tremendously. Before Lindamood-Bell, his overall comprehension was at the ninth percentile. After his retest at Lindamood-Bell, he was at the 70 percentile.\" That's unbelievable, isn't it? Call them at 800-300-1818 or go online at lindamoodbell.com.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Johnson &amp; Johnson, today, is going to announce a powerful new cancer test that it wants to put on the market.

And their hope is that the blood test can take the place of more invasive cancer tests.</p><p>Stocks starting off the new year with gains. The data out of China is being seen as a positive for the market. It showed manufacturing slip for the first time in five months, but what's that doing is it's easing some inflation concerns. And Europe has been up all morning long. London closed today because of the New Year's holiday. But Paris up 2 percent. Germany up 1.25 percent.</p><p>Here in the U.S., stock index futures indicating a higher open a little over an hour from now on Wall Street with the Dow futures up by 90 points. And a quick look at commodities as well. The oil price is around $92 a barrel all morning. And gold, after being lower, is now up over $1 at $1,422 per ounce.</p><p>All right. The IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right now here at the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Twenty-six after the hour as we continue to get behind here. But it's -- we're getting everything in, so that's more important than anything else, I guess. So, it's time for a little business news again. Here with that, Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>From getting behind to going up, gas prices. The national average for regular unleaded is already $3.07 a gallon. It's going to head back to near $4 a gallon by the spring according to many experts. It should be the second highest year on record in terms of prices. Let's hope it doesn't get back to $4.11 a gallon. That was a record hit in the summer of '08.</p><p>And, by the way, if you're interested in how Shania Twain's life develops with this new husband, who's the ex-husband of the woman who broke up Shania's marriage, she's going to have her own show on the new Oprah Winfrey Network later this year, I believe, called \"Why Not?\" with Shania Twain.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. So you can keep --</p><p>IMUS: Do you have a picture of the husband? Because she's cute.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's cute. Do we have a picture of their wedding?</p><p>IMUS: No, of him?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, well, of him.</p><p>IMUS: You were telling me how hot he was.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's got -- well, he's got curly -- he's got curly hair and it kind of has a little bit of a mullet if memory serves. He's pretty cute. He's better looking than Mutt Lange, I'll put it that way.</p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash deal on that, isn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, brother.</p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash trailer park situation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but you get to watch it for free, though, when you watch it on the TV. That's -- or you can come over to my house, which I don't think you want to do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. How did that go, by the way, over the holidays at your house?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was all right. I got trapped in the house with six adults, three kids and three dogs. And one of the dogs, being a four month old border collie puppy. So that was a good time.</p><p>IMUS: Who were the adults?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mama, daddy, brother, his wife, Jonas and me. If you could call us all adults.</p><p>IMUS: How is your brother's wife? How do you get along with her?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I adore her.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you do?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. We get along good.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, that's too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Well, we'd just like a little friction and stuff going on. So there wasn't any animosity that bubbled to the surface there or any long held resentments or anything?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I wasn't happy with -- no, I wasn't happy with my Christmas gifts from Jonas. But other than that.</p><p>IMUS: What did he get you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Underwear that he bought -- I know he bought on sale because I saw it on sale on the Internet. And a computer, a laptop, which is just business. I didn't want something business related. And I wanted underwear that fit that was nicer than what he gave me. So, I was mad. At least I didn't get those pajama jeans. I mean I can look on the bright side.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he didn't get you like them big ole granny drawers, did he?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some were, yes, large in size. Some, too small. There was no happy medium.</p><p>IMUS: He didn't' get --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was no happy medium. They were either to small and uncomfortable or they were too big and loose.</p><p>IMUS: So he didn't go the Victoria's Secret thong deal?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, he went on the Internet to one of these private sales sites and bought drawers on sale.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he got you some -- he got you some of those Hanes -- big old -- them Hanes big beefy drawers.</p><p>MCCORD: Off of eBay.</p><p>IMUS: All right, time for a Bernard McGuirk briefing, a \"Bernie Briefing,\" sponsored by -- these big old beefy drawers.</p><p>MCCORD: That ain't right.</p><p>IMUS: Sponsored by P.C. Richard &amp; Son. A hundred and one years they've got it going on. Still going on.</p><p>What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, chief, on the \"New Year's Rocking Eve\" fright night, the TV shows, I confess I was one of the losers who was up at midnight watching. And I was watching Dick Clark --</p><p>IMUS: No, don't do this.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And -- well, no, no, this is -- this is a big story. There are competing, differing opinions as to whether or not Dick Clark should still be out there. Some people say it's an inspiration, but --</p><p>IMUS: No, no. It's too humiliating for him. Whoever is around him shouldn't let him do this. It's terrible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DICK CLARK, BROADCASTER: But don't you go anywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Where did that come from?</p><p>IMUS: I didn't hear the sound. There's no point in playing it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We have audio here. Lou will play it.</p><p>Here, Lou. Go ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARK: Thank you, Ryan, very much. Now, take a look at all the people up on Broadway. I don't know how people pull off this party year after year, but they do a whale of a job. And tonight it will be bigger and better than ever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Again, some people say that's inspiring, and some people say it's out of place. But in any case, he won the night far and away. He was the most watched show that night of all the broadcast and cable New Year's Eve shows. And God bless poor old Dick Clark.</p><p>IMUS: You bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: What?</p><p>IMUS: You evil bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why?</p><p>IMUS: You just can't --</p><p>MCCORD: Well, he shouldn't be going on.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I didn't put him on ABC.</p><p>IMUS: No, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I think he should be on. I think he is an inspiration.</p><p>IMUS: Put him on Fox. No. No.</p><p>MCCORD: He was just presenting the controversy.</p><p>IMUS: You put him on ABC. You can't be. You can't do that. It's horrible.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I happen to disagree. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a nice thing. And again, it inspires people who have been ill.</p><p>My dad had a stroke, he came back from it. It makes people say, yes, I can do it.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. Here he is on -- who is that Ryan Seacrest? Do you have any sound on that, Big Foot.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We have a little -- we have sound. Lou and I have some sound from Ryan Seacrest just before --</p><p>IMUS: Well, there's Dick and -- Big Foot, we can't hear any sound on this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe he doesn't want to.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN SEACREST: Sorry. Sorry, not my fault.</p><p>CLARK: Happy New Year.</p><p>SEACREST: Happy New Year. Great job.</p><p>CLARK: Thank you, Ryan. Thank you.</p><p>SEACREST: Thank you so much.</p><p>Dick Clark, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>Well, we are inside, and it's even warmer in here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a nice thing. The man's been through hell and back. Way to kick off the new year.</p><p>Charles, push him. Is he all right?</p><p>MCCORD: He's all right, but he's --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Looking to the future.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: You son of a bitch!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Tom goes for the easy joke.</p><p>IMUS: Call that funny, Charles?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good. Now everybody is --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Everybody is waiting to see who is going to say it.</p><p>IMUS: Tom.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, Tom, have you got that clip? Lou?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll he come up here and I'll find you. Are you coming down here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just got to e-mail from Neil Cavuto.</p><p>IMUS: That's not funny.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was down at the ranch last we week.</p><p>MCCORD: This is not -- stop.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not funny. It's not funny, no.</p><p>MCCORD: This is not good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not funny, Bernard. It's not.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Look, God bless Dick Clark, is all I'm saying.</p><p>MCCORD: There is an is inspirational story.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. That Ryan Seacrest, too.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCCORD: You've got to stop.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God.</p><p>MCGUIRK: \"Blonde on Blonde\" is coming up tomorrow.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: That's just horrible. God.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Imus at night -- be there.</p><p>IMUS: Why do they do that? That's horrible.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are they wheeling him out there?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, it's his show. He's as lucid as they come. He just can't speak properly. So why not?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the way he's going to go out though.</p><p>MCGUIRK: So what? That's his choice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it's not.</p><p>IMUS: That's not right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It was a ratings winner for the night.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't think it had much to do --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go see how he is?</p><p>IMUS: Do you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Ryan Seacrest. You had a bunch of great performers. Kesha was there.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Ryan Seacrest, if you get down and you -- I mean, I like him, but if you get down and you scrape the bottom of the show biz barrel, that's where you find Ryan Seacrest. I mean, he's on the E! Channel, for God's sake.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's \"American Idol.\" He's at the top of his game, that guys.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, whatever. He's at the bottom of the barrel. He may be at the top of the game, but --</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: And when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California Congressman Darrell Issa getting a big promotion. He'll become the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which basically means he'll be the one or heading up the committee that oversees the government.</p><p>And appearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Issa telling Chris Wallace he's going to target government spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: We have about $1.7 trillion worth of regulatory costs already in the government. If the president wants to throw another $300 or $400 billion, what he's doing is taking it right out of businesses, right out of employment, right out of competitiveness. We need to make sure we can compete.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings as committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also Medicare.</p><p>Checking in on the markets here this morning for you, up all morning long. And we are indicated higher on the futures by 85 points now on Dow futures. It looks like a strong start to the new year coming on Wall Street in just a little while.</p><p>It's the IMUS IN THE MORNING program that continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>IMUS: Twenty minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country, and on the Fox Business Network all over the world. Three new radio affiliates today -- WAUB, 1590, way up there on the right-hand side of the dial where the dogs can listen, and at 94.1 FM here in Auburn, New York.</p><p>MCCORD: But you can't.</p><p>IMUS: On WGBA, 1240 on the dial there in Geneva, New York, Finger Lakes News Radio. And KWKC, 1340 AM, in Abilene, Texas, Talk Radio 1340.</p><p>Tomorrow, on this program, Tom Friedman. Wednesday, \"Blonde on Blonde.\"</p><p>Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, our old friend, former assistant to the president, vice president, a bunch of other stuff, Mary Matlin.</p><p>Good morning, Ms. Matalin.</p><p>MARY MATALIN, FMR. ASSISTANT TO VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY: Here, kitty kitty. Hey. Good morning. Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Are you calling the cat?</p><p>MATALIN: Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty kitty. She was trapped outside and was about to unleash the dogs of my hell, my mini dachshund. I said, \"Kitty.\"</p><p>It irritates I-Man. He doesn't want to hear you.</p><p>IMUS: I like cats and dogs. What's your cat's name?</p><p>MATALIN: Witchy. She has one green eye and one blue eye.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you out of breath?</p><p>MATALIN: Because I had to move the chair, open the shades, and open the window from the bottom up, while I was holding the phone in my ear. And I'm old now.</p><p>IMUS: Did you -- what did you do New Year's Eve?</p><p>MATALIN: Made black eyed peas and cabbage and listened to WWOZ and had a glass of wine by myself.</p><p>IMUS: Where was James?</p><p>MATALIN: Was it after 9:00? If it's after 9:00, he's in bed.</p><p>IMUS: So did you stay up and watch the ball come down?</p><p>MATALIN: I listened to WWOZ, which is the best jazz in the world -- Irvin Mayfield, jazz play club on Bourbon Street live.</p><p>IMUS: Radio?</p><p>MATALIN: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you didn't make that clear.</p><p>MATALIN: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I should know everybody doesn't know WWOZ. But if you don't, you can get it live streaming. It's the best jazz.</p><p>IMUS: Because Bernie just played a cut of Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve in which Mr. Clark was on. And, of course, he's had a stroke some years ago.</p><p>MATALIN: Yes, I saw it on, and I have to take Bernie's side as I do on most things on this. I thought it was an inspiration.</p><p>IMUS: You thought it was an inspiration?</p><p>MATALIN: I guess you don't.</p><p>IMUS: Well, an inspiration to who?</p><p>MATALIN: Just what Bernie said. If you've been -- if you've come back from something that -- a disease that people -- or suffered from something that would normally render you hidden away for whatever reason, and you can come back, that's an inspiration to others who are similarly afflicted. Heart disease or cancer or anything, you can talk about it and show people that everything is workable, and life is worth living.</p><p>IMUS: Does she have a point, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, and a point that it need not be in all cases the end and --</p><p>MATALIN: Or it can be a different reality.</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly. And Mr. Clark is a textbook example of that.</p><p>IMUS: Well, but my problem with it is --</p><p>MCCORD: What?</p><p>IMUS: -- is that whenever it gets played on this program, and the reason that it's intended to be a source of amusement, that's the problem.</p><p>MATALIN: So it's not -- so, as always, it's always about you. This is about what, is that you're saying? You didn't like it?</p><p>IMUS: Well, guess what? It's 2011. Suddenly, it's not going to be about me this year. Well, of course.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATALIN: This is your new New Year's resolution?</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but I don't know --</p><p>MCCORD: It could be about him a few years down the road.</p><p>IMUS: I just don't -- I don't know. I feel bad for the guy and I don't think it's funny. I mean, you can make it funny. They did make it funny, Bernie and Lou, of course, and Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: You made it funny.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MATALIN: You made it funny. Bernie made it about --</p><p>IMUS: Then they made it about me, a window to the future.</p><p>MATALIN: You invited it. You invited it by being so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I don't invite the ridicule that I constantly get on this program.</p><p>MATALIN: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p>MATALIN: OK.</p><p>IMUS: So the Bush tax cuts, I guess, have been extended. What does that mean?</p><p>MATALIN: That means these rich bastards who don't need them, you know, are now going to get them.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why do you think the president did it?</p><p>MATALIN: Because he's -- he just wanted to screw his own guys.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MATALIN: No. None of the above.</p><p>IMUS: Well what then?</p><p>MATALIN: It's -- I think we -- he did it because he didn't want to be blamed for not doing it. And Larry Summers and everybody else came out and said that reality, which will give us a double-dip recession if taxes are affected in a recession.</p><p>IMUS: So you think it's going to have an impact on the economy?</p><p>MATALIN: I think the opposite would have had a severe impact, a better impact --</p><p>IMUS: That's not what I asked you.</p><p>MATALIN: Well, these aren't yes or no questions.</p><p>IMUS: Well, answer it as best as you can, as you're capable of.</p><p>MATALIN: I'm answering it.</p><p>IMUS: By opening the window and choking your cat.</p><p>MATALIN: One of the cats, the one that still has a tail.</p><p>A better package would have been to have no spending increases and leave the tax structure as it was, and leave the estate tax where it was so people don't make decisions upon -- about their final days based on their tax situation, which I think is immoral. That would have been the better package, but that's not what happened because politics --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Well, the rap we were hearing, Mary Matalin, is that if we gave the tax cuts to all these rich bastards and these other folks, that that would all -- that they would then invest in the economy and hire more people and all that sort of thing.</p><p>So, my question is, do you think that's going to happen?</p><p>MATALIN: No, that's the rap that -- that's -- the case for tax cuts as a stimulative economic policy do not --</p><p>IMUS: I like that phrase.</p><p>MATALIN: -- go to those tax cuts. That was maintaining a tax rate, the changing of which would have exacerbated recessionary problems.</p><p>Stimulative taxes -- not all tax cuts are created equal -- would have been further reductions of the top rates, a reduction in the corporate tax rate, eradication of corporate taxes loopholes and such, and tax reform, which the president's talking about. That's stimulative tax policy, not just keeping the same rates. So that's one of their canards.</p><p>And what would be most stimulative now is to continue to reduce or make some effort to stop spending and roll back the debt, starting with health care. So that will be the plan, and I hope they get some of it done.</p><p>IMUS: And your scummy Republican friends were shamed into caving in on the 9/11 Responders Bill.</p><p>MATALIN: In response to scummy liberals, who --</p><p>IMUS: And inspired quite a bit by Shep Smith (ph).</p><p>MATALIN: -- let it sit there for years and did nothing about it, and wait until it's Christmas Eve and lard it up. Yes, it should have been passed. It should have been passed two years earlier. There shouldn't have been anybody who had any problem getting any health care at any time from 9/11 on.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, that's a very good point.</p><p>Hey, how are things in New Orleans? You live there now, right?</p><p>MATALIN: We're going on year three.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MATALIN: This is our third year here. It's wonderful.</p><p>IMUS: Who is the new mayor there?</p><p>MATALIN: He's spectacular.</p><p>IMUS: Who is it -- huh?</p><p>MATALIN: He's going to be up in New York. He comes a lot. He's got a new police chief.</p><p>IMUS: What is his name?</p><p>Oh, I'm sorry. Mitch Landrieu, Mayor Mitch.</p><p>IMUS: Has he been indicted yet?</p><p>MATALIN: We used to -- half the state was under water and other half was under indictment. But we're not like that now. We're all cleaned up now.</p><p>IMUS: Happy New Year to you, the kids, him.</p><p>MATALIN: And Happy New Year. You'll never be -- you'll always be you, Imus. You'll just always be you.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let's hope so. Thank you.</p><p>MATALIN: Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Mary Matalin.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Here is the \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day. There was a glitch in the phone's alarm clock feature. Users who set their alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't go off when 2011 arrived.</p><p>An Apple spokesperson says the fix is in the works and all alarms will work properly starting today. But users in Europe and Asia saying the problem has not yet been fixed.</p><p>Vizio, maker of inexpensive flat-TV screens, is looking to expand. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell phones and tablet computers, and those two products, the Via Phone and the Via Tablet, will be introduced this summer.

That movie bringing in just over $26 million this past weekend, so it's total now $103 million.</p><p>With no other movies -- no new movies being released over the New Year's weekend, the rest of the lineup looks similar to last week.

He's here.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he is?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's unusual, because ordinarily he would stretch one of these New Year's deals into an extra week's vacation, but apparently he's not done that.</p><p>Gangsta Mickey is here, and so is Charles Rangel, neither of whom have been on this morning, but they will get on coming up.</p><p>It's five minutes now until the hour.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you looking at me -- with your mouth hanging open like a $2 suitcase?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Huh?</p><p>IMUS: Made you look -- huh? What's the matter?</p><p>POWELL: No, it's just another day at the home. That's what it is.

I wasn't eating, you idiot.</p><p>POWELL: Well, you freaked out about it though. It's like, \"Oh, my fork.\"</p><p>IMUS: I dropped it because I have this tea, and they have hunks of lemon in it.

I went to the Jets game yesterday, they won, 38-7. But you know that already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS: Yes, I don't care about the Jets game because they were already in the playoffs. So I don't care about the Seattle Seahawks and the Rams people, but I'll find out apparently from Warner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCSHANE: So one of them with - record made the playoffs. I'm being told in my ear, you want to know who won now or no?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IMUS: No, let me find out from Warner, because, Warner likes to tell me stuff like that.</p><p>MCSHANE: It is Warner's job.</p><p>IMUS: Santa brought us a goofy tie? Is that what happened?</p><p>MCSHANE: No, I had that one already, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: The funny tie, under the tree.</p><p>MCSHANE: So you got two weeks off and that is the best you could come up with.</p><p>IMUS: That's all I could come up with.</p><p>MCSHANE: You sound great, by the way. How this is voice, good?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't have throat cancer, they tell me, but I do have -- pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCSHANE: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Yes --and, like if you had a colonoscopy and they find this -- remove them, so, these are -- they have to take them off with a laser here in a couple of weeks, and this is way too much information.</p><p>MCSHANE: I actually care. I told you, I care.</p><p>IMUS: I'll be fine.</p><p>MCSHANE: You will be OK, that is the main point.</p><p>IMUS: Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, and Mary Matalin coming up this morning. Three new radio affiliates - have you even seen that guy who does the red eye thing here on Fox.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Is he any good.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, sure. It's fine. I don't watch it. It is on in the middle of the night, but a lot of people like it.</p><p>IMUS: I saw him on the news with <person><nameText>Megyn Kelly </nameText></person>and -- too happy to suit me, but he seemed funny.</p><p>MCSHANE: He is pretty funny.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder if we should have him on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Sure, why not. Give it a try.</p><p>IMUS: Is he any good? He is good. You are saying that because we're on - - on TV, here, aren't you.</p><p>MCSHANE: That is why, yes.</p><p>IMUS: What is going on with business -- how this is Facebook deal, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, $50 billion valuation on Facebook. It's no joke right there.</p><p>IMUS: Please.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's what Goldman thinks it's worth anyway. I will get to that in a second, but thank you, I-man and good morning. First, let's bring up the markets and look up some numbers here because stocks are starting off the new week and the New Year with some gains here globally.</p><p>China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and if anything that's actually easing concerns about inflation and the Chinese market at the bottom screen is up 1-3/4 percent overnight.</p><p>Markets in Hong Kong and South Korea are also up, and Japan has not resumed trading yet in the New Year. Over in Europe, London is closed today for the New Year's holiday, but Paris and Frankfurt are both up significantly, Paris by more than 2 percent and our futures indicating a higher open on Wall Street as well up by 76 points on Dow futures, pretty good numbers.</p><p>Now as for the major indexes and how they fared in 2010, the Dow gained 11 percent, S&amp;P 13 percent, the Nasdaq the best performer of the bunch, 17 percent gain.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on more debt national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion ceiling and the White House Council of Economic Advisors, Chairman Austin Goolsbee on ABC's \"This Week\" saying it's crucial the ceiling is raised.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUSTIN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: This is not a game, you know, the debt ceiling is not something to toy with. That is the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that is the -- essentially defaulting on our obligations, which is unprecedented in American history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree it does need to be raised but, many of them are also saying they will not go along with it unless they get promises to change Washington's spending habits and argue there is no point in having a debt ceiling if they raise it every time the national debt gets close. Now here's the story that the I-man was referring to a moment ago.</p><p>Goldman Sachsinvesting $450 million in Facebook, according to the \"New York Times.\" A Russian company also buying $50 million worth of Facebook's stock. \"The Times\" says these deals value Facebook at $50 billion. Now, as we have reported the FCC now looking into secondary market trading at Facebook's privately held shares.</p><p>Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its web site, the latest development in the conflict between airlines and online travel agencies, since American cut ties with Orbitz, the airline says Expedia intentionally listed its flights and schedules lower in search results. American is looking to push consumers to buy tickets on its own web site and every effort to save money. Expedia says the move will only cost them ticket sales and believes Americans' efforts are bad for travellers.</p><p>All right, let's take a live look now at commodities this morning. The oil price is above $92 per barrel and gold is down by a dollar per ounce.</p><p>Coming up, a little bit later on in the hour, Bo Dietl will be the I-man's guest as IMUS IN THE MORNING does get started, right now, Fox Business, power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: Warner, who won the football game last night?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Seahawks, man, they finished 7-9. Win the division and are in the playoffs.</p><p>IMUS: So the giants, who are 10-6, they are not in the playoffs.</p><p>WOLF: You got it. No, you have to change the rule.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN: That is crazy.</p><p>WOLF: Absurd, yes.</p><p>IMUS: I will whip somebody's butt over there -- Charles and I.</p><p>WOLF: Now you're talking.</p><p>IMUS: Charles and me, yes. And, I get my grammar screwed up. Happy New Year, everybody.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Shucks.</p><p>IMUS: Bring you up on my medical, last time --</p><p>MCCORD: Let's have the latest.</p><p>IMUS: I'm had a biopsy -- let me say this about Mt. Sinai. It is a great hospital. You know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and Cornell and Mt. Sinai is a great hospital. The nurses are unbelievable and Dr. Peekaboo Woo, and Dr. Allen Reid, the anesthesiologist, are fabulous.</p><p>MCCORD: Good.</p><p>IMUS: They all did a great job and I apparently do not have throat cancer. What I have are these pre-cancerous cells.</p><p>MCCORD: Dysplasia, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Charles knows more about what I have than I do.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, they have to remove them with a laser, and, at a high level, and they would develop into --</p><p>MCCORD: Get rid of them, that is why we get rid of them.</p><p>IMUS: And you know how I got them? Smoking.</p><p>MCCORD: Really? That is what they say? OK.</p><p>IMUS: I haven't smoked for 15 years, but -</p><p>MCCORD: Listen to that, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, so I'm fine, Bo Dietl, Jerry Greenfield.</p><p>MCCORD: That's great news to start the new year.</p><p>IMUS: Bo Dietl, still have prostate cancer but, I think I do. I'm not sure anymore whether I do or not.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, may have defeated that.</p><p>IMUS: And, I came back from the ranch on Saturday.</p><p>MCCORDs: That's 700 miles an hour with the freaking tail wind.</p><p>IMUS: What a great vacation. It's 10 degrees. We have to go out there, because we run the place. It's 10 degrees -- the wind - there's not a ski resort.</p><p>MCCORD: How about that wind?</p><p>IMUS: The wind blows and I'm not exaggerating, 60 miles an hour. Anyway, Bo Dietl, Jeff Greenfield, Mary Matalin, coming up and we have three new radio affiliates, and when I put my glasses on I'll tell you who they are.</p><p>I'm not going to do it now and, ratings came out in New York and for people -- the ratings are broken down, all kinds of demographics and I don't believe in them but I think they give you a rough idea, of you know - - I mean, you can -- like lit-fm or one of those -- hot 97 or one of these. Whoever these stations are, that do well.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And if it is consistent over a long period of time, like when stern was on terrestrial radio, you knew he was number one, and had been on a long time, a trend that remains supported, consistency.</p><p>IMUS: So, but on these 12-plus numbers they measure people by demographics like break it down to 12 to 18, 25-54, 18-34, it is ridiculous. Men, women, all of this and there's another one they do and it is just everybody who is 12 years of age or older. And, this program, the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, is the number 2 program in New York.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get out of town!</p><p>MCCORD: Shut the front door!</p><p>IMUS: Now, of course, I told Connell and Dagen that part of that, because, they are about the only new thing we have done here, other than I have a better attitude. They were partly responsible for that and then I got to thinking about it and if it weren't for them, we could have easily been number one.</p><p>MCCORD: Number one. Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'm sorry, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Which is the reason, when I got fired, and got the job at ABC I insisted on bringing Lou and Bernie, and Charles and everybody else, because, I knew without them, I would just be -- if it weren't for them, I would be on some station, in Jersey with Uncle Floyd.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Uncle Floyd!</p><p>IMUS: I'd be on Sirius satellite radio. Mel likes me, to give me a job for 50 grand a year. And sit there -</p><p>RUFINO: At UHF --</p><p>IMUS: The I-man's blues channel, Blues and alternate country on Sirius. But, as it is -- so the show -- I've never been number 2, ever. Not back when --</p><p>MCCORD: Your best ratings.</p><p>IMUS: Not back when I was. So I'm happy about that and it is a great program. It's a better program than it ever was. Having very little to do -- not being self-effacing, having we little to do with me, Bernie, Lou, they are all great. Time for a little news and here with that is Chuck McCord. Good morning, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Good morning, I-man. Speaking of the weather, the main highway between southern and central California, shut down, both directions, blowing snow and ice from another big storm. The grapevine area of I-5 closed indefinitely, winds gusting to -- reminded me, winds, gusting to 90 miles per hour in mountain areas, and still accumulating at elevations, as low as just 1,500 feet.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>says he is honored to sign the bill to provide aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks, and first responders, all of whom --</p><p>IMUS: You know --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: \"The New York Times\" did an article about the stuff that Jon Stewart, who as you know, I like, stuff Jon Stewart did about the 9/11 bill.</p><p>MCCORD: I saw it and all of that.</p><p>IMUS: And wondering if Jon Stewart was under Edward R. Murrow, which I would hope even Jon Stewart would be embarrassed about. But perhaps he's not or we don't know because I don't know him, but I would suggest -- and it has nothing do with anything, but until Shep Smith went on the rant that he went on, as a result of seeing Jon Stewart's show, which Shep said he did, and -- hey, big foot --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS: There's the famous rap that Shep Smith did, he was talking to somebody, and he referenced Jon Stewart, and he had seen the Jon Stewart show apparently the night before, there's got to be a way to find that, right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we'll find it.</p><p>IMUS: He was -- first of all, they are both terrific, both Stewart and Shep Smith is magnificent. Few better, in fact -- I don't know if there is anybody better, but it was a respond -- did you site, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. I did --</p><p>IMUS: Am I right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: On the money, a 100 percent.</p><p>IMUS: He was absolutely spectacular.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I happened to see that.</p><p>IMUS: And it seemed to me it was spontaneous.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Certainly seemed that way.</p><p>IMUS: And the boy seemed to be articulate to me and I have to play it for you. So I think that if you are a bunch of Republicans, I -- remember I had John Thune on and he was giving me some nonsense about -- didn't wanted to rush into it.</p><p>I didn't press him hard on that, not as much as I should have, and, you know, the -- I started to say to him, you know, don't want to rush into anything and, I hope we get it before all of these people die. So, people like Senator Thune, who I am no longer supporting for anything --</p><p>MCGUIRK: That may be premature. The Republicans -- they ended up saving $3 billion from that particular bill. That is what they were holding out for, eliminate --</p><p>IMUS: They weren't going to do it until they got shamed into it by Jon Stewart and by Shep Smith, I'm saying. And when Shep Smith attacked them, I'm sure they were thinking, that is our home boy there, at Fox.</p><p>I mean, I'm sure in their minds they are thinking if we lost Shep Smith we lost the country. You would expect Jon Stewart. I thought it was magnificent what he did, by the way, but you expect him to do what he did but you wouldn't expect Shep Smith to do what he did and if you lose him you lost everybody. I mean, I'm sure they are thinking that and go that the scared into passing it, didn't they, Bernie, talking about the money they saved, because you carry water for them.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's the fact. Chuck Schumer's bill was $7 billion and, the bill ended up being $4 billion and they saved --</p><p>IMUS: But they wouldn't have done anything, had there not been those two events, am I right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Perhaps, there's no way to conclusively prove that, but it sure seems that way.</p><p>IMUS: And let me ask you this, for everybody who thinks, Sarah Palin is a moron, and I would be one of them, would you would this country be any worse off today if she were president? Answer me that. Tell me. I'm waiting --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Checkmate for the I-man.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Because, at least -- think whatever you want to think about her, and think as I do, maybe, even. I don't know that I think she is a moron but she'd have sense enough to at least ask the people rather than get the same people bush had. But, this dope has been doing -- I mean, is he still on vacation in Hawaii, by the way?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. He comes back I think late today.</p><p>IMUS: And then, on I-25, out there in Santa Fe, when you go up to the ranch into Santa Fe, before you get into Santa Fe, there was a guy has a houses -- a lot of people have houses, a guy has a house, puts up these goofy billboards, a homemade billboard.</p><p>And, makes me laugh every time, they change and he's obviously a Hannity devotee or one of them and once he has had up there for a while. Where is the birth certificate? The hand lettered dopey sign, where is the birth certificate. Here's my question -- where is it? I mean, I'm not a -- obviously I'm not one of those --</p><p>MCGUIRK: A birther?</p><p>IMUS: Of course not. But, where is it?</p><p>MCCORD: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: Isn't the governor of ha walkers wasn't he screaming all about it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's claiming --</p><p>IMUS: Where is it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, let's see it. Clear this up.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, if the guy who is supporting the president -- which I would tend to support him, too, by the way. But I just say.</p><p>MCCORD: Let's resolve this.</p><p>IMUS: Why haven't we ever seen it or why don't they produce it, I can't answer that.</p><p>IMUS: It just adds fuel to these nuts.</p><p>MCCORD: Of course it does.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, 16 after the hour, taking way too much time with my nonsense, did you do any news at all? I interrupted you, 9/11 bill.</p><p>MCCORD: The James Zadroga bill has been signed by the president there in Hawaii, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Carly? Anymore coffee? She left --</p><p>MCCORD: I'll go get you some.</p><p>IMUS: She said what did Wyatt get for Christmas and I couldn't remember, horse stuff. She said, well does she still believe in Santa Claus?</p><p>MCCORD: And your reply.</p><p>IMUS: I said, well, I still believe in Santa Claus. Why wouldn't he? You know, 17 after the hour, Warner will do a little sports and before that, a quick business update, from Connell McShane here on the Fox Business Network and on the radio as well. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man. I'm talking about the markets here, as we start off the new trading year to the up side, after a pretty good year in 2010, stocks are up, globally, this morning.</p><p>News out of China that show the economy there slowing down a little bit, seen as a good sign because it eases concerns about inflation. Anyway, the futures are up. The European markets that are open are all up and the Asian markets were up, overnight as well.</p><p>Now, as for the year in 2010, the Dow ended the year, with a gain of 11 percent, the S&amp;P was up 13 percent, and the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, with a rise of nearly 17 percent, in 2010.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning and Dagen McDowell will be along -- you guys still have your show 11:00 a.m.</p><p>MCSHANE: So far, I believe, yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK, we'll start the year, brand new year with their show and they'll still do that and, that's good. Three new radio affiliates, WAUB at 1590 and 98.1 FM, out there in Auburn, New York and WGVA, at 1240, in Geneva, New York. Finger Lakes news radio, they call that.</p><p>And, KWKC, 1340, on the AM dial, down there in Abiline, Texas, talk radio 1340 and they joined the IMUS In The Morning line-up of stations around the country beginning this morning. Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man, well, completing the NFL picture, the playoffs last night, Seattle wins the NFC West with a record of 7-9. Come on!</p><p>IMUS: Who do they play, New Orleans?</p><p>WOLF: They'll play the Saints, yes, on Saturday. You have to change the rule here very quickly. You know, forget winning the division, if you have a losing record you are not in the playoffs. You take the team with the next best record, which would have been the Giants or the Bucks at 10-6.</p><p>Earlier, the Packers beat the Bears, 10-3. The Packers, 10-6, win the final wildcard. AFC, the Colts win the AFC South, on the 43 yard field goal, last play of the game, although the Colts had won it minutes earlier when the Jags were eliminated. Steelers, win the AFC. North Falcons win the NFC South so the playoffs are all set.</p><p>Packers, Eagles, in Philadelphia and Saints and Seahawks in Seattle, Jets and Colts in Indianapolis and the Ravens and Chiefs in Kansas City, yes, did you watch any of the bowl games?</p><p>WOLF: None.</p><p>IMUS: You know, I've watched them all, except I didn't pay any attention to them because they don't mean anything.</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: Including the one -- a week from tonight, Auburn and Oregon, you make me watch that.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I'll watch that.</p><p>IMUS: I won't be watching it. So, you'll watch that?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I will.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you be at Imus on Broadway, wouldn't you want to see that?</p><p>WOLF: A conflicting time.</p><p>IMUS: It is that night. It's already sold out, so, I mean -- I could try to get you in, but -- you don't express any interest, and every day you can go to some stupid movie and routinely get a half a chicken sandwich or tuna, whatever the hell you eat, a bottle of wine and go to the gym and, see a stupid movie, park in the handicapped zone and then, go to some idiot's Broadway musical or play of some sort and yet you won't come see Imus on Broadway. That is Monday night. You will watch the stupid game between Auburn and Oregon?</p><p>WOLF: No, forget that bowl game!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Too late.</p><p>IMUS: They got to get a playoff. They have playoffs, I mean, just stupid they don't have that. Don't you agree, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Absolutely, every baseball, basketball, college, hockey and -- everything, all have playoffs, except football.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking of Imus on Broadway, Colin Quinn, who stars in long story short, which I saw which is genius stuff, directed by Jerry Seinfeld, Colin now joined the line-up of Broadway musical shows that will perform Monday night at the Hard Rock.</p><p>MCCORD: Great.</p><p>IMUS: For the Imus cattle ranch for kids with cancer. And, the legendary emcee, which I exchanged e-mails throughout the past two weeks with, Dick Cavett is our emcee and that is worth going to see, to see him.</p><p>And I'll be there, just to introduce him. I wanted to thank our title sponsor, GMC and, one place you can go to look great, feel good and feel great and a GMC sales associate will show you the latest and greatest health and fitness products. Imus on Broadway, brought do you by GMC, which we're going to tape that -- probably -- are we going to tape it, big foot, or not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We'll tape it if you want.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know, I don't know, if you can or not. Anyway, Warner Wolf sports, sponsored by American-made Peerless Boilers and the new 96 percent efficient purifier series. You have any more sports, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: There's one more thing, listen to this, I-man the Grizzlies beat the slumping Lakers last night, in L.A., by 19 points. And after the game, Phil Jackson really took it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, behind early in the third quarter, on -- stupid plays, and, Kobe has to screw up, you know, the game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one, and takes the rest of the guys out --</p><p>WOLF: Wow. Kobe's screwing up the game. Phil Jackson. That is pretty harsh.</p><p>IMUS: You know who I have become a fan of now?</p><p>WOLF: Kevin Durant?</p><p>IMUS: No. The Miami Heat. I'll tell you why --</p><p>WOLF: Why, I-man?</p><p>RUFINO: Can't wait for this.</p><p>IMUS: Shut up, Lou! I'll tell you why.</p><p>WOLF: I wonder why.</p><p>RUFINO: Miami heat, good God!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Courageous.</p><p>WOLF: It has nothing to do with the fact they've won 17 out of the last 18 and 11 in a row.</p><p>IMUS: No. No. Because, something Magic Johnson said. He said, LeBron James is playing out of his mind, and he said it is time to stop booing him. He may -- you may be unhappy that he left Cleveland and the way he went about it but, you have to get over that. The guy is a great basketball player. So, they have got that together.</p><p>MCCORD: This is why?</p><p>IMUS: What's wrong?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why didn't he go to a team that didn't have a bunch of star players and elevate them as most great players do?</p><p>IMUS: Because that wasn't our plan. It's 24 after the hour. All right, Steven Stills is 66 years old today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Looking for an investment opportunity but not sure where to start?

Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm good, welcome back, good to see you, sound great, look even better.</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All righty. So, iPhone, the Apple in its iPhone seemed to fall down on the job during the first two days of 2011 when the alarms that some iPhone owners set failed to go off, leaving folks to oversleep, apparently, it was one time alarm settings, not the recurrent ones saying, Apple will not say what went wrong with it but, apparently it will be fixed from here on out. I gave my mama an iPad for Christmas.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you did?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and, she opened it up and it was sealed, bought it at the Apples store at Danbury Mall, it was sealed she opened it and it said Happy Holidays, Dennis Piper and Alan Rosenthal (ph). It was engraved by two Endodontists that worked in Norwalk, that was my mama's Christmas gift from us. She kept it though.</p><p>IMUS: I don't quite understand you. Did you Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The iPad was engraved by these two Endodontists who apparently given them to their staff or costumers and somebody returned it to the Apple store and exchange it. But Apple.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, they sold to you for.</p><p>MCDOWELL: .and they sold it to me at no discounted, I might add.</p><p>IMUS: What was the story then, the Apple store?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, Apple store, so, mama got a kick out of it. I thought it was appropriate, you know, Christmas gift, root canals, you know, spending time with your family, all kinds of seems, dove tell together.</p><p>IMUS: I thought she would have been offended that it didn't say Merry Christmas.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, no. She was probably offended by the fact we got her the cheaper one, see the Wi-Fi, we got her the one with where you can -- the AT&amp;T.</p><p>IMUS: That's the one you got to have, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Well, we chintz out on that, Merry Christmas, mama, that's it.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you take it back?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Too lazy, too much trouble.</p><p>IMUS: For your mama?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. She seems happy with it. She's fine. And, I only have to see her like twice a year, what she'll going to do about it?</p><p>IMUS: She's crying inside.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: She has to seem happy, so, she's happy that this marriage of yours is working out apparently, so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She's not happy I'm not living at home with three kids, single.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, and surprised. Thirty three minutes after the hour, time for a Bernie briefing sponsored by PC Richard and Son. And here with all of that is Bernard McGuirk. Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, chief. Well, like most of us during the break, we were either skiing in Switzerland or down in St. Barts, you know, lounging off of P. Diddy's yacht or something. So, we weren't paying attention to a lot of things. But over the break, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>apparently made a phone call as the I-man not doubt heard about to the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, and during the course of a conversation about something else, he mentioned to them that he was very happy that the owner signed their quarterback Michael Vick, who has been just tearing it up on the field, at least he was until a couple of days after this news came out. And he told him that he was glad, because a lot of ex-cons in society don't get a second chance, he was very happy for the success of Michael Vick and the fact that the guy gave him the opportunity and of course a lot of people really just can't believe that he made that kind of phony waded into this controversy unnecessarily.</p><p>IMUS: Plus he has a dog, doesn't he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Don't they have a dog?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's going to need a secret service himself now to protect him from the president.</p><p>IMUS: Michael Vick comes to the White House, well, that is unfair, that's not right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But yes, he does. And, of course, again as I said, that following Sunday, Vick played a terrible game. Not that the two had any connection.</p><p>IMUS: I don't see anything wrong with that. You don't think the president should have weighed in on it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, not at all. I think it's unnecessary again, it's just like the Beer Summit with the cop versus the Harvard professor. You just going to alienate a bunch of people, there's no reason that people now is going to take side, they'll going to hate -- if they needed a reason to hate <person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>this will give it to them, a lot of dog lovers, even though I agree, the guy deserves a second chance.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I don't know. That is working pretty hard trying to find something to wolf on Obama about.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I agree he deserves a second chance but the president should not.</p><p>IMUS: The president deserves a second chance, I'm going to give it to him now. You know, I shouldn't say this. But I actually feel like now, here in New York, we have a governor. I love David Paterson, that's sort of, I guess maybe that is not right. That's not right. Bo Dietl is coming up, we're going to talk to him. Actually, Santa brought you an extra ten pounds, huh?</p><p>RUFINO: Oh!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Thanks, Bernie. Bo Dietl is next. It's one of Peter Rodriguez's five favorite songs, Beatles.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCCORD: You think it, he says it. IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, time now for a business update, from the FOX Business Network, here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.

As -- there's a look at some of your top stories, more news coming up as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues, right now, with the check on the forecast.</p><p>SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast. You can see, we do still have rain showers here in the southwest, and snow showers in the higher elevations. Most of the U.S. is looking very clear, and as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain showers in New England along the coastline. The midsection, lots of sunshine, a slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis and as we look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to see many if any delays travel wise, because of the weather. Other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to the rain/snow mix. I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program, on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Eighteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.

I don't have the money anymore where I used to come in. I used to roll in, it doesn't roll any more. I got four iPads because you showed me this, thank God for credit cards, I got this 64 gigabyte with the Wi-Fi for my four children there. And they all got one and, you know what, we lost a great guy last year, George Steinbrenner. Now, I can tell the story. George Steinbrenner did for me like nobody else did for me. My daughter, Dana, who is the -- as a senior at the University of Tampa, at first when she tried to apply there, they only accepting a thousand students and her average was about 3.2, they told her, you have to go to another college and matriculate, she starts crying, dad, I wanted to go there, I wanted to go, I called Brandy Levine and asked Mr. Steinbrenner if he could maybe possibly help her get in. Mr. Steinbrenner got back to me and says, help her get in. Two days later, he was accepted into the University in Tampa. She now has a 4.0, she's on the Dean's list, honors society and she might become the valedictorian for the University of Tampa, my daughter Dana, I'm very proud.</p><p>IMUS: Pretty good, huh?</p><p>DIETL: And George Steinbrenner did it and my love out for the Steinbrenner family, a lot of people don't realize what he does. I sent him.</p><p>IMUS: Why did she want to go there?</p><p>DIETL: No. She's graduating.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, why did she want to go there?</p><p>DIETL: I don't know.

It is a very good school, she's doing teaching of disabled, you know, speech therapy, that kind of stuff, to teach people how to speak, she probably have to.</p><p>IMUS: Should have started with you?</p><p>DIETL: Yes, I know.

Put it this way, they look like a very good-looking version of a fat old man like me.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you are not an unattractive man but...</p><p>DIETL: Yes, so...</p><p>IMUS: Not as much an extra ten pounds but...</p><p>DIETL: All right. Well, you want to know something? I eat. I don't eat lamb's regurgitations and all that stuff like you do. Now, over the holidays.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you don't have cancer like I do.</p><p>DIETL: John Mariotti, it's called \"The Chinese Conspiracy,\" this book is for you.</p><p>IMUS: No, don't give to it me. I won't read it.</p><p>DIETL: OK.</p><p>IMUS: I don't want it.</p><p>DIETL: OK. Well, can I talk about it? Because it's a great novel.</p><p>IMUS: Talk about what you want.</p><p>DIETL: OK. \"The Chinese Conspiracy\" by John Mariotti is a new novel that is out but the novel is based on a lot of facts. We know what happened with the Pentagon, with the breaking into the Supernet computers and all of that kind of stuff, the Chinese.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>DIETL: But this talks about a group of young Chinese guys that wanted to overthrow the old Ancient guard of China. So, what they do is they infiltrate all of our systems, all of our technologies systems, our grid and everything, and they shut down, they shut down the American -- all the IT., all the planes.</p><p>IMUS: What happens?</p><p>DIETL: What?</p><p>IMUS: How does this happen that somebody gets this -- do you know this guy?</p><p>DIETL: I don't know this guy but I'm going to tell you something. I can, I find a book, because.</p><p>IMUS: You can't.</p><p>DIETL: One of your yak-swallowing friends over there, one of your liberal friends, they come over here.</p><p>IMUS: Yak-swallowing friends.</p><p>DIETL: But this guys from \"Newsweek,\" news day, all of the liberal pieces of garbage, they give you something that is OK, this is a great novel because based it's based on fact, \"The Chinese Conspiracy,\" it's about reality, if Greenfield is sitting there, like this, blah, blah, then it would be good.

You were going around quoting me, saying stuff that I never said. I didn't want you to stick up for me, I didn't need to be stuck up for. I didn't want people going around and making any excuses for me. There wasn't any excuse, there is no excuse now. Your mic has been off for five minutes -- a minute.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DIETL: You sit on the board of the directors, you shouldn't be talking about.</p><p>IMUS: Hang on a minute.

Who gave it to you, some friend of yours?</p><p>DIETL: He's a friend of Admiral Straw.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>DIETL: And I was at the Army-Navy game and he has a hat like you wear.</p><p>IMUS: That's not a hat like I wear.</p><p>DIETL: Well, it looks like some.</p><p>IMUS: No, it's not.</p><p>DIETL: All right. OK. And he signed you the book, I'm going to tell you about something, you talk about novel.</p><p>IMUS: He signed the book to me because he wants me to plug the book.</p><p>DIETL: No, you don't have to.</p><p>IMUS: Which I'm not now going to do, because I'm so offended that you attacked me.</p><p>DIETL: I challenged you to read this Don, because it is based on the facts about them taking over.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I'm sure it's fine.</p><p>DIETL: Taking over our country, stopping all our airlines, all our aviation, all our grid, all of that.

Coming up on five minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I was telling Charles Rangel and the Gangster Mickey that I don't weigh myself very often, occasionally I do. I weighed myself this morning and I'm about, I'm not quite 6 feet tall and I weigh 153 pounds. But because of the way I wear my wranglers, if I weigh 153 pounds and not 150 pounds, I can't get them on. So, it was just my struggle this morning.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Jeff Greenfield.</p><p>MCCORD: A lot of issues.</p><p>IMUS: And Mary Matalin are both coming up, Gangster Mickey and Charles Rangel, all that, just ahead.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS, IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Hard to get on with the depends.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: Hard to get on over the depends.</p><p>IMUS: What did you say?</p><p>BARTLETT: Hard to get on over the depends!</p><p>IMUS: Did I tell you what happened, I e-mail either one about Wyatt's horse?</p><p>BARTLETT: No.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God. This is a horrible story. At the ranch, he gets up at 5:00 in the morning, to go out at the barn with the cowboys, and they feed all the animals. Colder than hell, it's just miserable. So, the Sunday after Christmas, there wasn't anybody there, so he does it. Even though he's only 12, he can still drive the feed truck, I mean, so we bought him his roping horse, buster, great roping horse, potentially great last summer. He goes up to the barn, he finds the horse dead in the stall.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, no.</p><p>IMUS: The horse actually out in the run -- there's (inaudible) runs outside the stall, some barns. Anyway, the horse is on his back with his leg stuck through the gate, dead. So, he comes back, running down to the house, screaming. You can imagine. His mother and I are asleep and I couldn't, I thought it was one of the dogs have died, I couldn't imagine it was his horse died. So, we buried it and put a little note in with it and oh, great.</p><p>MCCORD: It's hard.</p><p>IMUS: Between the animals and I.</p><p>IMUS: What did they -- hi, happy New Year. What did they do when I was gone, Connell? Did you and Dagen fill in?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. We did you know the old \"BEST OF IMUS\", had some live guests and also tossed to some of your segments, so yes it was Dagen and -- and me. We each took a couple days off around Christmas but we were both here for some of the days.</p><p>IMUS: You know actually, you guys are pretty good.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, thanks. Seriously?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, why?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, I'm just trying to say do you really mean that?</p><p>IMUS: Why you'd think we would have you on the program if we didn't think you were good.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right. That's true.</p><p>IMUS: We could be wrong.</p><p>MCSHANE: As I said to you in the e-mail, where would you be without me? Now that the rating is coming up and everything --</p><p>IMUS: We'd be number one and not number two.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes exactly.</p><p>IMUS: That where we would be.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's -- that was your response.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. Jeff Greenfield of CBS News and Mary Matalin, is I know what she's -- she's the former advisor to Darth Vader, Dick Cheney. And that's -- well, they are all coming up.</p><p>So -- anyway it's time for a little business news, and here to weary out with that is Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'll do my best. Good morning, I-Man.</p><p>Now, the markets here real quick for you this morning are really -- actually looking pretty good to start off the New Year with a survey that came out of China, that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months, but that has eased some of the concerns about inflation over there and markets around the world are higher.</p><p>We'll go to Asia, first of all and show that the Chinese market, the bottom of the screen, the Shanghai composite was up one and three quarters percent overnight; Hong Kong and South Korea -- those are the other markets on the screen -- were also up; and Japan has not yet resumed trading for the New Year.</p><p>In Europe this morning stocks are gaining ground; London is closed for a New Year's holiday but Paris is up almost two percent -- it was up more than percent earlier so it's off the highs; and Germany up by 1.3 percent. So a pretty good start to the day.</p><p>Now, our futures in the U.S. indicating the open on Wall Street, in two- and-a-half hours could be higher. We're up 64 points on DOW futures. And in terms of how we finished 2010, remember it was good year for stocks. I mean, the major indexes were higher, the DOW by 11 percent, the S&amp;P by nearly 13 percent and the NASDAQ, the best of the bunch, up almost 17 percent in 2010.</p><p>Now when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California Congressman Darrell Issa gets a big promotion.

DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: We have about $1.7 trillion worth of regulatory costs already in the government. If the President wants to throw another $300 billion or $400 billion, what he is doing is taking it right out of businesses, right out of employment, right out of competitiveness. We need to make sure we can compete.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Now Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings, as committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also, Medicare.</p><p>We're starting off the New Year with a busy week on the economic calendar meantime.

Aren't they?</p><p>WOLF: Oh terrible, change the rule. Just because you win the division, nothing, if you have a losing record, you're out and you are replaced by a non-playoff team with the best record.</p><p>IMUS: Why because the Giants are 10 -- 10-6.</p><p>WOLF: Yes and as are the Buccaneers.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: I mean, the point is you want the best teams in there -- who cares - -</p><p>IMUS: Why are -- why are the Seahawks so awful?</p><p>WOLF: Well, the quarterback is no great shakes any more, Hasselbeck. The best player is Leon Washington, the kickoff return man they got from the Jets. And they're in the worst division --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: -- in the NFL.</p><p>IMUS: So Pete Carroll hasn't made any difference going there?</p><p>WOLF: No not this year, but he'll say, we don't care, we won the division.</p><p>IMUS: Right. The fans -- or some of the fans did in a poll they took, didn't want them to win. Did you know that?</p><p>WOLF: No, well they bet on the rain --</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know what the deal was.</p><p>All right, six minutes after the hour. And for the millions of you who of course can't function in life without knowing how I am --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- and -- and many of you who idolize me, which I -- I can understand.</p><p>MCCORD: Hell, the I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: -- because people in this country no longer have any taste. That's the reason. I'm more successful now than I have ever been.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCORD: And demonstrated by the ratings.</p><p>IMUS: Which -- which demonstrates the clear decline of our society as we know it.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh yes.</p><p>IMUS: But I had this biopsy on the 17th of December and that is why I was not here so, to determine if in fact these things I had on my vocal cord were cancerous. And apparently they are not.</p><p>MCCORD: Good.</p><p>IMUS: But I had it over at Mt. Sinai but Dr. Wu did the biopsy. He's a great surgeon, doctor, and another guy who is fabulous, is a -- is a guy by the name of Dr. Allen Reid, who is an anesthesiologist. Fabulous.</p><p>And you know, I'm a big fan of Hackensack and -- and -- and also Cornell, but Mt. Sinai is a great hospital, starting with the nurses. And it was under general anesthesia, and what apparently I have are pre-cancerous cells. But -- but I got to thinking about it, all cells are pre-cancerous, aren't they, but some are farther along the road than others.</p><p>MCCORD: Certainly.</p><p>IMUS: So the ones that I have are as far along the road as you want them to get.</p><p>MCCORD: Before getting rid of them.</p><p>IMUS: Before getting rid of them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: So now they have to go on with the laser and laser them off.</p><p>MCCORD: \"Star Wars\" them off there like that.</p><p>IMUS: And which is according to Dr. Wu, who is a -- who is peek-a-boo Wu, who is fabulous by the way. It's an office thing, so -- apparently, I know that is too much information for you.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes it is.</p><p>IMUS: Apparently, I'm fine.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And my voice is a little hoarse, but --</p><p>MCCORD: Not horrible.</p><p>IMUS: Not horrible.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: Here's Chuck with the news.

The grapevine area of I-5 closed indefinitely right now after cars began slipping and sliding all over the place. One driver says it was in fact pretty bad.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We found out about 15 minutes after I passed the detour, so I could have saved myself a lot of time, but instead we spent an hour-and-a-half of gridlock and now we have to go right back where we came from, so I'm feeling a little silly about that.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: Winds were gusting to 90 miles an hour.

New York Senator Chuck Schumer worked hard to get the bill passed.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: It's been a long and arduous journey and lots of us played a role, but the real credit goes to those first responders.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: The President signed the measure privately in Hawaii and issued a statement praising as he put it, \"The selfless courage demonstrated by the firefighters, police officers and first responders who risked their lives\".</p><p>The bill provides $4.2 billion in aid to sickened workers and a few hundred people who live near the burning pile at the Ground Zero, the Trade Center site.</p><p>Jerry Brown, being sworn in as the Governor of California today, replacing Governor Schwarzenegger; the ceremony takes place, downtown Sacramento this morning with a reception scheduled then for late this afternoon.</p><p>Top Democrats says the President will work --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Reception.</p><p>MCCORD: Reception. Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why would they be having a reception?</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it's a big deal.</p><p>IMUS: Spend money on that.</p><p>MCCORD: That's a good point. Why -- why and in that state --</p><p>IMUS: Aren't they about $90 trillion in debt?</p><p>MCCORD: I think, $96 trillion, in the last -- in the last estimate. But you're absolutely right.</p><p>IMUS: What a mess.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK: It will be bring your own booze and crackers.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes and brown bag in it.</p><p>IMUS: Well --</p><p>MCCORD: And the top Democrat says the President will work with the Republican Congress but don't -- that doesn't mean he's going to buckle to them. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine saying that there will be disagreements.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TIM KAINE, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: If the Republicans are willing to work as they did at the end of that lame duck session I think we will see productive efforts in a number of ways.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: Kaine pointed to recent compromises on tax cuts, and this new START treaty as proof of the possibility at least of some demonstration of bipartisanship.</p><p>And researchers are making progress on a blood test that is interesting, to say the least. They say this will be able to spot a single cancer cell among as many as a billion healthy ones. The health care company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the giant company says it will join scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital where the test was invented, to try to bring this thing to market within the next several years.</p><p>Researchers think the test has the potential at least to transform care of many types of cancer, especially breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer. Doctors hope to use it to determine what treatment would be best for any particular tumor or set of tumors.</p><p>Magnitude 7.1 earthquake, southern Chile, yesterday, prompted tens of thousands to flee the coast for higher ground thinking that it might be generating another tsunami like the one that ravaged the area last year.

Well, not the genetic lottery, but the geographical lottery --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- by -- and then have to endure this.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Like Haiti, for example.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: And Africa and -- these various places around the world, just get -- but just get screwed by one hideous catastrophe after another.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: It is 13 after the hour; Warner, do you have sports?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. We'll get to that in a second first, let's check the business news and with that, Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Ok, good morning, I-Man.</p><p>The market coming up at 11 percent gain in 2010 at least for the DOW and nearly 17 percent rise for the NASDAQ, up again this morning indicating the New Year will start off on a good note.</p><p>Then, there's a big story in the \"New York Times\" this morning about Facebook, Goldman Sachsmaking a $500 million investment in Facebook according to \"The Times\" and a Russian investor also making a sizable investment and so the -- the value of Facebook according to these investments would now be around $50 billion.</p><p>So Facebook would be worth more as \"The Times\" points out, than big tech companies like eBay and Yahoo! and many others, but anyway, Facebook which has obviously been a hot company for some time is getting a big investment now from the -- one of the best known firms on -- or the best known firm on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: And the -- the two twins from Harvard who are -- the rowing twins out there in San Diego.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- who are suing what's his name?</p><p>MCSHANE: Zuckerberg.</p><p>IMUS: Yes they must be happy about this latest development.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, we'll see. Well, they want -- they want their suit, they settled it already for tens of millions of dollars but they want it now to be thrown out so that their shares can be valued higher but Facebook has won every legal challenge of that case which is of course the subject of the movie, the \"Social Network\".</p><p>IMUS: Well, the Connell McShane business report sponsored by Gorilla Trades. Get powerful stock picks for 30 days, sign up now at GorillaTrades.com. It's 14 after the hour.</p><p>Well, Charles had reported that the 9/11 responder bill was signed and \"The New York Times\" had what I thought was kind of an amusing article, particularly for those of us who are fans of Jon Stewart. I suspect Mr. Stewart probably thought it was amusing as well, but Bill Carter who writes all of these books about the late night wars as though somebody cares -- judging by the best-seller list, no one does.</p><p>Compared Mr. Stewart to Everett R. Murrow, which because of Mr. Stewart's rants about the Republicans, who wouldn't support the 9/11 responders bill and which I thought he was right about. But, I thought what made the Republicans come around, of course, Bernie's now claiming that they were able to get $3 billion out of the bill, so that they were -- so that they would pass it. But, whether they would have got that out or not, they were shamed into passing it.</p><p>But I thought when Shep Smith from Fox News was on Fox News, of course. And he had seen the Jon Stewart Show the night before. And so he was talking about it. And when -- he did this spontaneous wrap about how shameful it was that the Republicans were dragging their feet, refusing to pass the bill, and I saw him when he did it. And it appeared to be spontaneous but, in my view, the Republicans watching this could have endured Jon Stewart ragging on them and would have, because it happens all the time.</p><p>But, boy, I would be willing to bet when they turned on Fox News with the huge audience that they have and here's Shep Smith with his -- huge audience that he has. And they lost him, then they've lost the fight. Here's Shep Smith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Last night on Jon Stewart -- it was Jon Stewart's last show of the week and ok, we watched it, whatever. And he just flat on -- absolutely right and it's worth saying, who's going to hold these people's feet to the fire when we're able to put a 52-story building down there so far at Ground Zero.</p><p>We're able to pay for tax cuts from billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the economy but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire? Went down there to save people?</p><p>Did people know what the city was like that day; people walking over bridges, they were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying. Their family members were dead and these people ran to Ground Zero to save people's lives. And we're not going to give them medicine for the illnesses they got down there?</p><p>It is disgusting, it's a national disgrace. It's a shame and everybody who voted against it should have to stand up and account for him or herself. Is anybody going to hold them accountable?</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I think you just did.</p><p>SMITH: I'm not really in a position to do that. I mean I think I just kind of went out there and said what the truth is. And I feel like, I feel like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people.</p><p>There was no warning label on Ground Zero, on 9/11 that these substances will kill you. And even if there had been they would have gone anyway. They just need a little bit of help.</p><p>It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do, doing anything for those people, don't we?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: That is Shep Smith, Fox News. That is big time -- tell me about Fox News.</p><p>MCGUIRK: With Chris Wallace.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Well, he's just sitting there, sucking his thumb --</p><p>MCGUIRK: You had brought that up with Chris Wallace prior to that conversation and then that following Sunday, Chris Wallace brought it up to several politician on his program as well.</p><p>IMUS: That is big time, Shep Smith. You know, and all the Lobster Newburghs of the world. Those of you who run around and won't watch Fox News --</p><p>MCCORD: Pay attention.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, pay attention. They're not doing that -- I didn't see Diane Sawyer doing that. I didn't see that wimp, who by the way won't be in the \"Profiles in Courage\" book, Brian Williams. I didn't see him or the little rodent over there at CBS doing anything.</p><p>Did you? Did you see any of them? Did they have a word to say about that? Who did have a word to say about it? Shep Smith.</p><p>So -- 19 after the hour. Get to Warner in sports in a minute. Calm down.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCSHANE: In the news this morning, Expedia dropping American Airlines fares from its Web site.

Thank you, I-man.</p><p>Well, completing the play-off picture last night, the Seahawks finishing 7- 9, beat the Rams 16-6; they win the NFC west. And as you said, even the Seattle fans wanted the Seahawks to lose so they would get a higher draft pick.</p><p>The Packers win the wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3. The Colts win the AFC south, beating the Titans, 23-20. Although they didn't know it at the time, they had already won it minutes earlier because the Jags lost. Steelers win the AFC. Falcons win the NFC.</p><p>And finally, I-man, MVP, there's going to be no question about it, Tom Brady finishes with 36 touchdowns and just four interceptions.</p><p>IMUS: How did he play -- he's playing better than he ever has.</p><p>WOLF: Ever, all-time. Not anytime.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>WOLF: Not every time --</p><p>IMUS: That will be fine.</p><p>WOLF: Not Greenwich Time.</p><p>IMUS: That will be fine. Time for a little business news now, oh, my God. And here with that is the girl with the purple dress on, purple rain, purple rain. Dagen McDowell -- good morning Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir. I was trying to get all gussied up for your return.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm glad you did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. At least I came back from Christmas with all my teeth because there's always that danger.</p><p>IMUS: How would you lose your teeth?</p><p>MCDOWELL: A fight, fall down or there's always that, you know, peanut brittle sitting around the house.</p><p>IMUS: Or Santa come down that chimney and you're there under the tree and haven't been rubbing that Chamonix on yourself and so Santa would be disappointed, wouldn't he? And look like you been left out in the rain, girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He would punch me -- would punch me in the mouth.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let's hope not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: For not keeping my skin soft and supple.</p><p>IMUS: Well, anyway, what's going on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. The movie business was boo -- bad last year. Overall attendance was down more than 5 percent; the lowest number of tickets sold to the movies since 1996. Now, total revenue was north of $10 billion because ticket prices are higher. People are going to 3-D movies, which cost more money, but one, one notable disappointment was that Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolie movie \"The Tourist\" at end of the year. So, I reckon paying have gotten tired of paying to see that hussy with the puffy lips stand around.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you offing (ph) on her.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: You don't like her --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't. No, not at all.</p><p>IMUS: You know who seems kind of cute is Reese Witherspoon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, that movie didn't do so well either; that new movie that she's in.</p><p>IMUS: She's going to marry her agent, you know. Did you know that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Yes, I did. Jim Toff (ph) is his name, by the way.</p><p>IMUS: And how about Shania Twain?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Getting married to the ex-husband of the woman that Mutt Lang, Shania's ex-husband, left her for. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Now, that's a trailer park --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RUFINO: I'm my own grandpa right there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you know what? That's why you got to love her.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. All's well that ends well. She grew up hard knocks, man. Now she's found love.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, I know she did. Yes. I thought she's good. I've always liked her, but the girl -- she married Mutt Lange who produced all her records.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And he -- didn't he produce Def Leppard for a long time?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, he did.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Foreigner.</p><p>IMUS: Foreigner. So he's a great record producer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: But apparently that wasn't enough and she wasn't enough. So he was having an affair with her assistant, right, or his assistant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. She was like the house manager, I thought, something like that.</p><p>IMUS: OK. And so, Shania, of course, found out about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it was Shania's best friend.</p><p>IMUS: And Shania's best friend. Sure.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: So he was always there, that's unfortunate. So now, are they married now?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know if they're married.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now, but that woman's ex-husband, they are married, OK. Mutt and the woman -- Mutt and the woman are married and the woman's ex-husband just married Shania.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel dizzy right now.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: Now, Shania, she's down in Nashville. There's a bunch of people available, a bunch of these good looking cowboy singers. And I just, I just didn't understand that. That's sort of screwed up, isn't it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, he's hot.</p><p>IMUS: He is?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The guy she married is smoking, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's like -- yes, he's European looking. He's --</p><p>IMUS: He's cute?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, all right. Well, never mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And those cowboys will cheat on you quicker than they'll sneeze, so why drive down that road again?</p><p>IMUS: Well, Mutt Lange is not a cowboy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know, but the cowboys will cheat, too. Find a man who will stay honest to you.</p><p>IMUS: Like Tim McGraw, he married, down the road with what's her name. Figure, well, why not, so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What a tough decision for him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Faith Hill or hmmm -- I wonder --</p><p>IMUS: Years ago -- years ago, my brother and Phil Sweet wrote a song called \"\"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You, which eventually went to number one. It won the Music City News Record of the Year, country record, and is recorded by Jim Ed Brown of The Browns, you know. And Helen Cornelius.</p><p>Now, Helen, she was married. Well, you know where this story is going. And so was Jim, he was married. But they get this big hit record \"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You\", I don't want to have to say I do. And so they're on tour and they're on the bus and they discovered some -- one of them, one of the husbands or either her husband or his wife discovered that between the two compartments on the bus where Jim Ed Brown would sleep and where the other compartment where old Helen was asleep, there was a trap door.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: No way.</p><p>IMUS: There's like a, where your dog comes in and out. So one of them was wiggling through the trap door.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, for crying out loud.</p><p>IMUS: I don't want to have to marry you.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. I don't have to go through that trap door.</p><p>IMUS: Man, oh, man.</p><p>All right, 33 after the hour. Jeff Greenfield is coming up. But first, time for a briefing sponsored by our friends at P.C. Richard &amp; Son. And here with that is Bernard McGuirk.</p><p>Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yo, chief. Well, a lot happened since the break began for us a couple of weeks ago. The Bush tax cuts extended, \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" repealed. The death panels are back and Obamacare and the blizzard of 2010 further revealed Mayor Mike Bloomberg could be the arrogant schmuck we all knew he was.</p><p>IMUS: Two best news. The \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and the 9/11 responder bill.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. That was signed just yesterday by the president in Hawaii, robbing Chuck Schumer of his moment in the spotlight. He couldn't be there at the signing. However, before all this happened, Larry King signed off and during that show, a funny thing happened while Larry King was interviewing Bill Clinton which pretty much went unnoticed. They were talking about both being heart surgeon patients, members of the \"zipper club\" but that was a little confusing. But here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOICE OF: LARRY KING, HOST, \"LARRY KING LIVE\": You look well fit. Are you feeling well?</p><p>VOICE OF: BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I feel great. I've been traveling quite a bit, but as you pointed out I just got back from Haiti. And I'm kind of like you, I have to keep working. I don't know if it keeps me young, but at least it keeps me out of the grave.</p><p>KING: We're both in the \"zipper club.\" By the way, the suits want me to remind you what the \"zipper club\" is. It's if you've had open heart surgery, they have to zipper it up. So I thought everyone in the world knew it but apparently --</p><p>CLINTON: I'm glad you clarified that.</p><p>KING: I see what you mean. Oh, oh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: The big dog acknowledging and can be self-deprecating at this point.</p><p>IMUS: Of course, we lost a character when Larry -- what's Larry going to do now?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, he's still going to work. He's going to be a contributor.</p><p>He better, right. He has to be.</p><p>IMUS: Wasn't he ragging on Hannity and Rachel Maddow?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He did somewhere. I read something about that. He was --</p><p>IMUS: Both of them were kicking his ass, by the way. Hannity by a lot and her by some.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Hannity drove Larry King off the air, essentially.</p><p>IMUS: So he gets on. He's bad-mouthing Rachel Maddow and Hannity who were both killing him.</p><p>All right, Greenfield is next. Twenty-five until the hour.</p><p>MUSIC: Oh, I love the clothes she wears and the way the sunlight plays upon her hair. Oh, I hear the sound of a church bell off the wind that lifts her perfume through the air. I'm picking up good vibrations. She's giving me the excitations. I'm picking up good vibrations.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm so irritable this morning that I just don't know if I can recover.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: The bailout program for boring radio.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the FOX Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: All right. Here's your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>As many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's day, there was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock features. Users have set their alarm for a single wakeup. Found it didn't go off when 2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all alarms will work properly starting today. But apparently users in Europe and Asia say they are still having some problems.</p><p>Vizio, the maker of inexpensive flat-screen TVs looking now to expand. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell phones and tablet computers. The two products, the Via Phone and the Via Tablet will be introduced this summer from the company. The announcement comes days ahead of the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.</p><p>As for the markets this morning, let's check in on the futures once again. They've been higher all morning long. Dow futures now up by 84 points as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p>SHAY RYAN, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning. I'm meteorologist Shay Ryan from FOX 5 in New York with your national forecast.</p><p>You can see we do still have rain showers here in the southwest and snow showers in the higher elevations. Most of the U.S. is looking very clear. And as we look to the northeast, again we do have some light snow showers and some rain showers in New England along the coastline. The midsection, lots of sunshine. A slight chance for some snow in Minneapolis. And as we look at the top five travel cities across the U.S., I don't think you're going to see very many if any delays travel-wise because of the weather, other than possibly in the southwest section of the U.S. due to that rain- snow mix.</p><p>I'm Shay Ryan for the IMUS IN THE MORNING news program on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Nineteen until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Mary Matlin is coming up. Tomorrow, Tom Friedman. And then on Wednesday, Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus, \"Blond on Blond.\" This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by Time Warner cable business class. You first, the technology follows.</p><p>Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from CBS News, Jeff Greenfield. Good morning, Mr. Greenfield.</p><p>JEFF GREENFIELD, CBS NEWS (via telephone): Good morning, Don. Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Happy New Year to you. I apologize for being late.</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know, it's -- I mean, I would not have missed the conversation about all those country stars and their lives for anything. So it was fine, you know?</p><p>IMUS: I sense a note of sarcasm in your voice.</p><p>GREENFIELD: No. Me, on this show? Don't be silly.</p><p>IMUS: It just hurts my feelings because --</p><p>GREENFIELD: No, you are the audio version of Oprah's new network. Nothing but good feelings.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder how that's going to work out for her.</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know, I don't know. It's in a way unprecedented that an entire network is built around the appeal of one person although she's hardly, you know, your ordinary figure. And I guess it involves everything from whether or not some of her viewers are going to want to pay the extra fee. She's not on pay cable, but on a lot of network, a lot of cable systems she's not on the basic cable. There is some fluff about that. And the real question is, I guess, can you sustain 24 hours based on the world view of one person although as I say in her case that's just one extraordinary media figure. I mean, she certainly has built something over the years that is just unprecedented in, you know, media. So good luck to her.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I like her. I don't know why I like her. I don't watch her show, I just like her.</p><p>GREENFIELD: She's a -- I can say -- I think, I think you don't connect at that level with so many people at that level of intensity unless there's something there, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe Barbara Walters should have asked her if she was a lesbian?</p><p>GREENFIELD: I don't know, Don. Let me take that under prayerful consideration.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder what you thought. I didn't so, I like Barbara Walters, too.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, OK.</p><p>IMUS: So the 9/11 responders bill is signed that finally, huh?</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, and I think you were very wise in showing that clip from Shep Smith, because I think between him and Stuart, you had -- I think Shep is a straight arrow newscaster, but certainly the FOX Network is watched overwhelmingly by folks of a conservative persuasion and Stuart's show is watched overwhelmingly by folks with a liberal persuasion. When you have people on both sides coming at that issue and basically saying shame to the people who voted against it, I think those twin factors played a big role in getting that bill through.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know if many Democrats watch FOX News somewhere?</p><p>GREENFIELD: No, they do, because, first of all, FOX News as a cable network is by far the most watched cable network, and it isn't that Democrats don't watch it. But in the surveys that I have seen over the years and it shouldn't surprise anybody, the predominantly majority view of those who watch tends to the right. It's just the predominant view of those who watch MSNBC tends to the left. And this is about reassurance and reaffirmation of what you believe is right.</p><p>I may have told you the story. I talked once to a Democratic senator who told me that the television set is always on at MSNBC at home. And I said why after 12 hours of debate in the Senate, you go home and watch more politics? And the answer was, it's like soaking in a nice warm bath, you know. And I think that's true for a lot of people who turn on a cable news network, that basically tells them what you basically think that's right. And I think it's one of the reasons why my former places of business, CNN, had such a prime time ratings. There are a lot of others, but people basically I think, that is to say the people who watch cable news, and remember it's a big minority of television viewers. You're talking about three percent of, you know, television homes. Folks turn that stuff on either to be told they're right or in the case of, you know, Democrats watching FOX or Republicans watching MSNBC to get the blood going.</p><p>IMUS: I was so happy we were able to get you away from CNN over to CBS. I can't tell you.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, I'm sure you played your part.</p><p>IMUS: I hated the fact. Well, I kept saying to Rick Kaplan, who was a big fan of yours, by the way, as are a lot of people.</p><p>GREENFIELD: He's now one of my bosses. He's the executive producer of Katie Couric's show.</p><p>IMUS: Why wouldn't you be -- why wouldn't we get Greenfield over to CBS News and get him out of that hell hole over there.</p><p>GREENFIELD: The only thing I can tell you is the cafeteria at CNN was much better than the cafeteria at CBS.</p><p>IMUS: Did you watch the Rose Bowl?</p><p>GREENFIELD: I did, that's my alma mater.</p><p>IMUS: That's what I asked.</p><p>GREENFIELD: I thought it was a really good game. I was the only big 10 team that was competitive I think in all those -- how many bowl games are there now? About 35 quite literally?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD: So it's one missed field goal.</p><p>IMUS: That was my only connection to the game is I knew that you had gone to school there before you went to Harvard or Yale, wherever the hell you went.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, right.</p><p>IMUS: And that they were playing TCU. Of course, I was rooting for TCU, but that's just because I'm a big Texas fan. So --</p><p>GREENFIELD: Well, Bob Schieffer is. In fact, I regretted the fact that he and I didn't get a bet down. Although now that Wisconsin lost, I don't know would have had to -- I don't know what I would have had to do, you know, appeared on the air in a TCU warm-up jacket. I guess that was a really good game and I must say that, you know, I didn't, I didn't call the University of Wisconsin in high dungeon and say no more contributions from me because you lost the football game. That's perhaps taking it a bit too far.</p><p>IMUS: If you're one of the people like I am who thinks that Sarah Palin is -- I don't know if I think she's a dope or not, but whatever. But let me ask you this, how much worse off would the country or better off would the country be where she president?</p><p>GREENFIELD: You know what?</p><p>IMUS: The answer is not --</p><p>GREENFIELD: First of all -- no, first, she's dumb like a fox. I mean, here's somebody who's turned the governorship of Alaska and an unsuccessful bid for vice-president into a multi-million dollar empire where she gets to talk only to people who like her for $100,000 a more pop, you know, is a favorite on the most watched cable news network in the country and makes millions of dollars selling books. This is how dumb she is.</p><p>IMUS: Very good.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, that's --</p><p>Two Cadillacs outside.</p><p>IMUS: You remember.</p><p>GREENFIELD: Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking of when people talk about how dumb he is, that preacher guy.</p><p>One of my favorite routines. But you know, that's a question probably better asked to people who -- who would ideologically tend to be on her side. I think it's really interesting that either a majority or maybe close to of Republicans don't think she's qualified to be president.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GREENFIELD: So what she has is an enormously intensely loyal base of people who like her and think any criticism of her is just an example of left wing media bias.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe it's a little like Oprah. We all like her but we just don't want her to run anything.</p><p>All right. I've got to go, but thank you very much.</p><p>GREENFIELD: -- that analogy completely, but I do think that she's going to have a significant role whether she's a candidate or not in 2012.</p><p>IMUS: All right. I've got to go.</p><p>GREENFIELD: OK. Well, Happy New Year and it's two months to start plugging my book like a banshee (ph).</p><p>IMUS: I will do anything for you. Jeff Greenfield, CBS News.</p><p>MUSIC: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: The stocks starting off the new year with some gains here. The monthly survey coming out of China showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months and that actually is easing some inflation concerns and some optimism about our economy as well, ahead of some key economic data points later in the week. Europe is up across the board. London is closed today for the New Year's holiday. And our futures are up across the board. The Dow futures ahead of the open on Wall Street now up almost triple digits. So we're adding to the gains as we get closer to the open.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants to put on the market.

And it is. And gold after being lower earlier has now turned slightly higher.</p><p>More news coming up at the top of the hour but it's IMUS IN THE MORNING that continues right now. FOX Business, power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: We got so far behind. So what are you saying now? We haven't lost Larry King?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So this is pathetic.</p><p>BARTLETT: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Can't you come up with something else? You're a professional comedian.</p><p>BARTLETT: I happen to come up with something else. He's a great character. You don't want to lose him.</p><p>MCCORD: He's still going to be around doing specials and stuff. He's just not going to have a show.</p><p>TONY POWELL: You're going to make him to do whatever --</p><p>BARTLETT: We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>BARTLETT: We did Nixon 10 years after he died.</p><p>IMUS: Well, yes, but that's different.</p><p>MCCORD: That's Nixon.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, it's Nixon.</p><p>IMUS: It's Nixon.</p><p>MCCORD: No, but you --</p><p>IMUS: You're saying we can still do Larry King?</p><p>BARTLETT: Why not? It's not like he's dead.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, he is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: But that's been for a while.</p><p>IMUS: He's a no-good bastard, by the way.</p><p>MCCORD: Who?</p><p>IMUS: Larry King. I used to be friends with him, but he's a creep. And his wife is a bigger creep.</p><p>POWELL: What are you saying?</p><p>BARTLETT: How about Rex Ryan?</p><p>IMUS: What about him?</p><p>BARTLETT: Him as a character.</p><p>IMUS: That's a weird dude, you know that.</p><p>BARTLETT: You think.</p><p>IMUS: No, but I mean, that toe-sucking thing?</p><p>BARTLETT: Well, that was, you know --</p><p>IMUS: Don't you think that's --</p><p>BARTLETT: I think what's interesting at first is the tripping controversy.</p><p>IMUS: And that girl got some fudgy feet, too, by the way. Did you see her feet?</p><p>MCCORD: Saw the photographs, yes.</p><p>IMUS: She should be wearing brogans.</p><p>IMUS: So I said to Carly (ph), how are you, happy New Year. So I say to Carly, I want a -- I'm drinking this tea that is supposed to kill cancer cells.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So -- and I'm happy to do it. So I said I wanted another cup. So she just brings over an empty cup, you know --</p><p>MCSHANE: Good for her. You deserve that.</p><p>IMUS: But I -- because I didn't specify what I wanted.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But it turns out we're out of the tea, so -- anyway, Seahawks won the football game last night, in case you just turned your -- whatever you have on, on. Your toaster.</p><p>MCSHANE: Your toaster.</p><p>IMUS: And --</p><p>MCSHANE: Seven and nine in the playoffs.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, which doesn't make any sense to me, but I don't care. So, are you a football fan, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, I'm a Jet fan. I was at the Jet game yesterday with my son and it was fun. And they won their -- well, they were already in the playoffs, but they won. So they go 11-5.</p><p>IMUS: Why would you pick a game to go to that meant nothing?</p><p>MCSHANE: Because you know why -- that's actually a good point. But we hadn't been to a game at the new stadium yet. So I decided on Saturday, the weather wasn't going to be too cold and he had never been to a game at the new stadium, so let's go. So we went.</p><p>IMUS: What kind of seats did you have?</p><p>MCSHANE: We had good seats. We were right behind -- they were actually in the second row -- they were technically in the 11th row but they were right behind the tunnel, you know, where the players run in. So they were in the second row behind that tunnel in the end zone and three of the touchdowns were right in our end zone, right where we were sitting. So it was pretty cool.</p><p>IMUS: Did you buy the tickets?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I bought them on -- I just bought them on Stub Hub the day before the game, online.</p><p>IMUS: Wouldn't there be some way, if you were going to go, you could -- you could let me know and then we could call Warner --</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And have you sit in the box with the owner?</p><p>MCSHANE: You know what, but then I'd owe you something.</p><p>IMUS: You owe me a lot now, by the way, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I do. Yes, I do.</p><p>IMUS: It's time for a little business news now and here is Connell McShane.</p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: I didn't want to add to it.</p><p>Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Now, let's look at the markets here this morning to see how things are starting off the week. Stocks -- starting off the year, really. It's the first trading day of the year with some gains. There's a monthly survey out of China that showed manufacturing slipped for the first time in five months, and that's easing concerns about inflation. If you look at Asia, for example, the Shanghai composite, the Chinese market at the bottom of the screen, up 1.75 percent. Kospi in South Korea, Hang Seng in Hong Kong all up on the day. Japan has not yet resumed trading in the new year.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are up. London's close also today because of the New Year's holiday. Paris is up 2 percent. Look at that. Germany up 1.3 percent. And our futures indicating the open on Wall Street in an hour and a half is going to be significantly higher. Dow futures up almost triple digits, up 92 points.</p><p>All right. Now, in terms of how we fared last year, as it is, in 2010, there's the recap. The Dow up 11 percent. The S&amp;P almost 13 percent. And the Nasdaq, the best of the bunch, higher by almost 17 percent.</p><p>The White House wants Congress to let the federal government take on even more debt. The national debt is getting closer to the $14.3 trillion ceiling. White House Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Austan Goolsbee on ABC \"This Week\" saying it's crucial that ceiling is raised.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: This is not a game. You know, the debt ceiling is not -- is not something to toy with. That's the -- the -- if we hit the debt ceiling, that's the -- essentially defaulting on our obligations, which is totally unprecedented in American history. The impact on the economy would be catastrophic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Many Republicans agree that it needs to be raised, but many are also saying they wouldn't go along with that unless they get promises to change Washington's spending habits. They argue there's no point in even having a debt ceiling if it's simply raised every time the national debt gets close.</p><p>Bank of America taking a $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter. It's related to mortgages sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bank making the payment to Fannie and Freddie as part of a settlement over mortgages sold by Countrywide Financial. Now, Bank of America, remember, bought Countrywide three years ago and Bank of America shares are actually rising this morning on the news.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today will announce a powerful new cancer test it wants to put in the open -- on the market. Now, the blood test is billed as being able to spot a single cancer cell out of a billion healthy cells. J&amp;J is teaming with the scientists who invented the test to make it cheaper and better. The hope is that the blood tests can take the place of more invasive cancer tests.</p><p>And many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day. There was a glitch in the iPhone's alarm clock feature. Users who set their alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't even -- it didn't go off when 2011 arrived. An Apple spokesperson says a fix is in the works and all alarms, they say, will be working properly starting today.</p><p>As for commodities this morning, the oil price has been up above $92 a barrel and is higher than that now as well. $1,423 or thereabouts for gold. Up $2 after being lower earlier.</p><p>Mary Matalin coming up a little bit later this hour with the I-man as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now here at Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: I can't hear you. (INAUDIBLE) here. What's the matter with you?</p><p>It is five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Mary Matalin is coming up.</p><p>Well, I can't hear you. We're trying to -- we're sitting here talking about the guy who does the \"Red Eye\" show on the Fox News Channel. It's on at 3:00 a.m. Gary --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Greg.</p><p>IMUS: Gray --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Gutfield.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfield.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Or Feld. Feld, actually.</p><p>IMUS: Gutfeld.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I said, I had a suspicion that he might be pretty good. My wife says he is. And now here's how he came to my attention, because I was watching the Fox New Year's Eve thing. I was out at the ranch.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I was watching <person><nameText>Megyn Kelly, </nameText></person>who I like, and Bill Hemmer, who I like him, too. And they were just way too happy. I mean that girl was so happy, she was beside herself. And she's about 29 months pregnant. So she's got the baby coming up here.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: And they were just hysterical. Now, I didn't stay with them to see the ball come down, because I don't do that. If you -- if you watch the ball come down --</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: You can't be a bigger loser in life. You can't do it. And if you're there, most of the people in Times Square itself are from somewhere else. They're tourists. They're not -- there's no New Yorkers who I know, and I've been here for a long time, 30 years, who go there and stand there and, you know, let people pee on you while they -- while you're waiting for the ball to come down. I just don't think that happens, do you, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's not going to happen.</p><p>IMUS: All right. So, I was asking about -- so, anyway, he was on, the \"Red Eye\" guy, not the radio red eye guy, the other one, the TV \"Red Eye\" guy. And so we -- I thought, well, let's have him on. Let's have him as a guest. But first we have to find -- I mean I'm not interested in -- we didn't get to be a successful as we are by experimenting, although we did used to do that. But we don't do that anymore. We don't experiment with talent. So, I guess, what's the matter, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: There's something on your shoulder, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: There is?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, on your --</p><p>MCSHANE: Your coming apart.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you know, hey, Connell --</p><p>MCCORD: Uh-oh.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, Trevor. You know what happened?</p><p>MCGUIRK: (INAUDIBLE). Damn it, someone!</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Easy mistake.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Can you hear us now, chief? He can't hear us.</p><p>IMUS: No, I can't hear you, you little bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, thanks for telling us.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Connell, this thing -- I mean, Trevor, this thing came loose again.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'll fix it for you.</p><p>IMUS: Well, actually, he can fix it.</p><p>All right, time for a little news and here with that --</p><p>MCSHANE: Is Trevor.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter?</p><p>MCCORD: Just the ongoing saga of the ear monitors.</p><p>IMUS: These are my $1,500 ear monitors.</p><p>MCCORD: There's something every freakin' 15 minutes.</p><p>IMUS: That won't stay together.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But what about Greg Gutfeld?</p><p>IMUS: Well, we're going to watch him -- I'm going to watch his show tonight --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: And if he's any good, we'll have him on. I bet he must be, wouldn't you think? Have you ever seen it, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. I have not really seen the show. It's on, as you said, 3:00 in the morning, no.</p><p>IMUS: My wife says he's good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And Opie, Anthony -- Anthony's on a lot, right?</p><p>BARTLETT: Supposedly.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we know Anthony's funny. I'll listen (ph).</p><p>Here's Chuck with the news.</p><p>MCCORD: The president says he is honored to have signed the bill to provide the aid to survivors of the 9/11 attacks and first responders who became ill working at Ground Zero. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, named after a police officer who died of a respiratory disease that he contracted during the 9/11 operations, his father now says he is happy others will finally be getting the help they need.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an important not only because my son was sick for four years, you know, and we watched him die and we couldn't get no help for him. Now -- there was -- no one would recognize that he was sick from the World Trade Center.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: The bill provides $4.2 billion in help to sick workers and several hundred people who live near the burning pile, the toxicity at the World Trade Center ruins. The president signing the measure in private as his Hawaiian vacation neared its end.</p><p>IMUS: Bill Carter, a journalist from \"The New York Times,\" who's a nice guy, by the way. Writes all these books about the late night talk show wars that nobody cares about and no one reads. And -- but they're good. I guess I read them. (INAUDIBLE). He and some other clown wrote an article over the past couple of weeks about Jon Stewart being perhaps the new Edward R. Murrow --</p><p>MCCORD: Crusader.</p><p>IMUS: Which I suspect even Mr. Stewart, who I am a fan of --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Found amusing. If not ironic, except every time I use the word ironic, with apologies to Nora Ephron, I always wonder if I'm using it correctly.</p><p>MCCORD: Correct.</p><p>IMUS: And I suspect I'm not. But at any rate, because Stewart was railing about the Republicans who had embraced tragedy of 9/11 as almost their campaign mantra slogan deal, and that they were not entitled to do that anymore because essentially they had refused, which I thought was a disgrace and so did Mr. Stewart. So he talked about it. Then he had some of the responders on. So they were, Mr. Carter and some other dope from \"The Times,\" were crediting Mr. Stewart with providing the impetus for this to be passed, which I thought, well, it might have brought some attention to it, but it certainly didn't spur any Republicans to change their minds about it or to feel some sort of necessity to take action on this and to realize how absolutely disgraceful they were behaving.</p><p>But I saw Shep Smith -- I played this last hour and it's worth playing again. I'll tell you why. Because he does the news on -- he does the news two hours on it on the Fox News Channel. And some of my friends, like Esther Newberg, I love her to death, but is one of these elitist, liberal snobs who, you know, they all think they have all the answers and she's one of these people who refuses to watch Fox News because she thinks they have some sort of agenda and yet, like a moron, she'll watch MSNBC or CNN, who are both dreadful and disgraceful and clearly do have an agenda or, say, CBS or ABC or, for God's sake, NBC.</p><p>So I would call her attention, and I would call to Mr. Carter's attention as well, what Shep Smith had to say about it. And Shep Smith -- I'm going to play it in a second -- referenced Jon Stewart. What I think is significant about it is, is that if you're a Republican like John Thune, I had that dope on, and some of these other people who were dragging their feet and just refusing to vote on this, and Senator Thune had these lame excuses that he gave me. And much to my discredit, I didn't press him on it and should have, but I thought, well, he didn't want to rush into anything and it was too much other money was -- it was a bunch of pork and stuff in it and even that was kind of Bernie's rap on this. And people like Hannity and some of these other dopes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Those are the facts.</p><p>IMUS: The facts are nothing. The point is -- the facts are stupid. The point is, it should have been passed and, of course, now it was passed and they did take out about $3 billion of pork.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: My point, God, if I could make the point, is that when Shep Smith talked about it, that got the attention of all of the Republicans and everyone else, because they're thinking, if Shep Smith, with that enormous audience that he has and that Fox News has, if he's against this, then as Walter Cronkite famously said or Lyndon Johnson said about Walter Cronkite during the Vietnam War, if we've lost him, we've lost the country. Here's Shep Smith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEP SMITH, FOX NEWS: Last night on Jon Stewart, it was Jon Stewart's last (INAUDIBLE) of the week and, OK, we watch it. Whatever. And he's just flat on, absolutely right. And it's worth saying, who's going to hold these people's feet to the fire when we -- you know, we're able to put a 52 story building down there so far at Ground Zero. We're able to pay for tax cuts for billionaires who don't need them and it's not going to stimulate the economy, but we can't give health care to Ground Zero first responders who ran right into the fire, went down there to save people. The people knew what this city was like that day. People were walking over bridges. They were covered in ash. They were running for their lives. They were crying. Their family members were dead. And these people ran to Ground Zero to stave people's lives. And we're not going to even give them medicine for the illnesses that they got down there. It's disgusting. It's a national disgrace. It's a shame. And everybody who voted against it should have to stand up and account for himself or herself. Is anybody going to hold them accountable?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you just did.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I'm not really in a position to do that. I mean I think I just kind of went out there and said what the truth is and I feel like -- I feel like at some point we're going to have to do something for these people. There was no warning label on Ground Zero on 9/11 \"these substances will kill you.\" And even if there had been, they'd have gone anyway. They just need a little bit of help. It wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. We spend a lot more money giving Warren Buffett his income tax refunds than we do doing anything for those people, don't we?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: So that's Shep Smith, Fox News. So the next time one of you want to tell me about Fox News, I'm going to tell you about Shep Smith. That's what I'm talking about.</p><p>Now, I didn't see Diane Sawyer and I didn't see that coward Brian Williams or that little rodent over there. Well, we don't need to get into name calling, Don.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, why are we?</p><p>IMUS: Or the very lovely Katie Couric --</p><p>MCCORD: Better.</p><p>IMUS: Or the -- well, not so courageous, that's a better way to put it, Brian Williams. Did you ever -- did -- what -- did they say anything about it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, of course not. Were they railing about it at MSNBC? Well, of course not. So that's what I'm talking about. So if you're the John Thunes of the world and you turn that on -- it's on all the time here -- if you see Shep Smith calling you out --</p><p>MCCORD: Then, wait a minute.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, Chris Wallace in there sucking his thumb, thinking, oh, I hope I don't get in trouble.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, he brought it up on the Sunday show.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, quarter after the hour. Time for a little sports now.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And the (INAUDIBLE) Democrats controlled Congress for two years, with the Democratic president, and they waited till the lame duck session to try to pass this (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>IMUS: Save all that for next time you're on Hannity.</p><p>It's 16 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I'll get an e-mail from Hannity.</p><p>Did we do your business report yet, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: Not yet, I don't think.</p><p>IMUS: No, OK, we can do it in a minute. Don't worry about it.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK, I'm not.</p><p>IMUS: Time for a little sports now and here with that is Warner Wolf.</p><p>Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Well, they completed the playoff picture last night. The lonely Seattle Seahawks finishing 7-9, beat the Rams 16-6. They win the NFC West. Change the rule, man. Forget winning the division, you can't have a losing record. You're out. Replaced by the non-playoff team with the best record. The Giants, by the way, will bring back Tom Coughlin.</p><p>Packers win their final wild card spot, beating the Bears 10-3.. That eliminated the Giants. The Colts win the AFC South, beat the Titans 23-20. Adam Vinatieri's 43 yard field goal, last play of the game. Although the Colts didn't know it, because they didn't show the score on the scoreboard. They had actually won it minutes earlier when the Jags lost. The Steelers win the AFC North. The Falcons win the NFC South.</p><p>And the NBA last night, in Los Angeles, before a rare booing crowd, they booed the Lakers at the Staples Center. The Lakers lost to the Grizzlies by 19 points, 104-85. And after the game, Phil Jackson blamed it on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL JACKSON, LOS ANGELES LAKERS COACH: As a result, you know, early in the third quarter on some stupid plays, and, you know, Kobe has to screw up the, you know, game and start energizing the team by going one-on-one. That takes the rest of the guys out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Wow, Kobe screwing up the game.</p><p>IMUS: So Kobe was going one-on-one with some other member of the other team, obviously, duh, right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, one of the members of -- one of the audience members.</p><p>IMUS: Well, speaking of the audience, here's what's wrong with the Lakers.</p><p>WOLF: What is it?</p><p>IMUS: It's one thing if Jack Nicholson wants to have floor seats -- I mean, I think he deserves those. He's earned them, don't you think?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But not Larry David. Not some sit -- not some sitcom dope.</p><p>MCCORD: What's he done?</p><p>IMUS: Well, should be sitting there -- I mean you just can't.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, work it --</p><p>IMUS: And yet I watched the game on Christmas Day, the brain did -- of course I'm furiously e-mailing Breen my comments as he's trying to do the game, which I'm sure -- and he sometimes answers them, by the way.</p><p>WOLF: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: But Larry David? How possibly could Larry David -- who gave Larry David a floor seat? That's a disgrace.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He only created \"Seinfeld.\" Come on.</p><p>IMUS: What does \"Seinfeld\" have do with it. Seinfeld must have something to do with it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, a little bit. Larry David's a genius?</p><p>IMUS: Still shouldn't be sitting on -- he's a sitcom dope. He shouldn't be sitting on the floor.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get him out.</p><p>IMUS: He just don't. He may be a genius, but he shouldn't be sitting on the floor. This is the guy you were screaming about he peed on Jesus.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we all stray.</p><p>IMUS: He's -- he is a genius or you -- or he peed on Jesus. You can't pee on Jesus, can you?</p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: And be a genius.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MCCORD: And be a genius, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The two are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>IMUS: It doesn't take a genius to pee on Jesus. It takes 12 -- well, it takes probably a drunk or, you know --</p><p>MCGUIRK: The fact that he got away with it, that was so offensive.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Anyway, 19 after the hour.</p><p>So, were you finished with sports, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: His third sack of the game.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Time for a little business news and here with that is Connell McShane.</p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Just a few quick headlines for you this morning. The market is up again after an 11 percent gain for the Dow in 2010. And the 17 percent rise for the Nasdaq in 2010. The futures are way up this morning. Maybe some optimism about economic data. We had plenty of it this week. Construction spending and manufacturing today. The big retail reports out for the month of December on Thursday and the jobs report for the month of December on Friday.</p><p>So that is there, plus the report, I-man, in \"The New York Times\" that we talked about earlier that Facebook has received an investment of $500 million from Goldman Sachs, according to \"The Times,\" which values Facebook at $50 billion.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the morning here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. And then Dagen McDowell, who will be coming up in a few minutes. She and Connell do their very own show at 11:00 a.m. on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour. Here's one of Mary Matalin's five favorite songs.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let me tell you about Lindamood-Bell. You know what, the lady who runs Lindamood-Bell grew up on a cattle ranch. Old Nancy. Did you know that? I want to share with you the success story from the Lindamood-Bell learning processes. This is from a parent with an eight-year-old son diagnosed with autism. Here's the letter.</p><p>\"David was diagnosed with autism and struggled with socializing, expressive language, critical thinking, comprehension. David started with an assessment at Lindamood-Bell and did an eight week intensive program. The staff at Lindamood-Bell was sensitive to our concerns and needs and gave us constant feedback. David has improved tremendously. Before Lindamood-Bell, his overall comprehension was at the ninth percentile. After his retest at Lindamood-Bell, he was at the 70 percentile.\" That's unbelievable, isn't it? Call them at 800-300-1818 or go online at lindamoodbell.com.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Johnson &amp; Johnson, today, is going to announce a powerful new cancer test that it wants to put on the market.

And their hope is that the blood test can take the place of more invasive cancer tests.</p><p>Stocks starting off the new year with gains. The data out of China is being seen as a positive for the market. It showed manufacturing slip for the first time in five months, but what's that doing is it's easing some inflation concerns. And Europe has been up all morning long. London closed today because of the New Year's holiday. But Paris up 2 percent. Germany up 1.25 percent.</p><p>Here in the U.S., stock index futures indicating a higher open a little over an hour from now on Wall Street with the Dow futures up by 90 points. And a quick look at commodities as well. The oil price is around $92 a barrel all morning. And gold, after being lower, is now up over $1 at $1,422 per ounce.</p><p>All right. The IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right now here at the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Twenty-six after the hour as we continue to get behind here. But it's -- we're getting everything in, so that's more important than anything else, I guess. So, it's time for a little business news again. Here with that, Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>From getting behind to going up, gas prices. The national average for regular unleaded is already $3.07 a gallon. It's going to head back to near $4 a gallon by the spring according to many experts. It should be the second highest year on record in terms of prices. Let's hope it doesn't get back to $4.11 a gallon. That was a record hit in the summer of '08.</p><p>And, by the way, if you're interested in how Shania Twain's life develops with this new husband, who's the ex-husband of the woman who broke up Shania's marriage, she's going to have her own show on the new Oprah Winfrey Network later this year, I believe, called \"Why Not?\" with Shania Twain.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. So you can keep --</p><p>IMUS: Do you have a picture of the husband? Because she's cute.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's cute. Do we have a picture of their wedding?</p><p>IMUS: No, of him?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, well, of him.</p><p>IMUS: You were telling me how hot he was.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's got -- well, he's got curly -- he's got curly hair and it kind of has a little bit of a mullet if memory serves. He's pretty cute. He's better looking than Mutt Lange, I'll put it that way.</p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash deal on that, isn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, brother.</p><p>IMUS: That's a white trash trailer park situation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but you get to watch it for free, though, when you watch it on the TV. That's -- or you can come over to my house, which I don't think you want to do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. How did that go, by the way, over the holidays at your house?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was all right. I got trapped in the house with six adults, three kids and three dogs. And one of the dogs, being a four month old border collie puppy. So that was a good time.</p><p>IMUS: Who were the adults?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mama, daddy, brother, his wife, Jonas and me. If you could call us all adults.</p><p>IMUS: How is your brother's wife? How do you get along with her?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I adore her.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you do?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. We get along good.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, that's too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Well, we'd just like a little friction and stuff going on. So there wasn't any animosity that bubbled to the surface there or any long held resentments or anything?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I wasn't happy with -- no, I wasn't happy with my Christmas gifts from Jonas. But other than that.</p><p>IMUS: What did he get you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Underwear that he bought -- I know he bought on sale because I saw it on sale on the Internet. And a computer, a laptop, which is just business. I didn't want something business related. And I wanted underwear that fit that was nicer than what he gave me. So, I was mad. At least I didn't get those pajama jeans. I mean I can look on the bright side.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he didn't get you like them big ole granny drawers, did he?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some were, yes, large in size. Some, too small. There was no happy medium.</p><p>IMUS: He didn't' get --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was no happy medium. They were either to small and uncomfortable or they were too big and loose.</p><p>IMUS: So he didn't go the Victoria's Secret thong deal?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, he went on the Internet to one of these private sales sites and bought drawers on sale.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he got you some -- he got you some of those Hanes -- big old -- them Hanes big beefy drawers.</p><p>MCCORD: Off of eBay.</p><p>IMUS: All right, time for a Bernard McGuirk briefing, a \"Bernie Briefing,\" sponsored by -- these big old beefy drawers.</p><p>MCCORD: That ain't right.</p><p>IMUS: Sponsored by P.C. Richard &amp; Son. A hundred and one years they've got it going on. Still going on.</p><p>What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, chief, on the \"New Year's Rocking Eve\" fright night, the TV shows, I confess I was one of the losers who was up at midnight watching. And I was watching Dick Clark --</p><p>IMUS: No, don't do this.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And -- well, no, no, this is -- this is a big story. There are competing, differing opinions as to whether or not Dick Clark should still be out there. Some people say it's an inspiration, but --</p><p>IMUS: No, no. It's too humiliating for him. Whoever is around him shouldn't let him do this. It's terrible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DICK CLARK, BROADCASTER: But don't you go anywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Where did that come from?</p><p>IMUS: I didn't hear the sound. There's no point in playing it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We have audio here. Lou will play it.</p><p>Here, Lou. Go ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARK: Thank you, Ryan, very much. Now, take a look at all the people up on Broadway. I don't know how people pull off this party year after year, but they do a whale of a job. And tonight it will be bigger and better than ever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Again, some people say that's inspiring, and some people say it's out of place. But in any case, he won the night far and away. He was the most watched show that night of all the broadcast and cable New Year's Eve shows. And God bless poor old Dick Clark.</p><p>IMUS: You bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: What?</p><p>IMUS: You evil bastard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why?</p><p>IMUS: You just can't --</p><p>MCCORD: Well, he shouldn't be going on.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I didn't put him on ABC.</p><p>IMUS: No, no.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I think he should be on. I think he is an inspiration.</p><p>IMUS: Put him on Fox. No. No.</p><p>MCCORD: He was just presenting the controversy.</p><p>IMUS: You put him on ABC. You can't be. You can't do that. It's horrible.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I happen to disagree. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a nice thing. And again, it inspires people who have been ill.</p><p>My dad had a stroke, he came back from it. It makes people say, yes, I can do it.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. Here he is on -- who is that Ryan Seacrest? Do you have any sound on that, Big Foot.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We have a little -- we have sound. Lou and I have some sound from Ryan Seacrest just before --</p><p>IMUS: Well, there's Dick and -- Big Foot, we can't hear any sound on this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe he doesn't want to.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN SEACREST: Sorry. Sorry, not my fault.</p><p>CLARK: Happy New Year.</p><p>SEACREST: Happy New Year. Great job.</p><p>CLARK: Thank you, Ryan. Thank you.</p><p>SEACREST: Thank you so much.</p><p>Dick Clark, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>Well, we are inside, and it's even warmer in here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a nice thing. The man's been through hell and back. Way to kick off the new year.</p><p>Charles, push him. Is he all right?</p><p>MCCORD: He's all right, but he's --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Looking to the future.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: You son of a bitch!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Tom goes for the easy joke.</p><p>IMUS: Call that funny, Charles?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good. Now everybody is --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Everybody is waiting to see who is going to say it.</p><p>IMUS: Tom.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, Tom, have you got that clip? Lou?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll he come up here and I'll find you. Are you coming down here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just got to e-mail from Neil Cavuto.</p><p>IMUS: That's not funny.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was down at the ranch last we week.</p><p>MCCORD: This is not -- stop.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not funny. It's not funny, no.</p><p>MCCORD: This is not good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not funny, Bernard. It's not.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Look, God bless Dick Clark, is all I'm saying.</p><p>MCCORD: There is an is inspirational story.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. That Ryan Seacrest, too.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCCORD: You've got to stop.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God.</p><p>MCGUIRK: \"Blonde on Blonde\" is coming up tomorrow.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: That's just horrible. God.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Imus at night -- be there.</p><p>IMUS: Why do they do that? That's horrible.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are they wheeling him out there?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, it's his show. He's as lucid as they come. He just can't speak properly. So why not?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the way he's going to go out though.</p><p>MCGUIRK: So what? That's his choice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it's not.</p><p>IMUS: That's not right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It was a ratings winner for the night.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't think it had much to do --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go see how he is?</p><p>IMUS: Do you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Ryan Seacrest. You had a bunch of great performers. Kesha was there.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Ryan Seacrest, if you get down and you -- I mean, I like him, but if you get down and you scrape the bottom of the show biz barrel, that's where you find Ryan Seacrest. I mean, he's on the E! Channel, for God's sake.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's \"American Idol.\" He's at the top of his game, that guys.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, whatever. He's at the bottom of the barrel. He may be at the top of the game, but --</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: And when Congress gets back to work on Wednesday, California Congressman Darrell Issa getting a big promotion. He'll become the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which basically means he'll be the one or heading up the committee that oversees the government.</p><p>And appearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Issa telling Chris Wallace he's going to target government spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: We have about $1.7 trillion worth of regulatory costs already in the government. If the president wants to throw another $300 or $400 billion, what he's doing is taking it right out of businesses, right out of employment, right out of competitiveness. We need to make sure we can compete.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Issa has indicated he's going to call a lot of hearings as committee chairman on topics including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also Medicare.</p><p>Checking in on the markets here this morning for you, up all morning long. And we are indicated higher on the futures by 85 points now on Dow futures. It looks like a strong start to the new year coming on Wall Street in just a little while.</p><p>It's the IMUS IN THE MORNING program that continues right now with a check of the forecast.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>IMUS: Twenty minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country, and on the Fox Business Network all over the world. Three new radio affiliates today -- WAUB, 1590, way up there on the right-hand side of the dial where the dogs can listen, and at 94.1 FM here in Auburn, New York.</p><p>MCCORD: But you can't.</p><p>IMUS: On WGBA, 1240 on the dial there in Geneva, New York, Finger Lakes News Radio. And KWKC, 1340 AM, in Abilene, Texas, Talk Radio 1340.</p><p>Tomorrow, on this program, Tom Friedman. Wednesday, \"Blonde on Blonde.\"</p><p>Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, our old friend, former assistant to the president, vice president, a bunch of other stuff, Mary Matlin.</p><p>Good morning, Ms. Matalin.</p><p>MARY MATALIN, FMR. ASSISTANT TO VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY: Here, kitty kitty. Hey. Good morning. Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Are you calling the cat?</p><p>MATALIN: Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty kitty. She was trapped outside and was about to unleash the dogs of my hell, my mini dachshund. I said, \"Kitty.\"</p><p>It irritates I-Man. He doesn't want to hear you.</p><p>IMUS: I like cats and dogs. What's your cat's name?</p><p>MATALIN: Witchy. She has one green eye and one blue eye.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you out of breath?</p><p>MATALIN: Because I had to move the chair, open the shades, and open the window from the bottom up, while I was holding the phone in my ear. And I'm old now.</p><p>IMUS: Did you -- what did you do New Year's Eve?</p><p>MATALIN: Made black eyed peas and cabbage and listened to WWOZ and had a glass of wine by myself.</p><p>IMUS: Where was James?</p><p>MATALIN: Was it after 9:00? If it's after 9:00, he's in bed.</p><p>IMUS: So did you stay up and watch the ball come down?</p><p>MATALIN: I listened to WWOZ, which is the best jazz in the world -- Irvin Mayfield, jazz play club on Bourbon Street live.</p><p>IMUS: Radio?</p><p>MATALIN: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you didn't make that clear.</p><p>MATALIN: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I should know everybody doesn't know WWOZ. But if you don't, you can get it live streaming. It's the best jazz.</p><p>IMUS: Because Bernie just played a cut of Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve in which Mr. Clark was on. And, of course, he's had a stroke some years ago.</p><p>MATALIN: Yes, I saw it on, and I have to take Bernie's side as I do on most things on this. I thought it was an inspiration.</p><p>IMUS: You thought it was an inspiration?</p><p>MATALIN: I guess you don't.</p><p>IMUS: Well, an inspiration to who?</p><p>MATALIN: Just what Bernie said. If you've been -- if you've come back from something that -- a disease that people -- or suffered from something that would normally render you hidden away for whatever reason, and you can come back, that's an inspiration to others who are similarly afflicted. Heart disease or cancer or anything, you can talk about it and show people that everything is workable, and life is worth living.</p><p>IMUS: Does she have a point, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, and a point that it need not be in all cases the end and --</p><p>MATALIN: Or it can be a different reality.</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly. And Mr. Clark is a textbook example of that.</p><p>IMUS: Well, but my problem with it is --</p><p>MCCORD: What?</p><p>IMUS: -- is that whenever it gets played on this program, and the reason that it's intended to be a source of amusement, that's the problem.</p><p>MATALIN: So it's not -- so, as always, it's always about you. This is about what, is that you're saying? You didn't like it?</p><p>IMUS: Well, guess what? It's 2011. Suddenly, it's not going to be about me this year. Well, of course.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATALIN: This is your new New Year's resolution?</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but I don't know --</p><p>MCCORD: It could be about him a few years down the road.</p><p>IMUS: I just don't -- I don't know. I feel bad for the guy and I don't think it's funny. I mean, you can make it funny. They did make it funny, Bernie and Lou, of course, and Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: You made it funny.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MATALIN: You made it funny. Bernie made it about --</p><p>IMUS: Then they made it about me, a window to the future.</p><p>MATALIN: You invited it. You invited it by being so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I don't invite the ridicule that I constantly get on this program.</p><p>MATALIN: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p>MATALIN: OK.</p><p>IMUS: So the Bush tax cuts, I guess, have been extended. What does that mean?</p><p>MATALIN: That means these rich bastards who don't need them, you know, are now going to get them.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why do you think the president did it?</p><p>MATALIN: Because he's -- he just wanted to screw his own guys.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MATALIN: No. None of the above.</p><p>IMUS: Well what then?</p><p>MATALIN: It's -- I think we -- he did it because he didn't want to be blamed for not doing it. And Larry Summers and everybody else came out and said that reality, which will give us a double-dip recession if taxes are affected in a recession.</p><p>IMUS: So you think it's going to have an impact on the economy?</p><p>MATALIN: I think the opposite would have had a severe impact, a better impact --</p><p>IMUS: That's not what I asked you.</p><p>MATALIN: Well, these aren't yes or no questions.</p><p>IMUS: Well, answer it as best as you can, as you're capable of.</p><p>MATALIN: I'm answering it.</p><p>IMUS: By opening the window and choking your cat.</p><p>MATALIN: One of the cats, the one that still has a tail.</p><p>A better package would have been to have no spending increases and leave the tax structure as it was, and leave the estate tax where it was so people don't make decisions upon -- about their final days based on their tax situation, which I think is immoral. That would have been the better package, but that's not what happened because politics --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Well, the rap we were hearing, Mary Matalin, is that if we gave the tax cuts to all these rich bastards and these other folks, that that would all -- that they would then invest in the economy and hire more people and all that sort of thing.</p><p>So, my question is, do you think that's going to happen?</p><p>MATALIN: No, that's the rap that -- that's -- the case for tax cuts as a stimulative economic policy do not --</p><p>IMUS: I like that phrase.</p><p>MATALIN: -- go to those tax cuts. That was maintaining a tax rate, the changing of which would have exacerbated recessionary problems.</p><p>Stimulative taxes -- not all tax cuts are created equal -- would have been further reductions of the top rates, a reduction in the corporate tax rate, eradication of corporate taxes loopholes and such, and tax reform, which the president's talking about. That's stimulative tax policy, not just keeping the same rates. So that's one of their canards.</p><p>And what would be most stimulative now is to continue to reduce or make some effort to stop spending and roll back the debt, starting with health care. So that will be the plan, and I hope they get some of it done.</p><p>IMUS: And your scummy Republican friends were shamed into caving in on the 9/11 Responders Bill.</p><p>MATALIN: In response to scummy liberals, who --</p><p>IMUS: And inspired quite a bit by Shep Smith (ph).</p><p>MATALIN: -- let it sit there for years and did nothing about it, and wait until it's Christmas Eve and lard it up. Yes, it should have been passed. It should have been passed two years earlier. There shouldn't have been anybody who had any problem getting any health care at any time from 9/11 on.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, that's a very good point.</p><p>Hey, how are things in New Orleans? You live there now, right?</p><p>MATALIN: We're going on year three.</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>MATALIN: This is our third year here. It's wonderful.</p><p>IMUS: Who is the new mayor there?</p><p>MATALIN: He's spectacular.</p><p>IMUS: Who is it -- huh?</p><p>MATALIN: He's going to be up in New York. He comes a lot. He's got a new police chief.</p><p>IMUS: What is his name?</p><p>Oh, I'm sorry. Mitch Landrieu, Mayor Mitch.</p><p>IMUS: Has he been indicted yet?</p><p>MATALIN: We used to -- half the state was under water and other half was under indictment. But we're not like that now. We're all cleaned up now.</p><p>IMUS: Happy New Year to you, the kids, him.</p><p>MATALIN: And Happy New Year. You'll never be -- you'll always be you, Imus. You'll just always be you.</p><p>IMUS: Well, let's hope so. Thank you.</p><p>MATALIN: Happy New Year.</p><p>IMUS: Mary Matalin.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Here is the \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Many iPhone users getting some unwanted extra sleep on New Year's Day. There was a glitch in the phone's alarm clock feature. Users who set their alarm for a single wakeup finding it didn't go off when 2011 arrived.</p><p>An Apple spokesperson says the fix is in the works and all alarms will work properly starting today. But users in Europe and Asia saying the problem has not yet been fixed.</p><p>Vizio, maker of inexpensive flat-TV screens, is looking to expand. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports the company wants to branch out into cell phones and tablet computers, and those two products, the Via Phone and the Via Tablet, will be introduced this summer. The announcement comes just days ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show taking place this week in Las Vegas.</p><p>And \"Little Fockers\" holding on to the top spot at the weekend box office. That movie bringing in just over $26 million this past weekend, so it's total now $103 million.</p><p>With no other movies -- no new movies being released over the New Year's weekend, the rest of the lineup looks similar to last week. The number two and three movies are still \"True Grit\" and \"TRON Legacy.\"</p><p>As for the futures this morning, they have been higher all morning long, indicating the Wall Street open will be to the upside, as Dow futures are up by 83 points.</p><p>And IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, \"The Power to Prosper.\"</p><p>IMUS: Coming up on five minutes to the hour. This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program sponsored by State Bank. Put your business in a better state. Visit statebankofli.com.</p><p>Well, coming up next hour, Jeff Greenfield. We'll talk to him, CBS News. And then Stuart Varney.</p><p>Is Stuart here today, Connell? Do you know?</p><p>MCSHANE: I think he would be, yes. Back to full strength.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, he is. He's here.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he is?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's unusual, because ordinarily he would stretch one of these New Year's deals into an extra week's vacation, but apparently he's not done that.</p><p>Gangsta Mickey is here, and so is Charles Rangel, neither of whom have been on this morning, but they will get on coming up.</p><p>It's five minutes now until the hour.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you looking at me -- with your mouth hanging open like a $2 suitcase?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Huh?</p><p>IMUS: Made you look -- huh? What's the matter?</p><p>POWELL: No, it's just another day at the home. That's what it is. Just dropping my fork.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, that's not good.</p><p>Hi, dude.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>MCCORD: When you start dropping your utensils.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no. I wasn't eating, you idiot.</p><p>POWELL: Well, you freaked out about it though. It's like, \"Oh, my fork.\"</p><p>IMUS: I dropped it because I have this tea, and they have hunks of lemon in it. And I eat the lemon.</p><p>POWELL: Sucking on a lemon.</p><p>MCCORD: Eat the lemon, baby.</p><p>IMUS: That's what I had for breakfast.</p><p>MCCORD: Eat the worm.</p><p>POWELL: So that's what's putting on all those pounds, those lemons and the condiment sandwiches?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: You're going to have to cut out those lemon wedges. Those lemon wedges are killing you, I-Dude.</p><p>IMUS: Ballooned up to 153 pounds.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, less tomato in your sandwich. Maybe just one slice of onion.</p><p>IMUS: I'm not happy with either one of you bastards. Got to get some new blood in here.</p><p>BARTLETT: Why don't you do that?</p><p>IMUS: Huh?</p><p>BARTLETT: Why don't you do that? And let me know how that works out for you.</p><p>IMUS: Get old Cara (ph) to call, see what she is he' doing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes, she'll commute back and forth from L.A.</p><p>IMUS: Did you tell me her new boyfriend died?</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: This is a boyfriend or girlfriend?</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes, it's -- I don't know if -- obviously not the one she's dating now.</p><p>(REPEAT PACKAGE)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MFB-2011010301cb220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MFB2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:51VT-SW41-JBKP-N13Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"22376\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved. </copyright><publicationName>MONEY FOR BREAKFAST</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>January 3, 2011 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002E8D</classCode><className>EXPEDIA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, November 20th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Global markets are in sell-off mode and we are at the lows of the morning right now. Looks like it's going to be a 300-point sell-off right out of the gate this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow Industrials right now down 288 points. Better than one percent lower on the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500. The NASDAQ down 115 points right now. That's 1-3/4 percent lower extending a sharp decline of yesterday. Take a look at the damage yesterday with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 were both down roughly 1-1/2 percent apiece but the real weakness was technology and the NASDAQ slid three percent on the session 220 points lower yesterday.</p><p>This morning is no different, we're looking at declines across the board and some of the biggest names in the sector and the premarket, Facebook down two percent, Amazon down almost three percent as is Apple. Netflix down better than three percent. Alphabet, parent of Google down almost two percent down across the board on tech. Global markets are following the U.S. lower.</p><p>European Indices are down across the board, the FT-100 down a half of a percent, 34 points lower. The CAC Quarante in Paris down better than one percent. And the DAX Index in Germany down 1-1/4 percent right now. In Asia overnight, declines across the board as well as you can see there. Meanwhile, from the tech wreck to the retail route, Target, Lowe's and Kohl's all under pressure this morning on earnings.</p><p>Target and Lowe's same-store sales missed expectations. Kohl's stock is down almost 10 percent right now. 9-1/2 percent down on Kohl's, reporting better-than-expected results and raising guidance. The people are not happy with the same-store situations. Target down 9-1/3 percent as you can see there. Lower's down six percent, down across the board. Meanwhile, the future of the Renault-Nissan Alliance hangs in the balance this morning.</p><p>Leaders from France to Japan, looking to take action following the shocking news of the arrest of Carlos Ghosn. We have the very latest this morning. The ultimate gift guide. Courtesy of Gwyneth Paltrow. You won't believe some of the items on goops list from marble dumbbells to an entire Spanish village. Yes. We've got it for you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes media chairman and former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell. Good to see you this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Good to be here. Man, that retail, those same store sales numbers are weaker than expected, those retails are down worse than techs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And meanwhile, we just had on the former CEO Toys\"R\"Us who said it's going to be a terrific black Friday, terrific fourth quarter. So what are missing here?</p><p>BELL: Well, I think that -- well, some of these same-store sales numbers came in just slightly below expectations but I think what the problem is we look out to the fourth, last year was a blockbuster fourth quarter. So the question is, are we going to be able to beat those exceptional numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BELL: The CEOs of these companies feel very good about it but then also I think people worried about inventory and most importantly, Steve, you pointed this out earlier, we're getting to 2019, tariffs that they got from 10 percent to 25 percent if they go on the additional 267 billion that's left out there, then we're going to have major problems at retailer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Jerry Storch made the -- made the comment that it's really margins under pressure for these companies.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. If you have to raise prices, that's great but the margin pressure comes if you have tariffs slapped on your goods that you're importing from China, and then you can't raise the prices that puts pressure on your with margins and then also that -- you have company -- again, it's not just about consumer prices and the - - oh your little can of soup isn't going up that much.</p><p>It's about essentially disrupting business and introducing uncertainty where there wasn't any, to a vast array of businesses in this country.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Yes. Huge complicated supply chains are going to be disrupted. These tariffs are going to hit profit margins saying, yes, will consumers pay more, will consumers don't like to pay more? That's going to impact them next year. And the longer they allow this trade thing to drag out the worse it's going to be. And the markets in unmerciful mood, any slight thing and they will smash you, not good sign.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We got all of that coming up this morning. Joining the conversation this hour, former White House Secretary Sean Spicer is here. The founder and partner of Activate, Michael Wolf is going to walk us through what's going on with technology and media. And the host of Varney &amp; Varney, Stuart Varney weighs in as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big hour coming up right here.</p><p>We kick it off right here with the tech wreck taking a toll on Wall Street. Lauren Simonetti is on the floor of the New York Stock exchange with that and the retail rout this morning. And Lauren, technology took the market down sharply yesterday. Looks like it's doing the same this morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Basically since Apple reported their latest earnings, investors are saying what is going on with Apple and we keep getting new news every day. The news today is Goldman Sachs came out and they cut their price target on the stock to $182 from $209. Why is that important? Well, that would be bear market territory. Apple is near bear market territory right now but down in the premarket, it probably gets there by the end of the day.</p><p>Two things they noted, Goldman says there is weakness in demand for Apple products in China, and the 10R is not being well-received thus far. Let's talk about retail getting killed today and a lot of the stores that are reporting here saying, why are they getting killed? Let's talk about Kohl's n general. Good news it's being sold. They raised their forecast, double beat but the stock is down and down in a big way.</p><p>Same-store sales a little bit light, investors also might have wanted more from that increase, forecast for earnings on the year. Target, the CEO comes out and says they are better position for this holiday than ever before. They grew their e-commerce sales 49 percent but with that fulfilling those orders, their margins are getting squeezed, this stock is getting hit hard and Lowe's is down in a big way as well. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren. Thank you so much. We'll be watching what all this means for the open which we are looking at now, could be a 300- point selloff in the Dow Industrials at the opening of trading in an hour and half. Meanwhile, new rules at the White House. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders releasing new mandates that news conferences which state this.</p><p>Journalists will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to others. A follow-up question may be permitted at the discretion of the President. Failure to respect these rules may result in suspension or cancellation of a journalist's hard pass. This outline of course coming after officials dropped the effort to suspend CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass.</p><p>Joining us right now is former White House Press Secretary under President Trump, America First action PAC, senior advisor and author of the briefing book, Sean Spicer. Sean, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Good morning. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: New rules after the whole Acosta mess, a couple of weeks ago. What's your reaction to all of this?</p><p>SPICER: Well, I think it's sad and unfortunate that it's come to this. You have to mandate professional behavior and decorum because a few bad apples are trying to make it about themselves and make a show of what is supposed to be an opportunity for journalists to ask the President questions. As you saw at that press conferences up 100 plus members of the media from all sorts of backgrounds and publications that are seeking to ask the President of the United States a question.</p><p>And yet one journalist in particular wants to monopolize it for himself and make it into the Acosta show. So I think in the past, there have been sort of unwritten rules in terms of how you behave respect the office of the President. This one individual is clearly blown through them now we have come to the point we've got to treat them looks like children rules and now we've come to the point where we've got to treat them like children.</p><p>And put down rules and regulations so that people can actually behave and it's not just about the President, right? I think mostly comes out to treating other journalists with the respect that they deserve.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't think there's anything negative to have certain rules for decorum when you're speaking to the office of the President. I mean, I don't -- what do you guys think? I mean, I want to stand with journalist but at the same time I think there should be a respect for office of the President.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But if the White House had done this first Sean and just said, here are the rules of conduct that we're going to lay out rather than just pulling the guy's hard card. Again, you kind of -- you end up losing, you know, losing that initial battle. This happens over and over again where it seems like that somebody at the White House is behaving rationally and not stepping back in taking a breath which quite frankly the President just done when Jim Acosta was trying to grab that mic or keep the microphone from that young woman.</p><p>If he just stepped back and folded his arms and said nothing and said, I'm ending this press conference in five minutes unless Jim Acosta sits down, again, he would have won and it wouldn't have be a win for Jim Acosta.</p><p>SPICER: Yes. I think that's partially right and -- but I --and as I said at the outset, I think it's unfortunate that it's come to this because you won't -- you've been able to exist all along without having to go this route. I think that what it's going to mean is -- you know, I agree with Dagen in the sense that I don't know why he called him in the first place. But if you don't call on him then they -- then they do the antics as well and they start going, I haven't been called on any yells and he jumps up and down and disrupts them in the first place.</p><p>So the court basically said that the CNN in this case, Jim Acosta had a Fifth Amendment right to due process. So the White House is basically complying with the court order and saying great, then we will have a process, put in place, we will notify them what the -- what the rules are, and what the procedures will be if you violate them.</p><p>But this is a result of a court order that said that in this particular case, that there was not necessarily a first amendment right to enter the White House but that there was a Fifth Amendment due process rule to ensure that there was a way to know that what they violated and that there were rules so that they could follow in the first place.</p><p>FORBES: That gets to the whole thing, Sean, and that is -- there's no law that says the White House has to have these press conferences, they can set the rules any rules they want. And so the court I think was stretching things. The White House can could whatever it wants on the - on the -- on press availability with the press.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And not only that but CNN has been criticizing and poking President Trump for the last two years. And then he fights back and then it's like this big thing fighting back.</p><p>BELL: Well, I think this makes it just these press conferences much more orderly. This is how corporate earnings calls go for a lot of these bigger companies you get one question and you move to the next analyst.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a great point.</p><p>BELL: What's so wrong with that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes.</p><p>SPICER: Yes, I mean -- and look, and here is the thing, it's just -- I think it's sad and unfortunate all around because I think Steve is right, you don't have to have a press conference, you don't have to call on reporters, you don't have to do a lot of things but I think it's good for democracy that the President of the United States from time to time gets up and as he does so often engages with these members of the press so that they can ask their questions. I think it's good for --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I don't know about that. I mean -- I mean, we are living in America where we have free speech and we are, you know, I mean they have to answer reporter's questions. I'm not saying that. I mean, when you say they don't have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SPICER: No, no, no. What I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess so. But you do have to speak to the press. You do have to --</p><p>SPICER: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- you know, answer questions. I'm just saying the way that he put on such a show that it was all about him I think there should be a level of decorum at the White House.</p><p>SPICER: I agree and that's what I'm -- I think that we should engage with the press, it's very healthy for democracy, it's great for the rest of the world to witness us doing this but I think at some point, here is what is think is missing in this discussion and I think it was sad and opportunity was missed by both CNN and the White House Correspondents Association which is this, they should have come forward and say, you know what, we believe in a free press.</p><p>We believe in access, we believe in transparency, but we also acknowledge that there are rules of decorum and professionalism that should stand as the model for our industry of journalists.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SPICER: And they failed to do that and I think that that speaks volumes about the state of journalism today where they defend this kind of inappropriate unprofessional behavior that is not only disrespectful to the President of the United States but disrespectful to other journalists.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's right. And let me -- let me get to this because there's so much dishonesty going on around this story as well. In fact, I saw it, I have to say on CNN this morning and it was incredibly dishonest. Ivanka Trump's lawyer is slamming this report that is alleging that the President's daughter used her private e-mail for government business. Her attorney says, Ivanka followed protocols like those who transitioned into government before her.</p><p>His statement reads in part. To address misinformation being pedaled about Ms. Trump's personal e-mail, she did not create a private server in her house or officer. There was never classified information transmitted. The account was never transferred our housed at Trump organization. No e-mails were ever deleted and the e-mails have been retained in official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.</p><p>So, the bottom line is CNN this morning was going crazy about this hypocrisy that Ivanka Trump used a private e-mails. The issue around Hillary Clinton was the fact that she had a server in her home, so there was nothing stopping her from just deleting anything she wanted because they weren't in White House, Sean. So again, so much dishonesty in the media about this story. What's your reaction, Sean?</p><p>SPICER: Well, exactly, but actually I think the bigger issue was Hillary Clinton was transmitting sensitive and classified information on an unsecured nongovernment e-mail, that was the bigger thing and then she tried to cover it up. And here is the thing that's interesting in that statement. Understand one thing that what is important about the statement that Ivanka's lawyer issued is that if you use a private e-mail which you're right. Maria, many government officials do.</p><p>The question isn't whether you use it, it's whether or not you forward it your government e-mail or preserve it, that's the key so that the government has a record of government transactions occurring. So it's not a question of using it or not, there are rules about using a personal e- mail in government service and it's just ensuring that if you do conduct government business even if it's just routine correspondence then it's actually housed and maintained for the presidential records act and other applicable laws which she did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You can't have a record of it if the server is in your basement. Sean, thank you. Sean Spicer.</p><p>SPICER: You bet, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Back in a moment with Carlos Ghosn and the (INAUDIBLE) shake- up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The fallout is continuing this morning following the arrest of Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. Ghosn -- well, we should add to this now. France's finance minister says that he should no longer lead Renault as the company's CEO and chairman. Renault's board reportedly going to meet today to discuss his replacement. Nissan set to fire him later this week. Ghosn is taken into custody of course in Japan yesterday for allegedly reporting a salary and there are other charges of financial misconduct.</p><p>Now, Ghosn's arrest also raising questions about the Renault-Nissan Alliance which sells more than 10 million vehicles a year. Board of Ghosn's arrest in Japan hitting Asian stocks hard today. Shares of Nissan closed down nearly six percent yesterday.</p><p>Well, California's raging wildfires now responsible for 82 deaths, 700 people are still missing with crews warning some people may never be found due to intensity of the flames. Some relief though could be on a way, four to six of rain is in the forecast but officials are worried about these heavy downpours because could trigger mudslides and already devastated areas.</p><p>Well switching gears, \"MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL,\" pretty cool last night. The Los Angeles Rams and the Kansas City Chiefs honoring the first responders that worked tirelessly to combat the wildfires as well as those were first on the scene at the Borderline Bar &amp; Grill shooting back on November 7th. Now the game itself, the Rams came up on top in the highest scoring \"MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL\" game ever. The final scores, Rams 54, Chiefs 51.</p><p>105 points. That's the third most of any NFL game and it was the first time two teams scored more than 50 in the same game. I think Steve Forbes said, where was the defense. Good point, Steve.</p><p>All right. Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand Goop has released its gifts guide for the holidays. The annual list known for being eco parts, nonsensical and expensive. One item that made the list this year, marble dumbbell. It's 2.2 pounds, it's $100 for one dumbbell. Then there's this, a banana lamp with a golden finish, that's $340 because he doesn't to pay $40.00 for that and if you really want to spend a lot of money, Goop has an entire Spanish village (INAUDIBLE) it can be all yours for just $172,000, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>CASONE: The Ridiculousness starts now for Christmas. Just letting you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No words.</p><p>CASONE: There will be more of these.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She apparently is bringing -- is inking a deal for Goop with Netflix.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So if you are -- if you are already annoyed by Gwyneth Paltrow, prepare to be more annoyed. Some of the garbage that Goop site has sold over the years, it's just --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, a marble dumbbell, I guess that's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Is that supposed to be like a statue, you're not using the dumbbells.</p><p>BELL: It's peeling crystals.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the banana peel with gold.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is me self-editing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't get me that for Christmas.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I -- you know what I will never --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You promise?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I promise to never, ever, ever buy you anything from Goop ever.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back. Screen time concerns. We are breaking down the alarming report about how much time Americans are spending glue to their phones. What do you think? Plus, Activate founder and partner, Michael Wolf weighs in on that and a lot more. Back in a moment right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tech revolution Activate's annual technology and media outlook report forecast the most important trends to watch for 2019 transformation from e-commerce to smart camera, even sports betting. The report finds Americans will spend an additional 11 minutes a day, every day with tech and media by the year 2022 bringing the total time per day spent with technology to 12 hours, 32 minutes.</p><p>Joining me right now is the founder and writer of that report, Activate founder and CEO Michael Wolff. Michael, it's great to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL WOLF, FOUNDER AND CEO, ACTIVATE, INC.: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Before we get to the report, your thoughts on what's happening with this tech wreck. You see companies like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix falling out of bed as people worry about growth, any thoughts?</p><p>WOLF: Well, I mean, first of all, they've lost cumulative over the last six weeks, they've lost about $700 billion in value. And so they drove the market up and they're driving the market down. There is a bunch of things that are concerning people. One of them is privacy and what's happened with Facebook in the last couple -- really in the last couple weeks. The other is, of course, security.</p><p>And there is also concern like how much more growth can they go through. I believe that these companies are going to continue to grow, I think that the biggest Black Friday bargain is Amazon because Amazon is going to continue to grow, they're going to continue to add a lot of revenue. And I don't think that Facebook's privacy problems are really going to have much of an impact on revenue. I mean, they may have --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>WOLF: People may delete the app but with two billion users, advertisers are hooked on Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You would think. That's where the growth is the economy. So, you know, we're seeing an investor reaction but really when you look at the growth what's happening that's what you're writing about. Let's talk about your outlook report, the reports finding that we're spending more and more time on technology. What struck you most about this year's report?</p><p>WOLF: I think there are a couple things. One of them is smart cameras that the average American within three years is going to have 12 smart cameras in their homes. So we're talking about things like the ring camera, others cameras in their kitchens that help really cook, the camera on your car and what's fascinating as much as you might think people are worried about privacy, in reality all of our research shows that the people who were the most worried about privacy are the most likely buy a smart camera or own one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, a smart camera is what? Like that I could pull up the cameras on my phone which a lot of people can do right now with their -- with their alarm systems, but the cameras talk to each other.</p><p>WOLF: The cameras talk to each other and it's not just the camera that talks to you, it's the people within neighborhoods are linking the other -- their cameras and either looking at ring for example from Amazon has an app that allows you to look at what's going on in your neighborhood and report things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>WOLF: And lot of it's going in to the processing using A.I., so you know what's going on but you also can do a bunch of things that are predicting the camera in your kitchen that helps you cook. It's going to be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. So the cameras talking to each other and that's forming an intelligent network.</p><p>WOLF: And intelligent network, so it's not just the cameras in your homes, the cameras in the car, so they go together, to all the cars can talk to each other, they can talk to the cameras on light poles, they can talk to the camera on your phone. We're going to see a lot more intelligence in the network and it's going to enable things like self-driving cars.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about E-commerce? Let's talk there because E-commerce growth dollars will surpass physical growth dollars from three trillion to six trillion you write by 2022.</p><p>WOLF: It -- this year is the inflection point. And so we've got e- commerce got dollars that are growing about 20 percent. We've got physical retail which continues to grow but only around two percent. So we're going to see consumers are going to be buying a lot more and the we've got -- if you look at the biggest companies, it's -- the biggest is Alibaba, it's followed by Amazon, then you go JD.com, and then you've got eBay.</p><p>And all of them are going -- are going to continue to see growth. What's fascinating is they're all marketplaces. They're really not --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's interesting.</p><p>WOLF: They're not actually holding inventory, they're just selling other people's stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's fascinating actually. All right. Online betting is another item that's highlighted in the -- in the report. Online sports betting projected the industry to explode from six billion to 119 billion?</p><p>WOLF: 119 billion, a lot of it is money that was illegally bet, and now it's going to be coming online. This is all the big tech companies are going to benefit as well. So sports leagues and E-sports, and by the way, even the enterprise companies like Oracle. So it's going to end up being within three years about $35 billion in incremental revenue for tech and media. None of which is there -- so it -- today, so it really reflects my optimism for the stocks and the growth in these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So where is the growth? When you look at this whole space of technology and media, what do you think are the most important growth takeaways that we should understand about where this industry is going?</p><p>WOLF: So, I think that we're still going to see a lot of advertising going from traditional media into these -- into these companies. We're -- it certainly going to be E-commerce, it's going to be new devices like the smart camera, still more home speakers and then finally we're going to see a lot of video out there. People -- we -- it's not just Netflix, it's Amazon, it's Hulu, so many of these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even Apple.</p><p>WOLF: Apple.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're starting a streaming service.</p><p>WOLF: They're starting a streaming service. I'm not -- I'm not convinced that Apple is truly going to be a competitor to these others but YouTube with Google is already -- they're already starting YouTube premium and so it -- in each case it's new revenue streams coming in. I mean, betting is going to be enormous and we don't see this today in anybody's P&amp;L.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you see new policies, regulations putting a hamper on any of this? I mean, the growth stories are still in place, and yet these stocks are falling out of bed because I think some people are worried about regulation because these companies keep getting more powerful and more powerful.</p><p>WOLF: It's not clear that regulation can do much, I mean, we -- I recall myself a technology determinist, which is anything people can do with technology, they're going to do, so there can be regulations but these industries are different, they're not like telecom where you're regulating a pipe. So, there's going to be some things I think that Facebook and others are going to identify where advertisements come from because there is this concern about people hacking elections, and it's not just foreign or -- foreign companies or government, it's also within the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: But I'm not convinced there's going to be a lot of regulation, the main thing is going to be the antitrust concerns, and the Time Warner merger ultimately has gone through. And a lot of that isn't just about concerns about monopolies and control, a lot of it is just political.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You doubt -- I mean, I would expect that this is not going to impact the innovation story because the innovation story is very much in place. I mean, the things that you've just brought up in terms of your report show real innovation, whether it's smart cameras, the online betting, or e-commerce.</p><p>WOLF: Artificial intelligence is going to be a massive enabler across most of these industries. I think we're going to see a great deal more functionality, even the phones. We're at a point where the phone has gotten very sophisticated would you could do with the phone is going to continue to grow and continue to play a bigger part on people's lives. And there's a lot of money that's going to flow from other places that hasn't been there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Michael, it's great to see you so.</p><p>WOLF: Great to be here. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Congratulations on another fantastic report. Michael Wolf, a founder of Activate. We'll see you soon, Michael.</p><p>Coming up, technology titans tumbling. We're watching Silicon Valley giants this morning after yesterday's big selloff, and more selling this morning. And then, gift-giving guilt next. Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 20th, your top stories right now 8:35 a.m. on the East Coast. Futures headed lower this morning. Again, we're at the lows of the morning with a decline of almost 300 points right now on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down one percent. We're expecting the S&amp;P to be down one percent as well. And the NASDAQ to be down almost two percent, out of the open, this morning. NASDAQ is down 115 points right now.</p><p>Technologies stocks bringing the markets down, that's what happened yesterday. Google parent, Alphabet joining Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix in bear market territory. Apple, also, very close to bear market territory this morning. The technology giants hit in the premarket. Goldman Sachs cutting its price target on Apple from 209 to 182. I'm not sure how to get to 122 at Goldman, but stock is down 2-2/3 percent on that news this morning.</p><p>European indices down across the board as well. Take a look, we're looking at selling, it's getting worse, down 33 points on the FT-100, half a percent. CAC Quarante in Paris down better than one percent. And the DAX Index in Germany down 1-1/4 percent right now, 135 points lower there. We are looking at Asian markets, also down across the board, closing lower overnight, as you can see, down two percent apiece on Shanghai and Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>Retailers are reporting today, and the reaction from investors is not good. Best Buy out with its better-than-expected numbers that beat both on earnings and revenue compared to estimates. TJX Companies also hitting the tape moments ago, the company behind TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods also missed on earnings expectations. TJX is down three percent, and Ross Stores is down almost eight percent. We are also looking at the rest of the sector, down across the board.</p><p>Meanwhile, we just got a look at the housing market, the October housing starts coming in slightly higher than expected, the building permit number is slightly lower than expected. We've got housing starts looking -- we were expecting a weak showing here, Steve Forbes, but it looks to me like it's a miss in terms of housing starts. What's your take?</p><p>FORBES: It is -- it is a mix, and once interest rates -- once people can get used to four, five percent mortgages and this economy continues to grow, so we get China out of the way, which I think we will, that market will recover. We forget we grew up with four or five percent mortgages. And once that shock is over, I think housing will come back as the economy comes back.</p><p>BELL: I think, though, that the problem is that you have first-time buyers going out there, and we've seen interest rates -- Dagen always point this out -- in the mid-2016, the 10-year was at 1.16, something like that. Now, we're twice that. So, that moved up so quickly makes a difference. And if you're a first-time buyer, you're looking at that change in interest rates, and it makes a difference on your mortgage payments. So, this isn't the weakness in the housing market. It isn't -- this is kind of a reminder, it's nothing new. The existing home sales we get tomorrow have been down year-over-year for seven months in a row now. And that the decline is increasing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In order for like these houses to make sense at higher mortgage rates, you look at a house like in Connecticut, it's for sale for a million and a half dollars. If you go back to mortgage rates that were eight percent which is kind of the longer -- about in the ballpark of the longer- term average over the last several decades, eight percent mortgage takes that home price -- what did it sell for in the early 90s -- less than $400,000. It was like a $300,000 house is now selling for a million and a half dollars, so I think that you have to -- that's the grave worry here is that housing prices, in order to move the inventory that's piling up in a lot of places, they've got to come down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you saying put it in perspective, you're coming off at such a rich time for prices.</p><p>FORBES: But you're also going to see I think a real sharper divergence between red states, blue states, i.e., high-tax states versus low-tax states in this region, tri-state region. Forget it. You're just going to be worse and worse. You go to place like Texas, Florida --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you've lost your deduction in the high-tax states.</p><p>FORBES: You've lost your deduction, and -- but Texas, Florida, I think those places are going to still boom.</p><p>BELL: It's just like the equity market, as interest rates go up, when you have some of these assets that prices have gone up so significantly, so quickly, they have to come back down, you know, when you have interest rates rising.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, what about this market in terms of retail, Lowe's out earlier this morning beating expectations but Futures on the decline. Look at the stock here, Lindsey, down 7-1/3 percent on lows, and you've got all of the majors, even when it was a double beat or earnings better, even a revenue was light, it was same-store sales that really triggered the move, but they're all down across the board.</p><p>BELL: Yes. And same-store sales is a key. When you look at Lowe's, their same-store sales is up I think 1.5 percent. Look at Home Depot in the U.S., 5.4 percent same-store sales. Meanwhile, Home Depot is also down. I think it was down three percent in the last week. Lowe's was down nine percent going into this earnings report, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the NASDAQ is down, what, almost 14 percent from the highs, on the NASDAQ. So, we're seeing, I mean, a serious correction happening as we speak.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So Amazon was in bear market, and it entered a bear market in October. Alphabet, Google's parent company also in a bear market now. And if you're talking about -- but this is -- this is moved way outside of technology. You were talking about how hard these retail stocks have been hit going into this earnings report, Target since November, like early November 11-9 is down -- was already down 10-1/2 percent, and then it's down another almost 10 percent in premarket trading. And this is for -- Kohl's was down 14 percent before today, Lowe's down, 12 percent decline for TJX, Ross Stores down more than 11 percent. This is before the rout that you're seeing this morning, which is astonishing.</p><p>BELL: But this morning, Kohl's -- like Target was still off like 20 percent going into this morning. Kohl's was still up 30 percent year-to- date, going into this morning, so look at that versus the market. And some of these other sectors, and they were looking pretty good and maybe still highfliers, so they're being brought down, too. Even -- so, even the good quality names. And look, Target five percent comp that it's slightly missed. It was a -- that's an amazing number like Gerri said earlier.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: Well, the market tries to anticipate the future, and the future, next year for the consumers is not going to be so good as this tariff thing kicks in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's the issue. And if you're worried about growth going forward and you want to get out of some of these stocks and you want to just allocation shift, you're going to sell what you can sell. So, you've got, what, Apple still up whatever you said, 30 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, where's money been going or what have people been buying, they've been buying treasuries which does seem to suggest people are worried about what the economy and growth looks like moving into next year. So, they were -- the yield was down I think through yesterday, six days in a row, and that's the longest winning streak for the 10-year treasury, I believe in more than two years. Let me go back 2016.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're worried about growth, you're going to sell what you can sell and if you've got gains of 40 percent as some of these retail names or tech names, well, take some profits. Even in the face of good consumer and a good economy now, there's a new Gallup Poll showing the approval of President Trump handling of the economy is up, 53 percent of Americans approve how the President is handling the economy. Those are his best numbers yet, up from a previous high of 51 percent. So, how many people have come on this show, Dagen, and said that things are going really well? You had the head of shop -- international shopping says, it's going to be a blowout fourth-quarter. You had Jerry Stork (ph) saying it's going to be a terrific Black Friday. And yet, people are selling their holdings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I -- but some of what's going on, some of the nervousness, some of the uncertainty among businesses is this self-inflicted wound by this administration. And Steve has talked about that all-year long, and it is a -- trade is the problem.</p><p>FORBES: We're talking during the break about Larry Kudlow that's going on Stuart Varney.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: He says nice things about maybe something is going to happen with China, you'll see this reverse. If something does happen in that meeting in a few days between Xi and Trump --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The G20.</p><p>FORBES: (INAUDIBLE) framework that they might negotiate, sentiment can turn pretty quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.</p><p>BELL: The market needs to see more though than just talk, they need action, they need a game plan on trade. I think that the market is not going to believe like some positive rhetoric out of the G20.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, Stuart Varney is going to weigh in on the technology titans' tumbling this morning. Plus, gift-giving guilt. Check this out, the shocking study on the pressure to overspend during the holidays. That's up next. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We want to give you this market alert because Futures are near the lows of the morning, again, just shy of them, Dow Industrials down 350 points, 1-1/3 percent. The NASDAQ is down 145 points right now, that's better than two percent lower. Yesterday, of course, the NASDAQ was down three percent, the Dow was down two percent.</p><p>Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. And Stu, you say all of the news is bad news for the market.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, it's a perfect storm of bad news, isn't it? I mean, let me list some of the items here. Number one, the Democrats have won the house, so you're not going to get any new stimulus for the economy for next year. Number two, you got a global slowdown, that is going to hurt us. Three, no good news at this point from the trade talks with China, that is a negative. Four, Goldman Sachs says that by the end of next year, we'll be growing at a less than two percent growth rate. That's not good. Number five, most important, you've got a tech sell-off and then some. They did lead the market, now they don't, now they're leading it down. If you add them all up, we could be facing one of those blowout situations, and if we are, maybe that sets up a buying opportunity. But everything points south at this moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it seems like, at some point, it's going to be a big buying opportunity, Stu. I think you're right about that. I mean, we're seeing expectations of a slowdown in the economy, but how much slower -- I mean, how significant will that slowdown be? I mean, this has been the issue for about a year now that people are saying things will slow down considerably going into 2020.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, the people that we're talking to and you're talking to, are looking more towards a 2-1/2 percent growth rate for next year. That's nowhere near recession, and it's not that bad. It's a slowdown but it's not that bad. So, I think we may be setting up a really good buying opportunity but we're not quite there yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>VARNEY: You've got to see that just -- I forget the exact word for it, but you got a blowout of sort -- capitulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: We haven't got that yet, but when we do, then maybe you see the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, it's not capitulation when a market closes off of the lows, we were down better than 500 yesterday and we closed down 395. So, I know you're going to have a lot more on it in about 10 minutes, Stu, we'll see you then.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, yes, Larry Kudlow, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Larry Kudlow is coming up. That's going to be such an important interview. Join \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" as Larry Kudlow join Stuart to talk about where we are in this economic story.</p><p>First though, a news alert as we go to break, Boeing reportedly canceling a conference call on the 737 Max jet to discuss the systems on the model. This is the same model involved in a Lion Aircraft that crashed. Here's what Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told me in exclusive interview earlier this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO, BOEING: This is an ongoing investigation, so it will take whatever time is necessary to make sure it's done thoroughly, again, we participate fully in these investigations, we provided technical assistance, we'll continue to do that until the work is complete. The bottom line here is the 737 Max is safe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Boeing shares up -- down 3.8 percent right now. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Holiday shopping headache, a new bank rate survey claims nearly half of Americans feel pressure to overspend during the holiday season. Parents feel the pinch even more with over half of respondents with kids overspending. Joining us now is Ramsey Solutions' financial expert, author of the upcoming book, \"Everyday Millionaires,\" Chris Hogan is here. Chris, good to see you.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how do you avoid overspending?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, Maria, you have to start off with a plan. Make a list of the people that you're going to shop for, assign a dollar amount on what you can afford to spend for that individual, and only spend that amount. I don't want people to wake up in January and have a holiday hangover for the next 18 months, trying to pay off credit card debt when they bought things they couldn't afford.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That makes sense. Lindsey?</p><p>BELL: Yes. Well, what about the ability to just take some people off your list and just not get gifts?</p><p>HOGAN: I don't think there's a problem with that at all, Lindsey, I really don't. If you can't afford to buy a gift, then be creative, think of ways you can make a gift. If they have kids, gift them with babysitting, take them out for a dinner, or make someone a dinner. We've got this mind-set in America that we have to buy a gift in order to give a gift. We can give the gift of time or we can use our talents to be creative.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because when you give people something like I'll babysit your kids, the recipient of that gift knows that that babysitter is never going to show up, and then they're going to have a problem. Again, it's the fact that like at least a gift that you bought in a store is something tangible that like, oh, I can use this bath bomb, not something that, you know, well, I'm going to -- you know, I'll drive you to the mall when you need me to. It just never materializes.</p><p>HOGAN: Dagen, you sound like you've stood some people up with babysitting before.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't -- I don't babysit.</p><p>HOGAN: But I think -- I think if you --</p><p>BELL: You're cracking me up. You're cracking me up.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, I think if you give them a certificate or something. I just don't want people to dig themselves further into a hole. Spending in our debt (INAUDIBLE) situation is pushing toward a trillion dollars. This holiday season is a season where people dig themselves into a hole, that some of them still haven't crawled out from for the last three to four years. So, the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HOGAN: Let's approach this Christmas with cash, make this a cash Christmas, and don't have financial regret.</p><p>FORBES: Well, one way to do it, I won't mention a family member who does it, and that is -- he has a great gift for recycling. So, recycle some of the presents --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, recycled gift. You mean, regift?</p><p>FORBES: Regift.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve Forbes, I know who it is. Should I say who it is on television? It's --</p><p>FORBES: No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Forbes name has nothing to do -- it doesn't represent like somebody who has an endless supply of money, they'll regift something that they got in previous holiday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what's wrong with regifting if it wasn't used?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you were the --</p><p>FORBES: It's the thought that counts.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's like I gave Steve a gift and he gives it back to me the following Christmas, it's a little bit --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes, that's a problem. Chris, thank you, sir. Happy Thanksgiving, Chris Hogan. We'll be right back.</p><p>HOGAN: Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks, everybody, great show.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great show.</p><p>FORBES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have a great day, everybody. Let's get to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" Stuart, take it away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018112003cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSJ-HK11-DXH2-60J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0006T6Y</classCode><className>REGIE NATIONALE DES USINES RENAULT SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002J9K</classCode><className>TARGET CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS522220 SALES FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

I'm Erica Hill, in for Kate Bolduan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right now, President Trump is on his way to visit the U.S. border with Mexico.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Back in Washington, the attorney general and the president's legal team are gearing up for two big fights. On the Mueller report, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler is demanding the Justice Department produce all communications between Bill Barr and the special counsel. Sources tell CNN some members of the Mueller team were unhappy with the attorney general's four-page summary of their nearly 400-page report because it didn't properly convey just how damaging their findings were for President Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then there's the issue of the president's tax returns. The White House is threatening to block Democrats' demand for six years of filings, as the president himself suggests the Justice Department could get involved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Abby Phillip is at the White House.</p><p>Right before leaving this morning, the president was asked again, Abby, about his tax returns. What's the latest from the president?</p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erica, the president hasn't said a whole lot about this issue, but he has reiterated one thing, which is that he is under audit, and while he's under audit, he does not believe he needs to release his tax returns. He's responding to what is not actually a request to him. It's a request from the House Ways and Means Committee to the IRS directly.</p><p>And here's how he responded to another question from reporters this morning about what he thinks about the possibility that his taxes could be released under the law that the Ways and Means Committee is citing in order to make this request.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm under audit. But that's up to whatever it is. From what I understand, the law is 100 percent on my side.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHILLIP: But, Erica, it's really not clear whether the law is 100 percent on his side.</p><p>The Ways and Means Committee is citing a part of the IRS tax code that gives certain congressional committees the right to request an individual's tax returns. Nancy Pelosi said yesterday those kinds of requests have never been denied, but in this case, it would be up to the Trump administration to handle that.</p><p>One interesting point is that the \"New York Times\" is reporting that President Trump weighed in on the nominee for the attorney for the IRS, who would be dealing with these kinds of requests. He asked Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, to speed up this individual's nomination, and it seemed to be an effort for Trump to put someone in that position who might have -- who might see it his way. This is someone who's had some minor dealings with the Trump Organization in his past life before being nominated for this post. And so the implication here is that President Trump has known this is coming down the pike, that Democrats wanted to see his tax returns for a long time, and has been trying to slowly get in position so when there's a legal fight over this, he might be well positioned to win it. We'll see what happens now, but clearly, this is headed toward a big fight and potentially towards the courts.</p><p>HILL: Abby Phillip, with the latest from the White House. Abby, thank you.</p><p>For a closer look on what Democrats in Congress want, let's go to CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Manu, let's start first with Chairman Nadler and what he wants from the Department of Justice.</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, one thing they want is the release of the full Mueller report and the underlying evidence, as, of course, the Judiciary Committee has authorized a subpoena for all that information. Nadler has not served the Justice Department yet. Nadler told me that he's waiting, trying to show accommodation to the Justice Department before ultimately deciding to serve the Justice Department in case this ends up in court so they can argue they did everything they could to convince the Justice Department to comply.</p><p>In the aftermath of these reports showing some tension among some people on Mueller's team with the Justice Department, Nadler is demanding all communications between the Justice Department and Mueller's team over the release of that report. He sent a letter to Bill Barr yesterday demanding this information. That is not a subpoena threat at the moment, but potentially they could turn into one. At the moment, that's where things are. They're trying to pressure the Justice Department to release the full unredacted report. But as we know, Erica, there's no sign yet that the Justice Department is going to listen to that request and there's no sign they won't redact at least some portion of the report. The big question is, how much of the report will be behind those black lines -- Erica?</p><p>HILL: Will be interesting to see.</p><p>Also, Manu, Michael Cohen writing a new letter to Congress. He wants a little more time. What is he asking for specifically?</p><p>RAJU: Yes, he says that he is urging -- his lawyers sent a letter to congressional committees yesterday, Democrats in particular, saying that he needs their help to persuade the Southern District of New York to delay his jail time because, according to this letter from Cohen's attorneys, he has more information that could be helpful to their investigations. Some files that he discovered on a hard drive, apparently, could be helpful to what the Democrats are investigating on the Hill.</p><p>He laid out a number of things he could be helpful in. And in this letter, it says this, it says, \"We hope that this memorandum demonstrates that Mr. Cohen needs to be readily accessible and immediately available to provide ongoing assistance to Congress in order for it to fulfill its executive-branch oversight responsibilities.\"</p><p>[11:05:38] Erica, no word yet from Democrats about whether they will agree to try to persuade federal prosecutors to delay jail time. Republicans pushing back saying this is an effort by Cohen to try to get out of jail. We'll see what information he has to provide and how Democrats ultimately respond -- Erica?</p><p>HILL: Manu, thank you.</p><p>Joining me now, CNN chief political analyst, Gloria Borger, and CNN political commentator, Joe Lockhart, who served as press secretary under President Clinton.</p><p>I may be a little cynical, which happens sometimes, especially in this business, but this letter from Michael Cohen, this promise of, oh, I've got more, we should just wait, it feels a little 11th-hour desperate.</p><p>Joe, how do Democrats handle that?</p><p>JOE LOCKHART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think it's a tough one for Democrats because I think there's a little bait here for there may be something very interesting, but I think Democrats have so far been very careful about calibrating their response. This is a little bit of a trap for them, I think. I think if they start weighing in with SDNY and trying to keep Michael Cohen, who was convicted of very serious crimes, out of jail, that opens them up to legitimate criticism. While it may be tempting, if they were listening to me, I would say stay away from this one.</p><p>HILL: Interesting to say it could be a trap. As we look at everything that is else happening, that has just been laid out for us, Gloria, Democrats turning up the pressure when it comes to -- they don't want to just see the president's personal tax returns. They want to know about his businesses, too. We should point that out because that's important.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITIAL ANALYST: Yes.</p><p>HILL: There's also new reporting from the \"New York Times\" about the president wanting to make sure that the chief counsel was installed at the IRS even before Bill Barr as attorney general, that it was so important to get him there. The White House and the president are not backing down in this fight. Where do Democrats take it?</p><p>BORGER: Well, first, why am I not surprised that the president wanted to install somebody he knew, who had once worked with the Trump Organization in that position, and that he was eager to do it. If you look at the timing of all this, as the \"New York Times\" piece points out, it was around the time the Democrats started saying we're going to get your tax returns, we need to get your tax returns. I think that the Democrats found a very narrow way -- they were very careful about this. They found a very narrow way to ask the president for his tax returns, to ask the IRS to release it. They believe they're on solid ground. The president says they are not on solid ground. Obviously, this may end up in court. We just -- you know, we don't know at this point. The danger here for Democrats, to Joe's point, is you can't be seen to be overreaching on everything. And they're investigating on a multitude of fronts right now. Not only in terms of the Mueller report, but now in terms of the president's tax returns. And so they have to be -- they do have to be careful about this and not to appear to be fishing on everything.</p><p>HILL: So to that point, we know that, in polling, 67 percent of Americans say the president should release his tax returns.</p><p>BORGER: Yes. Sure.</p><p>HILL: There's an appetite to see what's in there.</p><p>But to Gloria's point, Joe, is this the smartest fight right now for Democrats to be picking?</p><p>LOCKHART: Well, I would say, first, the flip side to the Democrats being careful about fishing is the Trump administration can't be stonewalling on everything.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: Exactly.</p><p>LOCKHART: And it really does create this atmosphere that they're hiding on every front.</p><p>I think Gloria makes the right point. Democrats were very smart the way they went after this. They didn't say we want every tax return ever, you know, and without reason. They found a section of the IRS tax code that allows them to get this, a very limited amount, and they're doing that. I expect the administration will block this. He has his man there now. And it will go to court. And if you listen to the legal analysts, who have been on the air talking back and forth, it's a pretty easy case, I think, for the Democrats to win. And you know, one of the things about fishing is, you know, it seems legitimate when the other side is pedaling so hard to stop you from catching anything. I think the Democrats are helped immensely by the strategy that the Trump administration has taken, I think, across the board. They ought to just pull the Band-Aid off on some of these things. It's very painful in the short term, but politics is a business where the subject changes very quickly.</p><p>[11:10:09] HILL: Especially these days.</p><p>LOCKHART: And with the way they're doing it, this is going to hang around until Election Day.</p><p>BORGER: Yes.</p><p>LOCKHART: And that I don't think that's a recipe for success.</p><p>BORGER: And on the release of the Mueller report, don't forget, the House voted unanimously -- and they don't vote unanimously on naming what day it is, right -- they voted unanimously to release the Mueller report. And 80 percent of the public wants to see what's in the Mueller report. And so I think the Democrats on that are on terra- firma. The public is with them on that.</p><p>HILL: But the way we're seeing Barr dig in, right, the changing of the messaging from the president, that's not a surprise. It should not be a surprise any time the messaging changes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILL: -- from the president. But the fact there have been these deadlines thrown out, and there have been demands thrown out, and now the latest letter from Chairman Nadler, and the DOJ responding. The fact is, Barr is not biting. He's not moving.</p><p>BORGER: No. No, but don't forget, on the redactions, he has Mueller sitting on his shoulder.</p><p>HILL: Right.</p><p>BORGER: We don't know if he's there every minute, but he's working with Mueller. I presume that Mueller and his team want their summaries out of what they did in the report, and they want more rather than less. Mueller wasn't born yesterday. He's been around Washington a long time. I presume they wrote a lot of this report knowing it would be released to the public.</p><p>HILL: Right, written in a way that it could be.</p><p>BORGER: Yes, exactly. Scrubbed, pre-scrubbed.</p><p>HILL: Yes. LOCKHART: Remember, what Congress is asking for now is not to release this to the public.</p><p>BORGER: Exactly.</p><p>LOCKHART: There's absolutely no precedent to hold back this information from Congress. Congress gets briefed on the most sensitive national security issues on an almost daily basis. And they are coequal branches with the executive, and there's a level of trust. There will be a debate on what goes to the public, but what Bill Barr is saying right now is, I'm not going to let Congress see anything I don't want Congress to see, and that position is not sustainable.</p><p>BORGER: There's also a question, how much you can say about the president, whom you cannot indict.</p><p>HILL: Right.</p><p>BORGER: So remember Jim Comey, who came out there and didn't -- I'm sure you remember --</p><p>LOCKHART: Yes.</p><p>BORGER: -- he didn't indict, you know, Hillary Clinton but he said she was reckless. So is this equivalent to that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILL: Right. That's the question that keeps coming up.</p><p>BORGER: Yes.</p><p>HILL: Just really quickly for both of you because I love to have you both weigh in, who do you think is winning the messaging war here with the American public? Is it Donald Trump and his camp and Republicans, more the president than Republicans, I would say, or is it the Democrats?</p><p>BORGER: Most of the public still believes the president is not an honest person. However, I think when Trump came out and said, I was exonerated, it had a lot of impact on people. I think the way it's impacted people is they have turned the page. Maybe they don't believe him, but they have turned the page.</p><p>LOCKHART: I think it depends on the messaging. He's won the messaging war. He's always won it with his own base. He's lost it with the Democrats and progressives, which it didn't matter, he was always going to lose it. I think he's lost it with the people in the middle. Let's remember, the day the Mueller -- the Barr letter came out -- let's not call it the Mueller report --</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>LOCKHART: -- came out, he claimed total exoneration. The next poll that came out, three or four days later, said 29 percent of Americans -- only 29 percent of Americans, his base, believed that he was totally exonerated.</p><p>BORGER: Exactly.</p><p>LOCKHART: So on his best day --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILL: And the letter said he was not totally exonerated. Let's not forget that.</p><p>LOCKHART: On his best day, he still had less than a third of the public who believed him. I think to -- what you need to get re- elected, the middle, and either the left or the right, he's lost the messaging war.</p><p>HILL: Joe, Gloria, appreciate it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILL: Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, Joe Biden makes his first public appearance since multiple women alleged inappropriate contact by the former vice president. So will he address the issue this morning?</p><p>[11:13:54] Plus, a rare admission from Boeing after two deadly plane crashes. All this as regulators order a fix for a second software problem. Could Boeing face criminal charges?</p><p>HILL: Minutes from now, Joe Biden will be speaking to the Electrical Workers Union in Washington, his first public appearance since allegations of inappropriate contact with several women surfaced. The big question, of course, today, will the former vice president and possible 2020 candidate address the issue. We'll find out once he takes to the microphone. It will be interesting if he mentions his Twitter tangle with President Trump. The president posted a video mocking Biden over the allegations. Biden tweeting back, \"I see you're on the job and presidential as always.\"</p><p>Joining me now to discuss, CNN political analyst and \"New York Times\" correspondent, Alex Burns, and CNN senior political reporter, Nia Malika Henderson.</p><p>Good to see both of you.</p><p>Nia Malika, as we look at this, it's not clear that Joe Biden is actually planning to address what the rest of the world has been talking about for the last several days. Doesn't he need to?</p><p>NIA MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: You would think he would need to address this at some point. Of course, he had that video. It came up short for some people because it was a non-apology apology. Sorry not/sorry thing going on there. And I think it just highlights the odd position he's in as candidate in waiting presumably. You look at the sort of top words of his video, essentially says you'll be hearing more from me in the weeks to come. So here he is about to give this speech to these union guys, unlikely he will mention it or make any reference to it. But at some point, he will certainly have to. And you imagine those first interviews that he does once he announces, if he announces, as everything points to he will at some point, this will be something he'll have to address. Listen, it will likely be something that hangs over any campaign he launches, because all eyes will be on him as he's out there, if he runs, on the stump interacting with voters.</p><p>[11:20:15] HILL: The president having a field day with this, which is not surprising. The irony, however, appears to be lost on the president in the way he's weighing in.</p><p>But he also had this to say when he was asked this morning about Joe Biden. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I don't see him as a threat. I think he's only a threat to himself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: Alex, does the president have a point there? Is Joe Biden right now the biggest threat to Joe Biden?</p><p>ALEX BURNS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: The president has a point about that. The president is not being on the level when he says he's not concerned about Joe Biden. We know from our reporter and from CNN's reporting that the president is very concerned about Joe Biden. His advisers see Biden as the kind of candidate who would perform well in the areas the president demolished the blue wall of the Midwest in 2016. Absolutely, the biggest unresolved question about Joe Biden's potential campaign, other than whether he will launch it, is just how he will perform on the campaign trail. We haven't seen Joe Biden in the kind of freeform gaggles with reporters that we have seen folks like Beto O'Rourke and Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. When you're suddenly surrounded by TV cameras or talking directly to voters and someone is throwing the Clarence Thomas hearings at you or your record on school busing or abortion or all the stuff over the last week, we have no sense of how prepared Biden is for that moment.</p><p>HILL: We should point out, this is something that has been discussed not just over the last few weeks but really for months as people have been gaming whether over not Joe Biden is going to get in. There's been talk about how extensive his record is, which he likes to play on, but is also a lot of fodder for people to dig through. And even the most recent issues. Maybe you couldn't predict Lucy Flores, but there was cringe-worthy video way back before #metoo that everyone knew was going to be brought up.</p><p>BURNS: It's one of the most frustrating parts of this Joe Biden not- quite campaign for people who are supportive of him. The sense he's taking his time to decide whether to run. He's had a long runway to figure out how to deal with the kinds of things you're talking and really hasn't clearly made the best use of it.</p><p>HILL: Nia Malika, we're waiting to hear from Elizabeth Warren, who is going to call for an end to the filibuster this morning. She wants Democrats to get on board. How do you think that's going to play out?</p><p>HENDERSON: You know, we'll see. As she's linking to this historic fact that the filibuster has been used, she'll say in this speech, basically to block advances in terms of civil rights. I think she's going to specifically refer to some lynching legislation. You know, she is the policy leader in this campaign so far. Policy after policy, whether it's this idea of ending the filibuster, something that the president himself actually agrees upon, other Democrats say, be careful what you wish for, Elizabeth Warren. Because, obviously, if it's Republicans in office, they can use it in the same way that Democrats could use in office as well. So we'll see how she is received at this event. Obviously, this is a cattle call for a number of candidates to try to connect with African-American voters. She's had little success so far in terms of polling. She's down in the low single digits. We'll see what her fundraising is so far. But she's intent on being a policy leader, and really bold policies, changing the Electoral College, this one here about ending the filibuster, breaking up big tech companies. We'll see how she wears with voters going forward, particularly how today she's received with African- American voters. Hasn't had much success so far and much sort of engagement with African-American voters, particularly in Massachusetts, but this, I think, will be a big test for her. We'll see how she handles it.</p><p>HILL: We'll be watching it all.</p><p>Nia Malika Henderson, Alex Burns, good to see you both. Thank you.</p><p>[11:23:57] Coming up, backlash for Boeing as federal regulators order a fix for a second software problem. Were pilots undertrained? And could Boeing face criminal charges?</p><p>HILL: Boeing now acknowledging to the \"Washington Post\" that regulators have ordered the fix of a second flaw in the flight control system of its 737 MAX planes. The planes have been grounded after two fatal crashes less than five months apart.</p><p>Boeing's CEO has made a statement that is actually raising more than a few eyebrows.</p><p>CNN's Drew Griffin has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The CEO of Boeing making a rare admission, accepting blame for two of its airliners that crashed.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO, BOEING: It's apparent that in both flights, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, known as MCAS, activated in response to erroneous angle-of-attack information. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it. And we know how to do it.</p><p>GRIFFIN: The video message from Boeing comes after a devastating preliminary report laying out that a software issue apparently caused the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight last month. The report also suggesting the same issue may have caused a Lion Air flight to go down last year. The preliminary report finds the pilots did everything required to try to bring the plane back safely, but ultimately couldn't control it.</p><p>Former Boeing operations analyst, Rick Ludtke, says during development of the 737 MAX, Boeing had a mandate, make sure any changes to the plane would not require additional pilot training in a simulator.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019040501CNV59</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTN-K471-DXH2-6346-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

Reposts a tweet the social media giant had concealed for violating its rules against 'glorifying violence' Twitter said his words were 'glorifying violence' and hid the post, although readers could still click through to get access.In response, the official White House account called Twitter's bluff by re-tweeting the same post. This time, Twitter responded by saying that while it violated its rules, the company 'determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.'The White House later defended Trump's tweet, saying: 'The president did not glorify violence. </p><p>He clearly condemned it.'And Trump's social media director and Twitter feed manager, Dan Scavino, had his own response. 'Twitter is full of shit \u2014 more and more people are beginning to get it,' he wrote on Twitter.The latest spat came a day after Trump signed an executive order in the Oval Office seeking to transform the way social media companies are regulated.That followed Trump's fury over Twitter tagging two of his tweets with fact checks, which was also an unprecedented measure.Trump claims that the platform, where he dwarfs the presence of his Democratic rival Joe Biden for the November presidential election, is biased against him.One immediate result of the blow-up between the social media-savvy president and the high-profile company has been to knock the coronavirus pandemic and recently reached toll of 100,000 dead Americans out of the headlines.It also ties in with one of Trump's major re-election themes: that despite being a billionaire White House incumbent with a Republican majority in the Senate is an outsider fighting a left-wing establishment.End to self-regulation?Trump's executive order seeks to remove social media platforms' decades-long freedom from liability for content posted. Instead of being allowed to self-regulate, this would treat the companies more like traditional publishers, open to government regulation and court challenges over false or harmful material.Trump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms 'have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences'. 'We can't let this continue to happen,' he said.Ironically, his order could spur companies like Twitter to impose stricter lines for users, eventually curbing social media firebrands like Trump himself, who regularly goes online to insult people and support conspiracy theories.How much will change in the near term is unclear, given the legal and political challenges facing Trump's move.Critics say Trump has no authority to regulate private internet operators or change the law, known as Section 230, which backers say has allowed online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to flourish.The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order 'a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president'.Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was 'more about political theatre than about changing the law.'The order 'is not legally supportable \u2014 it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions,' Goldman said.Published in Dawn, May 30th, 2020 </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-RPNW108463159081304582125876100092</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RPNW-7005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6018-JFF1-JCMN-Y36K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><timeReceived>4:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Dawn</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 30, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good Thursday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  April 26.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m.  on the East Coast.   Earnings in focus on Wall Street.  Futures indicated to open stronger this  morning.  Stocks are expected to be up at the start of trading with Dow up  55, NASDAQ up 42.  Technology bigwigs, Amazon and Microsoft headlining the  biggest earning season of -- earnings day of the season rather.  This is  the single busiest earnings day of the quarter.  Both are due out after the  bell tonight.  We'll be watching those.  General Motors meanwhile beat  expectations last hour.  The stock is under pressure however over the  automaker's high restructuring expenses, stock down two percent.</p><p>Facebook meanwhile, shaking off the scandal.  Shares soaring in the  premarket up almost seven percent after the company beat expectations  yesterday and posted strong growth in daily users.  Take a look at European  indices this morning after the ECB left interest rates unchanged last hour,  the Ft-100 now changed very much.  The CAC quarante is up about a half of a  percent and the DAX Index up a quarter of a percent.  We are waiting on the  ECB President Mario Draghi to start his news conference, that starts in  about 30 minutes and we'll tell you if there's anything else that he says  that might be market moving.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  Shanghai Composite was the worst performer down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump's pick to head the Department  of Veterans Affairs has pulled his name out of consideration.  The details  as Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination in a growing scrutiny from  lawmakers.  And the West Wing, Kanye not backing down from his support of  President Trump.  The Rapper's powerful message to his critics coming up.   A new robot that's more than meets the eye how scientists in Japan created  a real life transformer.  All of those coming up this morning and joining  me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall  Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman along with  Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth.  Great  to see you guys.  </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And great show so far.  We got a lot on the docket.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Sad story about Ronny Jackson.   This guy has really  served his country honorably and well and this is how Washington treats him  on the way out.  Just horrendous.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that is the news of the moment. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know if he's going to remain the doctor at the White  House but really, he didn't deserve this.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Well, it's a way for some people to try and  discourage from anybody serving in the Trump administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  A way to create chaos in President Trump's  administration.  That is the breaking news.  Dr. Ronny Jackson has  withdrawn as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Blake Burman is  live at the White House with all the details right now.  And Blake, the  news just broke about 10 minutes ago.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.  And Ronny Jackson has put out a  statement within the last few minutes here, Maria.  the bottom line with  this was the allegations just continue to pile and pile up against Dr.  Jackson who is the White House doctor had served under President George W.  Bush, President Obama, and now as the personal doctor as well to President  Trump who nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The  allegations were that he was drinking on the job, overprescribing medicine,  fostering a hostile work environment.  </p><p>Jackson had denied all of that but this morning says he does not want to go  forward with this process.  In a statement Jackson says the following,  \"going into the process, I expected tough questions about how to best care  for our veterans but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and  anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.  </p><p>He goes on to say, \"the allegations against me are completely false and  fabricating.  If they had any merit, I would not have been selected,  promoted, and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as  physician to three Presidents over the past 12 years.\"  The White House  throughout all of this over the last few days continues to stand by  Jackson, there was a Press Secretary Sarah Sanders joining the briefing  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Through Jackson's  record as a White House physician has been impeccable.  In fact because Dr.  Jackson has worked within arm's reach of three Presidents, he has received  more vetting than most nominees.  Given this unique position of trust and  responsibility, Dr. Jackson's background and character were evaluated  during three different administrations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  One thing that keep in mind here, Maria, is before all of these  allegations started rolling in and before the folks up on Capitol Hill put  a temporary pause on the nomination process.  There were serious questions  about whether or not Jackson was qualified to handle such a huge  bureaucracy.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, the President during that  news conference with Emmanuel Macron backed Jackson by saying look, this is  his decision to make, he is a qualified to lead this department and we will  find out from Jackson what he decides to do.  This morning, we have found  out he has pulled his name out from the nomination process and now the  White House has yet another open slot to fill, someone to lead the V.A.   Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that is exactly what the left and the resist movement wants  as much chaos as possible around the Trump administration.  Joining us  right now is Gianno Caldwell, we just saw in the moment.  Gianno, thanks  very much for being here this morning.  Fox News Political Analyst,  Republican strategists, Caldwell strategic consulting founder.  Your  reaction to this.  I mean, obviously, this is more -- booby traps in the  Trump administration.  Who leaked all of this or created this around Dr.  Ronny Jackson forcing him to withdraw in your view? </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  We've seen leaks throughout  this entire start of this administration.  And I think it's very  unfortunate.  Further, I think Sarah Sanders said something that was  particularly interesting and I -- and I thought to be very true that Dr.  Ronny Jackson is an individual who's been vetted by three administrations.   So if these were to be true why wasn't that found to be the case in these  other vetting processes?  So it's something that I think that's obviously  harmful to the Trump administration because we've seen nominees put their  name in and have to withdraw.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  So that particularly problematic.  And I'm sad to see him go but  I know that there are some other good people that can step in his place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  I think an excellent candidate with V.P. to be the new V.A.  secretary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, exact -- well, we talked about that earlier, you're  absolutely right.  But I mean, is -- are the people going to -- going to  come forward and make noise about this?  How is this going to stop with all  of these, you know, booby traps and barriers that the resist movement is  putting in place for the Trump administration? </p><p>HEGSETH:  I think your only option in situation like this is to fight back  and fight back ferociously because it isn't just the leaks, it isn't just  the Obama administration.  Do watch other networks --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The media.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They go wall-to-wall on person speculation, anonymously source  with no verification to smear this guy.  I was forced to watch one of these  other networks yesterday for whatever reason and they didn't stop, it was  all Ronny Jackson, all based on nothing.  Gianno, how do you overcome that  in this environment?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know what, I think that's why it's been President Trump's  best quality.  You saw that through the 2015 election where they would  smear him, they would come at him hard and he wouldn't back down.  And I  think that that President Trump is going to people who love and that's the  reason why he actually won the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And we have to see more of that just that we're going to push  back, we're going to push book no matter what you say and how you try to  smear people because these are legitimately good people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all shaming, it's public shaming.  I'll tell you who  is pushing back, Kanye West.  He's calling it the mob.  Let's talk about  his Make America Great moment.  The rapper face backlash for praising  President Trump yesterday posting on Twitter.  Here's what he said, Kanye  West.  You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob cannot make me not  love him.  We are both dragging energy, he is my brother, I love everyone,  I don't agree with everything anyone does.  That's what makes us  individuals and we have the right to independent thought.  Amen to Kanye  West.  Good for him.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Amen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He goes on to -- and then the President actually responded, and  the President tweeted out, thank you, Kanye.  Very cool.  Gianno, your  reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know, it's interesting.  I'm in my hometown at Chicago right  now and of course this is where Kanye is from.  And I'll be talking about  this on largest urban radio station after this interview but this is I  think excellent.  And I'll tell you why I think it's excellent.  Kanye West  has been an individual who's not willing to back down, he's unrelenting in  what he believes.  And I think that the degree, he really appreciates that  in President Trump more than anything.  </p><p>We saw in the 2016 election as I mentioned before, President Trump did not  back down, whatsoever and I wrote a piece about him in the Hill why the  Republican base (INAUDIBLE) it won't break and he read it and sent me a  note.  And in that piece, I said that the Republicans chose him as the guy  that they wanted to win elections because after the media began to attack  him and he was losing business deals, he lost millions saying what he  believes.  </p><p>He didn't step back like most businessmen would, he didn't step back like  most politicians would, he doubled down on it.  And with that being the  case, then says that I'm unapologetic in my view, I'm unapologetic in  American First policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And I'm unapologetic keeping our country safe.  And I think most  people can appreciate that, most people can evaluate that and most people  voted for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gianno though, it's Dagen.  Never forget, Kanye is always about  Kanye.  Kanye is not about -- he is not -- he is not standing up for any  issue quite frankly, he is doing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a shame.  He's pushing back on shaming, calling them  the mob.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I argue that he is doing it for the attention because he knows  that basically siding with President Trump will get him the most attention.   Going after President Obama will get him the most attention.  He isn't  married to the Kardashian clan after all.  Maybe they're learning from him  rather than the other way around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But this also started after the USA communications  director Candace Owens, she hit back at the Democratic Party and she  defend-- she was Fox last night with Martha.  Listen to how she defended  Kanye and what she said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CANDACE OWENS, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Once they inflate our body's  Democratic Party, let's say they haven't slayed our minds, they have told  true who we must love, who we must hate, what we must think, what ideas are  unacceptable.  In the long run, it just -- it just doesn't add up.  Listen,  I think differently, Kanye West thinks differently.  I can guarantee you if  he and I get in the same room, we will have a lot of disagreements.  The  one thing that we will celebrate is our right to think differently.  I  don't understand what's so controversial for the left to understand this.   The way that they had demonized him in the last 72 hours, it's almost  sickening but at the end of the day it's going to have adverse effects.  I  can guarantee you that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well said, Candace.  Gianno, what do you make of all of this?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  I agree with what Candace has said and I'm going to have to push  back on Dagen just a -- just a bit respectfully.  Kanye is about himself,  that's unquestionable.  I know we all realize that.  However, this is an  individual who definitely has gone against ever since I have known him  before he became a national figure.  The marginalization of thought.   Specifically marginalization of who we are as individuals so often as the  society were programmed.  </p><p>I believe to do what's reasonable and what were pretty much taught in  school and I think he goes beyond that and says look, let's look deep  inside ourselves and fulfill our greatest potential.  And generally  speaking when you do that, when you legitimately do that, it's going to  make people uncomfortable and say, hey what you're doing is unreasonable  and maybe you should rethink your decision but generally speaking the  greatest folks we've seen, Mark Zuckerberg, Kanye West, Donald Trump, the  individuals that really succeeded become these megastars are the ones that  go beyond what's public as a final thought.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.  James Freeman here at the Journal.  I'm not sure why  we're talking about Kanye allegedly being all about himself.  I mean, I  don't know -- I don't know what's in his head but the idea that someone  puts out a message that compliments the President, encourages people to  think freely, and says he loves everyone.  Or why are you saying -- well,  he's about himself?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can ask me that question because I'm the one who said it --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- James because he does -- he does and says things to garner  the most attention.  And so being complimentary in this environment,  President Obama is not going to garner him the most attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he has courage by saying it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to --</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's triggering a very important conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- he -- Kanye West has never lacked courage.  I'm not  arguing that.  I'm just saying that there's always a motive and it is about  -- Kanye is not right or left, not Democrat or Republican, Kanye is Kanye  at the end of the day.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  He has an album that's coming out and he loves --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. The album is coming out.</p><p>CALDWELL:  -- due to his compliments in the President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this -- they shame you if you say anything positive about  the President.  You know, you get shamed online if you say anything  positive about the President.  I like to see somebody, who pushes back  because it's wrong.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And he's is breaking the mode on that, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's breaking --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  Because we've got -- we've gone to an extreme point in time  where you can't say anything complimentary about President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Former FBI Director Jim Comey who's been  trashing the President in every interview and he leaked memos, a catalyst  for the special counsel investigation.  That memo was more wildly shared  than we thought initially.  Sources telling Fox News Comey likely gave the  documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another  person along with the with Columbia Law School professor and watch Comey  struggle to defend his actions last night at a CNN town hall.  Listen to  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  You did leak memos, I mean, is it OK for  somebody at the FBI to leak something, an internal document even if it's  not classified?  Isn't that leaking? </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  It was a whole lot wrong with your  question, Anderson.  First, I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to  communicate the substance of one unclassified </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that  it'd be out in media, I wanted it to get in the media.  As a private  citizen, I could do that and did that just as I have written about it in my  book.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does he think just saying this is going to make people think  otherwise?  We're -- we saw what happened.  Gianno, your reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  That is my definition leaking.  He gave information and now,  this is developing at the harvest of the FBI and he gave it to a friend, to  spring this special counsel and if I -- if I recall correctly, I think it  was reported at The Washington -- Wall Street Journal who said after  reading the Comey memos, there is -- they see no reason why there should  have been a special counsel to begin with.  So with that being the case,  Jim Comey definitely is in a position where he's losing all credibility if  he had any left.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget that zero intelligence that was used  to launch the investigation which Devin Nunes told us about.  Gianno, thank  you.  Good to see you.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Good seeing you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive dragnet in Maine after a man shot and  killed a sheriff's deputy.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, John Williams.  They say that the 29-year-old gunned down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine.  That is just  North of Augusta.  Williams drove the cruiser to a nearby convenience store  and he robbed it.  Police releasing this photo, this captured of him from  inside of the stolen car.  He then abandoned that car nearby, he has not  been seen since.  Deputy Cole had been on the force 13 years. He leaves  behind a son.  The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot at  a Dallas Home Depot, one of them was killed there.  Officer Rogelio  Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him  in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest.  22 officers have  been shot and killed so far this year.  That is more than double from the  same time last year and on average, you're not going to believe this, at  least one officer has reportedly been shot to death every week in 2018.  </p><p>Well, earning season is in high gear this morning.  We're just getting  results from a couple of big airlines, you know, and let's start with  American, the stock is trading lower almost 4-1/2 percent to the downside  in the premarket.  Their first quarter revenue just missed the street  estimate.  Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents actually topped  expectations, not helping out though.  Let's take a look at Southwest, they  also are under pressure ahead of the opening bell down more than 3-1/2  percent.  Revenue coming up short of estimates.  Southwest did add -- the  bookings are down after an engine on its one planes exploded last week  killing a passenger and that was Southwest's first fatality in the  carrier's history.  </p><p>And then finally there's this.  You want to be careful, the next car that  you hop in to might be Megatron.  Japanese engineers created a real life  Transformer that can actually carry people onboard.  This is the first  scene we've ever seen anything like this.  It's a robot car.  It walks over  18 miles an hour and transforms into a sports car with people still inside.   The robot creator says he was yes inspired by his childhood Transformer  heroes that he watched in the movies in growing up.  There you have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, very cool.</p><p>CASONE:  Very cool.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  The outlook on trade with China, big delegation  going next week.  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers will weigh in on the  new report that Chinese companies are already reconsidering investments in  the American market as Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary gets set to  visit his counterpart in China next week.  Then founding partner of  AlphaOne Capital Partners Dan Niles joins me to talk about Facebook's  quarterly results, he predicted the company would beat.  I'll get his take  on the company's surging revenue and where it goes next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Focus on Facebook.  The social media company  beat earnings and revenue expectations last night despite the fallout from  the privacy scandal.  Yesterday, Facebook reported adjusted earnings per  share of $1.69 on revenue of $11.97 billion.  That was the first quarter of  2018.  Shares of Facebook right now are up seven percent in the premarket.   Joining us right now on the telephone is the founding partner of AlphaOne  Capital Partners, Dan Niles.  One of his big positions is Facebook.  And  Dan, good to have you.  Thanks very much for weighing in here.  You  predicted that the company would beat revenue and earnings expectations.   What's your take away from the numbers?</p><p>DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDING PARTNER (via telephone):  I  mean, quite honestly, it's even better than what I was expecting.  You have  to look at the revenues first and revenues year-over-year in the June  quarter were up 45 percent.  And the September and December quarters,  accelerated up 47 percent.  And what's interesting is even with all the  negative publicity around the supposed data scandal, the revenues  accelerates 50 percent year over year in (INAUDIBLE) they keep the  operating income by about 14 percent where their margins were better than  expected and they keep the ETF by over 20 percent.  I mean, back out some  of the one time.  So it's really hard to find a whole lot negative in the  report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about expenses going forward in this whole regulatory  scrutiny?  I mean, are we going to see, you know, new rules regulations  that this company is going to have to adhere to in the entire industry,  we'll have to adhere to that will change the reason to own the stock  because expenses are higher?</p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I really don't think so.  I mean, here is a way to think  about it.  Even though expenses they guided to up 50 to 60 percent,  originally they guided up 45 to 60.  Estimates are actually going up after  this print because they beat the operating income margins by so much that  even though their guiding expenses higher most of the street is actually  raising EPS.  </p><p>The second thing is, I'm sure there will be some extra regulations they  need to adhere to, obviously they talk on the call about the general  protection regulations coming out on May 25th in Europe but the interesting  thing as they said, even with those regulations, they don't anticipate  those changes really significantly impacting our revenue, they do think  daily active users could be cracked down in the second quarter but, you  know, that's really not affecting the revenues.  </p><p>And quite honestly the extra regulations with them, it will -- it will help  make their site a lot safer and to some extent it's going to impact their  smaller competitors a lot more.  They don't have same resources as Facebook  to comply with that. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Hi, Dan.  James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal.  I'd like to  talk about those potential smaller competitors.  Normally those kind of fat  profit margins attract competition.  Who is it that can challenge Facebook,  either among startups or existing tech giants moving into their business. </p><p>NILES:  Well, I mean, you obviously know the list of characters, you've got  Twitter, you've got Snapchat obviously, two public companies talked about  most often.  But I mean, they've been competing since the beginning and  you've obviously seen this market is, you know, not necessarily winner take  post but it's sort evolving that way as Facebook continues to execute and  they're executing really across all of the metrics.  So it's not just  growing revenue but they're highly, highly profitable.  </p><p>They have 46 percent operating marks. And so -- and you have to remember,  to some extent they are a startup in different businesses, so we talked  about Facebook, they've got 2.2 billion users and Instagram 800 million  users, so that's great.  What we don't talk about that much is the 1.3  billion users for Facebook messenger is that they just started to make  money off of and they make absolutely no money off of the 1.5 billion  WhatsApp users.  </p><p>So they've got -- to some extent two startups buried within the company  between Messenger and WhatsApp that they still haven't really started to  monetize yet and that gives me a lot of comfort especially when you look at  the multiples of trading at 20 times non-gap, you know, under 18 earnings.   Markets up 17.  These are growing the top line at 50 percent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The world is wash in venture capital.  Are new competitors being  funded?  And if not, why not?  Is Facebook seen as so dominate that that  won't work? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, I think people are trying to work around the edges  but you have to remember with Facebook, there is something pretty unique  which is the network effect.  You're not going to get off of Facebook and  go to Google plus if your friends aren't there.  So, you can't really  easily switch.  If you're dealing with Google for example and somebody came  out with a much better search engine, you know, there's nothing to stop you  from going to the other one, the problem with this is that even if somebody  didn't develop a great other alternative social media site, you're not  going to move unless all of your friends move too.  And that's probably not  going to happen immediately.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan, real quick.  Intel and Microsoft after the bell tonight,  good quarters?  What are you expecting? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, Intel is one of our largest positions.  We like it  quite a bit.  I think the real key for Intel is enterprise demand has been  really bad for the last couple years.  That really started to improve in  the fourth quarter and I think it's going to be very good for this year.   So we like Intel a lot and it's got a low multiple as well in this  environment at about 14 times.  So we like that quite a bit and Microsoft,  similarly we think they should have a pretty solid quarter.  A multiple is  quite a bit higher at 24 times, so not as preferred to us as Intel. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Dan, always great to talk  with you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>NILES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Dan Niles joining us there.  AlphaOne  Capital.  Coming up.  House Republican Conference chair and Washington  Congressman Cathy McMorris Rogders joins me next. We'll get her take on  French President Macron's state visit with President Trump, trade, and a  lot more.  Then a new twist on coffee just in time for summer.  Starbucks  introducing cold foam before reporting earnings after the bell tonight.  We  break down the expectations.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first-quarter earnings, General Motors and Pepsico among  the companies reporting their first-quarter this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations, while PepsiCo was mixed.  Both stocks are under some selling  pressure this morning by a fraction.  Investors are waiting on big tech.   Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all reporting, after the close tonight, all the  stocks are trading up about two percent right now.  </p><p>Broader markets this morning are higher.  March durable goods just came out  up 2.6 percent versus an estimate of 1.6 percent that was better than  expected.  The news is a positive for markets, and we are seeing a pretty  good tone today.  The Dow Industrials set to open about 50 points, that's a  quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up a third of a percent right now.  And the NASDAQ up 50 points,  that's three-quarters of one percent.  The Dow yesterday snapped a five-day  losing streak.  And the momentum continues today.  That was lifted by  Boeing's big earnings beat.  Boeing's stock did well as did the Dow up 60  points at the close, a quarter of a percent higher.  The S&amp;P was also  fractionally better on the day.  The NASDAQ yesterday, closed lower by  three points.  </p><p>In Europe, this morning, the major indices are higher.  The European  Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, and Mario Draghi is about to  speak in his press conference.  FT-100 up 7-1/2, CAC Quarante up 35, that's  two-thirds of a percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a  percent, 43 points higher.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>President Trump lashing out against Jim Comey.  He's targeting the former  FBI Director on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago.  We will tell you what the  President just told our colleagues there.  And breaking news this morning,  Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination as Secretary of Veterans  Affairs.  President Trump weighed in on the announcement earlier this hour  on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" he placed the blame squarely on Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I even told them a day or  two ago.  I saw this was -- where this was going.  And you know they're  very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again first in his class at West  Point, top in class at Harvard Law School, a brilliant guy, a great guy,  and somebody I get along with very well.  You know, Mike got through and  they thought they had him stopped.  The Democrats are obstructionists.   It's horrible what they're doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Capitol Hill coming up this morning.  And then  just in time for summer, Starbucks added -- adds cold foam.  The details  ahead of the company's earnings report later this hour.  The stock is up,  half of a percent.  Plus, it is National Pretzel Day.  We are celebrating  pretzel day here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Wait until you see this pretzel  that they made of my face.  I don't -- I don't think it looks like me but  let me see if I can grab this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is Pretzel Day.  There you go.  OK, we'll get to that coming  up this morning, but first, our top story right now, President Trump  lashing out at Jim Comey, this morning.  Here's what he had to say about  the fired FBI Director in a new interview this morning with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\"  moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Comey is a leaker and he's a liar.  And not only on this stuff,  he's been leaking for years.  He's probably been using his friend, the so- called professor, who now turns out to have FBI clearance which he never  said.  He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress, he  said he gave it to a friend.  And he gave it to a friend to leak classified  information.  It is all classified, it was totally classified.  So, he  illegally -- he did an illegal act, and he said it himself, in order to get  a special counsel against me. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is House Republican Conference Chair and  Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Good to see you,  Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p>REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R), WASHINGTON, CHAIR, HOUSE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this.  You know, I was actually really struck  by the interview last night that Comey did with CNN, and basically he said,  no, I didn't leak anything but then went on to talk about how, in fact, he  did leak these memos that he wrote which as soon as an FBI Director writes  a memo in FBI, you know, headquarters, that is the property of the FBI, but  he said he passed it on to his friend and told his friend, oh, just get  this to the New York Times but don't actually give them the paper, and he  said that's not leaking.  Your reaction.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, it's -- yes, it begs a lot of questions.  And in someone  who believes it's so important that we are restoring trust, that we're  restoring the rule of law in this country, the FBI is the highest law  enforcement agency.  This is -- the people within the FBI must be held to  the highest standards, and that is what causes me so much dismay right now  is just the cloud that is over the FBI, and the questions that it has  raised.  We need the men and women there to act in the utmost authority, as  well as transparency and accountability to the American people.  And so,  yes, he clearly leaked, and it raises a lot of questions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is there going to be any accountability here,  Congresswoman?  I mean, look, last weekend, I had your colleague,  Congressman Devin Nunes on my Sunday morning program and he said, after  looking at all the electronic communications, he realized that there was no  intelligence used to actually launch an investigation into the Trump  campaign.  So, what happens now?  I mean, can we just keep seeing, you  know, people at the top of these important agencies abuse their power with  no accountability?</p><p>RODGERS:  No one is above the law and they must be held accountable.  And  that's the role of Congress, that's the role of the elected representatives  of the people within the House to make sure that we are taking action to  hold them accountable.  So, both in the Intelligence Committee as well as  the government oversight and reform committee which Trey Gowdy is the  chairman of, that's where these questions are asked and that's where  there's been frustration, that documents have not been turned over, that  people have not been as forthright in answering the questions, but it is up  to us to make sure that people are held accountable and that no one is  above the law. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, we'll be watching what develops then.  Then  there is this, the breaking news this breaking news this morning,  Congresswoman, and that is Dr. Ronny Jackson withdrawing his name for  consideration for the head of the V.A., President Trump's pick to lead the  Department of Veterans Affairs pulled his nomination in the last hour amid  all of these questions surrounding his professional conduct.   Congresswoman, your reaction to this news?</p><p>RODGERS:  I respect his decision.  It's most important that we get someone  at the V.A.  Again, we need to restore trust between the veterans and this  agency whose mission is to serve our veterans.  And as someone who  represents nearly 70,000 veterans in eastern Washington, I hear regularly  from veterans who feel like when they contact the V.A. that they're more of  a burden than actually having the red carpet rolled out for them.  So, we  need someone to head up the V.A., we need to get focused on the mission of  the V.A., and make sure that our veterans, those who have served are  getting the care that they need when the time comes, that has to be a top  priority for us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean, can we just ignore all of the barriers and the  booby traps that the left is putting in place for the Trump administration?   I mean, look at all of the positions that are yet unfilled.  Look at all of  the slow walking going on in terms of getting his nominees passed.  You  know, Mike Pompeo got -- you know, got support, but it was close.  I mean,  what about that, who is doing this?  We know that three administrations  have said how great Dr. Ronny Jackson is and all of a sudden, somebody  leaks all of this speculation about his personal life.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, that is -- yes, that's tough to see, and I respect his  decision just to pull out.  I am concerned that the left is putting  politics ahead of what's best for the country, and there's so many --  there's the V.A. position, Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, he's an  honorable man, a well-respected leader, he's proven himself, and yet too  many were willing to put politics ahead of what was best for the country.   We do need to get these people in place because that is part of making sure  that President Trump has the people around him to actually lead, and people  equal policy and he needs these people in place so that we can keep moving  forward.  There's a lot on our plate right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think people are figuring this out, that there's -- all of  these booby traps that are being put in by the skeptics and critics of  President Trump.  And then there's China, of course, reportedly threatening  to \"fierce counterstrike\" if the President goes ahead with these another  $100 billion in tariffs as punishment for the alleged intellectual property  theft.  Congressman, your thoughts on this.  I know Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary and a whole delegation are going next week to meet with  their counterparts in China to talk this out.</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, there's too many examples of illegal practices by  China, where we have seen them taking our intellectual property and  duplicating it.  I have examples in Eastern Washington, Washington State,  and it destroys companies here in America.  I am encouraged that President  Trump is focused on making sure that we hold China accountable.  I have had  concerns about the across-the-board approach to tariffs that, you know, he  was talking about imposing upon steel and aluminum.  I do believe it needs  to be more targeted but we must hold a country like China accountable for  illegal practices or free and fair trade will never work. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bottom line, do you think that the President with his tough  talk and the team is going to be able to account that budget deficit with  China, which is already now up to 375 billion?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, if anyone can do it, I believe it's President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes,</p><p>RODGERS:  And he is focused on this.  I had the chance to spend some time  with Larry Kudlow just last week.  I'm really pleased to see him as the  head of the economic advisors, his chief economic adviser.  He understands  economics, world trade, and also what's going on in China.  And he  basically told us everything is on the table, tariffs, no tariffs,  sanctions, but we must hold them accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's going to be on that trip as well, Larry Kudlow, and  Peter Navarro.  What about this budget about face, Congresswoman?   President Trump is now urging lawmakers to rescind some of the spending of  that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill which he signed last month.   Congresswoman, are there enough votes to make it happen and obviously you  must be getting just as much pushback as so many others are, for signing  that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill with all the spending?</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, we must address the spending in this country.  It  is the number one threat that faces us, both from a military perspective as  well as economic perspective, we needed to get a budget in place, but it  spends too much, and that's where I am -- I'm actually encouraged that the  President, Mick Mulvaney is leading on putting together a rescission  package.  </p><p>We should have been doing this all along, really taking a look at those  opportunities to go into programs, go into agencies and actually through  the House and the Senate, cut the spending.  The budget process is broken,  the House passed all 12 of our appropriations bills.  We went through  program by program, agency by agency, the Senate did zero.  So, this has  been very frustrating.  </p><p>This is our fundamental job as the elected representatives, this is where  we exercise the power of the purse, and yet this process is broken.  So, I  am -- I definitely want to look at what the President -- what they can  propose.  I think the House and Senate should also be using this tool of  rescissions to take action that we can to reduce those deficits and reduce  the debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his three-day  state visit with an address to the joint meeting of Congress.  How was it,  what was your takeaway?  He was critical of the President's planned  withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, I think, it is important that these conversations continue.   I've never been a supporter of the Iran deal.  I thought it was bad deal.   It did not hold Iran accountable for not developing or obtaining nuclear  weapons.  And that's where we need our European allies to join us in making  sure that we have a deal that is going to accomplish the goal of ensuring  that they do not develop nuclear weapons.  And right now, we do not have  that confidence. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, real quick, who are you supporting for Speaker of  the House?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, you know, I -- we need to make sure that we are voting on a  Republican speaker after the elections, so we need to stay focused on the  policy and on our midterms and making sure that we're getting that done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Thanks so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ford Motor now pulling all but two of its  passenger cars from its North American line up as part of a plan to save  money and make the company more competitive.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  Stu, a car company canceling all of its  cars?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Well, you know, if you can't make money  selling cars, I guess you forget about selling cars, and you go to light  trucks and SUVs because that's where the money is.  It's a perfectly  rational move but boy, does it come as a shock.  You know, when I think of  the Ford Motor company, I think of the Taurus, one of the best-selling  marks for almost a generation.  It's gone.  They're not going to sell that  thing in North America any longer.  The Fiesta is going.  A couple of other  marks, I guess you'd call them, are going.  I was just shocked to hear  that.  It's a car company, but it's not a car company.  It's now a light  truck and SUV company because it wants to make some more money.  Look at  the stock, up 2-1/2 percent, just because its walking away from the car  market.  I wondered if General Motors will do something similar or FiatChrysler, walk away from unprofitable lines because you got to make money  in this environment and that's what you got to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really fascinating.</p><p>VARNEY:  I find it fascinating, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is -- it is fascinating.  And remember the last CEO wanted  to make it a mobility company.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  My, how times change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  I know you'll have a  lot more on it.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Sure, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart.  It is the busiest day of  the earnings season today, G.M. one of the big names out this morning.   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the  numbers.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The busiest day  of 68 S&amp;P 500 companies, and to your point, your chat with Stuart, guess  what, G.M. is doing much of the same, focusing on a highly-profitable  pickup trucks, and that's what's costing them going forward for 2018.  So,  for the quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line.  Profit was on  the rise, and it's the high-margin vehicles that they're going to be  working on.  So, 2018, they expect that they will have flat profits but  expect the all new pickup trucks would boost the margins in 2019.  The  stock is down a half of one percent.  </p><p>Then, let's take a look at Starbucks.  So, we're expecting for Starbucks to  report after the bell today.  Global same-store sales are likely on the  rise to the tune of about 1.8 percent.  They still, obviously or have the  P.R. that they have to deal with from Philadelphia, removing those two  black men, but big spot is China.  That's where they see the growth.  In  fact, they're opening one new store in China every 15 hours.  And also, you  can get cold foam on your new -- on your new Starbucks.  All right, Dagen,  back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  So, coming up, it's not your average  day.  We are celebrating National Pretzel Day.  Maria's pretzel with a  small business is growing fast.  We take you live to plaza, where there is  a pretzel truck waiting.  I've already eaten one, they're delicious.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you outside on the plaza,  outside headquarters.  What a twist in this National Pretzel Day.  We are  celebrating in style with a small business that is growing fast.  Joining  me right now is Dan Dizio, he's the CEO and co-founder of Philly Pretzel  Factory and we've got the team here ready to munch on all pretzels.  Dan,  great to see you.  </p><p>DAN DIZIO, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY:  Me, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, and I love the MORNINGS WITH  MARIA in pretzel.  That is very cool, nice touch.  You've been selling  pretzels since you're 11 on the corner in Philadelphia.  Tell us how you  started your business.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, my next door neighbor had a pretzel bakery, got stuck with a  bunch of pretzels.  I'm 47 now.  This week, I'll be 47.  And he got stuck.   A woman asked if I would sell them on the shoe corner and we would split  the money.  And my mom said it would be OK.  He had to ask my mom  permission, and, for some reasons, my mom said it would be OK to stand on  the street corner all day (INAUDIBLE) but she said it was a different time  back then.  So -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  And, yes, I did it, and did real well, and the next thing I know  every guy was selling pretzels, and did all through middle school and high  school.  And I went to college and was a graduate, and had a stockbroker  job and just didn't like the 9:00 to 5:00 thing, and I want to get back to  the pretzel business and I talked my college roommate into doing a pretzel  business and that's how it started, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You started with the food truck, the Philly Pretzel Factory,  you've got the food truck -- Hi, everybody.  Did you have a pretzel?  Tell  me about the food truck business because this is a really successful way to  sell.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we've had the truck for a few years now.  We're really doing  well with the weddings, bar mitzvahs, just different event.  I mean,  there's different places we could take it, so it'd be mobile.  That's the  way you have to be in this moment right now as for -- be able to  (INAUDIBLE) and be able to bring the pretzel to the people where they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, you have 170 locations across the country.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're opening more stores.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we're actually opening up 25 in New York right now.  We just  did area development deal to open up 25 in Manhattan over the next few  years.  So, we're excited about that.  And we have about 42 stores under  development.  So, we're really excited.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  How long does it take to actually bake a pretzel?</p><p>DIZIO:  It takes about seven minutes to bake a pretzel.  Yes, yes.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  Some of these.  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  And some sausage, am I right?</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm digging it.</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.  (INAUDIBLE) This is a new product we had.  It's  our mini hotdog trade.  We've done really well over the years with hotdog  pretzels.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a mini-hotdog stand.  I like that.</p><p>DIZIO:  And we do many hotdogs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fit for a party. </p><p>DIZIO:  That's exactly what it's meant for.  Tailgating parties.  It's been  a big hit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the Republican tax plan, did that impact you as a small  business?</p><p>DIZIO:  It actually did.  I mean, more money for the small businesses.   Remember, our franchisees are business owners and there are small  businesses in communities, and to be able to have a tax break for them,  really lets them reinvest, maybe open another location up, reinvest.  I  mean, these are part of the community, these franchise locations.  I mean,  they sponsored the little league.  They have more money to do these things  and it really does have that effect to help everything in their  communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p>DIZIO:  It's -- we're doing a lot in Midwest, a lot down south.  I mean,  Philadelphia has been haven for pretzels and it is where it all started.   So, we're stretching out, we're in 19 states now and it continues to grow  and people are fascinated and falling in love with the (INAUDIBLE) once we  had --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  These are so good, Maria.  We have to get involved.  These are so  good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan Dizio, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  Thank you.  It's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait, can I have the (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  These are just out of the oven.  Stuart Varney,  over to you.  Do you want to have pretzels?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Delivery, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll have it set up for you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take it away, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  April 26.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m.  on the East Coast.   Earnings in focus on Wall Street.  Futures indicated to open stronger this  morning.  Stocks are expected to be up at the start of trading with Dow up  55, NASDAQ up 42.  Technology bigwigs, Amazon and Microsoft headlining the  biggest earning season of -- earnings day of the season rather.  This is  the single busiest earnings day of the quarter.  Both are due out after the  bell tonight.  We'll be watching those.  General Motors meanwhile beat  expectations last hour.  The stock is under pressure however over the  automaker's high restructuring expenses, stock down two percent.</p><p>Facebook meanwhile, shaking off the scandal.  Shares soaring in the  premarket up almost seven percent after the company beat expectations  yesterday and posted strong growth in daily users.  Take a look at European  indices this morning after the ECB left interest rates unchanged last hour,  the Ft-100 now changed very much.  The CAC quarante is up about a half of a  percent and the DAX Index up a quarter of a percent.  We are waiting on the  ECB President Mario Draghi to start his news conference, that starts in  about 30 minutes and we'll tell you if there's anything else that he says  that might be market moving.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  Shanghai Composite was the worst performer down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump's pick to head the Department  of Veterans Affairs has pulled his name out of consideration.  The details  as Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination in a growing scrutiny from  lawmakers.  And the West Wing, Kanye not backing down from his support of  President Trump.  The Rapper's powerful message to his critics coming up.   A new robot that's more than meets the eye how scientists in Japan created  a real life transformer.  All of those coming up this morning and joining  me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall  Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman along with  Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth.  Great  to see you guys.  </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And great show so far.  We got a lot on the docket.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Sad story about Ronny Jackson.   This guy has really  served his country honorably and well and this is how Washington treats him  on the way out.  Just horrendous.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that is the news of the moment. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know if he's going to remain the doctor at the White  House but really, he didn't deserve this.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Well, it's a way for some people to try and  discourage from anybody serving in the Trump administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  A way to create chaos in President Trump's  administration.  That is the breaking news.  Dr. Ronny Jackson has  withdrawn as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Blake Burman is  live at the White House with all the details right now.  And Blake, the  news just broke about 10 minutes ago.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.  And Ronny Jackson has put out a  statement within the last few minutes here, Maria.  the bottom line with  this was the allegations just continue to pile and pile up against Dr.  Jackson who is the White House doctor had served under President George W.  Bush, President Obama, and now as the personal doctor as well to President  Trump who nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The  allegations were that he was drinking on the job, overprescribing medicine,  fostering a hostile work environment.  </p><p>Jackson had denied all of that but this morning says he does not want to go  forward with this process.  In a statement Jackson says the following,  \"going into the process, I expected tough questions about how to best care  for our veterans but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and  anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.  </p><p>He goes on to say, \"the allegations against me are completely false and  fabricating.  If they had any merit, I would not have been selected,  promoted, and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as  physician to three Presidents over the past 12 years.\"  The White House  throughout all of this over the last few days continues to stand by  Jackson, there was a Press Secretary Sarah Sanders joining the briefing  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Through Jackson's  record as a White House physician has been impeccable.  In fact because Dr.  Jackson has worked within arm's reach of three Presidents, he has received  more vetting than most nominees.  Given this unique position of trust and  responsibility, Dr. Jackson's background and character were evaluated  during three different administrations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  One thing that keep in mind here, Maria, is before all of these  allegations started rolling in and before the folks up on Capitol Hill put  a temporary pause on the nomination process.  There were serious questions  about whether or not Jackson was qualified to handle such a huge  bureaucracy.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, the President during that  news conference with Emmanuel Macron backed Jackson by saying look, this is  his decision to make, he is a qualified to lead this department and we will  find out from Jackson what he decides to do.  This morning, we have found  out he has pulled his name out from the nomination process and now the  White House has yet another open slot to fill, someone to lead the V.A.   Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that is exactly what the left and the resist movement wants  as much chaos as possible around the Trump administration.  Joining us  right now is Gianno Caldwell, we just saw in the moment.  Gianno, thanks  very much for being here this morning.  Fox News Political Analyst,  Republican strategists, Caldwell strategic consulting founder.  Your  reaction to this.  I mean, obviously, this is more -- booby traps in the  Trump administration.  Who leaked all of this or created this around Dr.  Ronny Jackson forcing him to withdraw in your view? </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  We've seen leaks throughout  this entire start of this administration.  And I think it's very  unfortunate.  Further, I think Sarah Sanders said something that was  particularly interesting and I -- and I thought to be very true that Dr.  Ronny Jackson is an individual who's been vetted by three administrations.   So if these were to be true why wasn't that found to be the case in these  other vetting processes?  So it's something that I think that's obviously  harmful to the Trump administration because we've seen nominees put their  name in and have to withdraw.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  So that particularly problematic.  And I'm sad to see him go but  I know that there are some other good people that can step in his place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  I think an excellent candidate with V.P. to be the new V.A.  secretary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, exact -- well, we talked about that earlier, you're  absolutely right.  But I mean, is -- are the people going to -- going to  come forward and make noise about this?  How is this going to stop with all  of these, you know, booby traps and barriers that the resist movement is  putting in place for the Trump administration? </p><p>HEGSETH:  I think your only option in situation like this is to fight back  and fight back ferociously because it isn't just the leaks, it isn't just  the Obama administration.  Do watch other networks --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The media.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They go wall-to-wall on person speculation, anonymously source  with no verification to smear this guy.  I was forced to watch one of these  other networks yesterday for whatever reason and they didn't stop, it was  all Ronny Jackson, all based on nothing.  Gianno, how do you overcome that  in this environment?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know what, I think that's why it's been President Trump's  best quality.  You saw that through the 2015 election where they would  smear him, they would come at him hard and he wouldn't back down.  And I  think that that President Trump is going to people who love and that's the  reason why he actually won the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And we have to see more of that just that we're going to push  back, we're going to push book no matter what you say and how you try to  smear people because these are legitimately good people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all shaming, it's public shaming.  I'll tell you who  is pushing back, Kanye West.  He's calling it the mob.  Let's talk about  his Make America Great moment.  The rapper face backlash for praising  President Trump yesterday posting on Twitter.  Here's what he said, Kanye  West.  You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob cannot make me not  love him.  We are both dragging energy, he is my brother, I love everyone,  I don't agree with everything anyone does.  That's what makes us  individuals and we have the right to independent thought.  Amen to Kanye  West.  Good for him.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Amen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He goes on to -- and then the President actually responded, and  the President tweeted out, thank you, Kanye.  Very cool.  Gianno, your  reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know, it's interesting.  I'm in my hometown at Chicago right  now and of course this is where Kanye is from.  And I'll be talking about  this on largest urban radio station after this interview but this is I  think excellent.  And I'll tell you why I think it's excellent.  Kanye West  has been an individual who's not willing to back down, he's unrelenting in  what he believes.  And I think that the degree, he really appreciates that  in President Trump more than anything.  </p><p>We saw in the 2016 election as I mentioned before, President Trump did not  back down, whatsoever and I wrote a piece about him in the Hill why the  Republican base (INAUDIBLE) it won't break and he read it and sent me a  note.  And in that piece, I said that the Republicans chose him as the guy  that they wanted to win elections because after the media began to attack  him and he was losing business deals, he lost millions saying what he  believes.  </p><p>He didn't step back like most businessmen would, he didn't step back like  most politicians would, he doubled down on it.  And with that being the  case, then says that I'm unapologetic in my view, I'm unapologetic in  American First policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And I'm unapologetic keeping our country safe.  And I think most  people can appreciate that, most people can evaluate that and most people  voted for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gianno though, it's Dagen.  Never forget, Kanye is always about  Kanye.  Kanye is not about -- he is not -- he is not standing up for any  issue quite frankly, he is doing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a shame.  He's pushing back on shaming, calling them  the mob.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I argue that he is doing it for the attention because he knows  that basically siding with President Trump will get him the most attention.   Going after President Obama will get him the most attention.  He isn't  married to the Kardashian clan after all.  Maybe they're learning from him  rather than the other way around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But this also started after the USA communications  director Candace Owens, she hit back at the Democratic Party and she  defend-- she was Fox last night with Martha.  Listen to how she defended  Kanye and what she said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CANDACE OWENS, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Once they inflate our body's  Democratic Party, let's say they haven't slayed our minds, they have told  true who we must love, who we must hate, what we must think, what ideas are  unacceptable.  In the long run, it just -- it just doesn't add up.  Listen,  I think differently, Kanye West thinks differently.  I can guarantee you if  he and I get in the same room, we will have a lot of disagreements.  The  one thing that we will celebrate is our right to think differently.  I  don't understand what's so controversial for the left to understand this.   The way that they had demonized him in the last 72 hours, it's almost  sickening but at the end of the day it's going to have adverse effects.  I  can guarantee you that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well said, Candace.  Gianno, what do you make of all of this?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  I agree with what Candace has said and I'm going to have to push  back on Dagen just a -- just a bit respectfully.  Kanye is about himself,  that's unquestionable.  I know we all realize that.  However, this is an  individual who definitely has gone against ever since I have known him  before he became a national figure.  The marginalization of thought.   Specifically marginalization of who we are as individuals so often as the  society were programmed.  </p><p>I believe to do what's reasonable and what were pretty much taught in  school and I think he goes beyond that and says look, let's look deep  inside ourselves and fulfill our greatest potential.  And generally  speaking when you do that, when you legitimately do that, it's going to  make people uncomfortable and say, hey what you're doing is unreasonable  and maybe you should rethink your decision but generally speaking the  greatest folks we've seen, Mark Zuckerberg, Kanye West, Donald Trump, the  individuals that really succeeded become these megastars are the ones that  go beyond what's public as a final thought.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.  James Freeman here at the Journal.  I'm not sure why  we're talking about Kanye allegedly being all about himself.  I mean, I  don't know -- I don't know what's in his head but the idea that someone  puts out a message that compliments the President, encourages people to  think freely, and says he loves everyone.  Or why are you saying -- well,  he's about himself?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can ask me that question because I'm the one who said it --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- James because he does -- he does and says things to garner  the most attention.  And so being complimentary in this environment,  President Obama is not going to garner him the most attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he has courage by saying it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to --</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's triggering a very important conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- he -- Kanye West has never lacked courage.  I'm not  arguing that.  I'm just saying that there's always a motive and it is about  -- Kanye is not right or left, not Democrat or Republican, Kanye is Kanye  at the end of the day.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  He has an album that's coming out and he loves --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. The album is coming out.</p><p>CALDWELL:  -- due to his compliments in the President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this -- they shame you if you say anything positive about  the President.  You know, you get shamed online if you say anything  positive about the President.  I like to see somebody, who pushes back  because it's wrong.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And he's is breaking the mode on that, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's breaking --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  Because we've got -- we've gone to an extreme point in time  where you can't say anything complimentary about President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Former FBI Director Jim Comey who's been  trashing the President in every interview and he leaked memos, a catalyst  for the special counsel investigation.  That memo was more wildly shared  than we thought initially.  Sources telling Fox News Comey likely gave the  documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another  person along with the with Columbia Law School professor and watch Comey  struggle to defend his actions last night at a CNN town hall.  Listen to  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  You did leak memos, I mean, is it OK for  somebody at the FBI to leak something, an internal document even if it's  not classified?  Isn't that leaking? </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  It was a whole lot wrong with your  question, Anderson.  First, I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to  communicate the substance of one unclassified </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that  it'd be out in media, I wanted it to get in the media.  As a private  citizen, I could do that and did that just as I have written about it in my  book.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does he think just saying this is going to make people think  otherwise?  We're -- we saw what happened.  Gianno, your reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  That is my definition leaking.  He gave information and now,  this is developing at the harvest of the FBI and he gave it to a friend, to  spring this special counsel and if I -- if I recall correctly, I think it  was reported at The Washington -- Wall Street Journal who said after  reading the Comey memos, there is -- they see no reason why there should  have been a special counsel to begin with.  So with that being the case,  Jim Comey definitely is in a position where he's losing all credibility if  he had any left.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget that zero intelligence that was used  to launch the investigation which Devin Nunes told us about.  Gianno, thank  you.  Good to see you.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Good seeing you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive dragnet in Maine after a man shot and  killed a sheriff's deputy.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, John Williams.  They say that the 29-year-old gunned down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine.  That is just  North of Augusta.  Williams drove the cruiser to a nearby convenience store  and he robbed it.  Police releasing this photo, this captured of him from  inside of the stolen car.  He then abandoned that car nearby, he has not  been seen since.  Deputy Cole had been on the force 13 years. He leaves  behind a son.  The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot at  a Dallas Home Depot, one of them was killed there.  Officer Rogelio  Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him  in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest.  22 officers have  been shot and killed so far this year.  That is more than double from the  same time last year and on average, you're not going to believe this, at  least one officer has reportedly been shot to death every week in 2018.  </p><p>Well, earning season is in high gear this morning.  We're just getting  results from a couple of big airlines, you know, and let's start with  American, the stock is trading lower almost 4-1/2 percent to the downside  in the premarket.  Their first quarter revenue just missed the street  estimate.  Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents actually topped  expectations, not helping out though.  Let's take a look at Southwest, they  also are under pressure ahead of the opening bell down more than 3-1/2  percent.  Revenue coming up short of estimates.  Southwest did add -- the  bookings are down after an engine on its one planes exploded last week  killing a passenger and that was Southwest's first fatality in the  carrier's history.  </p><p>And then finally there's this.  You want to be careful, the next car that  you hop in to might be Megatron.  Japanese engineers created a real life  Transformer that can actually carry people onboard.  This is the first  scene we've ever seen anything like this.  It's a robot car.  It walks over  18 miles an hour and transforms into a sports car with people still inside.   The robot creator says he was yes inspired by his childhood Transformer  heroes that he watched in the movies in growing up.  There you have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, very cool.</p><p>CASONE:  Very cool.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  The outlook on trade with China, big delegation  going next week.  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers will weigh in on the  new report that Chinese companies are already reconsidering investments in  the American market as Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary gets set to  visit his counterpart in China next week.  Then founding partner of  AlphaOne Capital Partners Dan Niles joins me to talk about Facebook's  quarterly results, he predicted the company would beat.  I'll get his take  on the company's surging revenue and where it goes next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Focus on Facebook.  The social media company  beat earnings and revenue expectations last night despite the fallout from  the privacy scandal.  Yesterday, Facebook reported adjusted earnings per  share of $1.69 on revenue of $11.97 billion.  That was the first quarter of  2018.  Shares of Facebook right now are up seven percent in the premarket.   Joining us right now on the telephone is the founding partner of AlphaOne  Capital Partners, Dan Niles.  One of his big positions is Facebook.  And  Dan, good to have you.  Thanks very much for weighing in here.  You  predicted that the company would beat revenue and earnings expectations.   What's your take away from the numbers?</p><p>DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDING PARTNER (via telephone):  I  mean, quite honestly, it's even better than what I was expecting.  You have  to look at the revenues first and revenues year-over-year in the June  quarter were up 45 percent.  And the September and December quarters,  accelerated up 47 percent.  And what's interesting is even with all the  negative publicity around the supposed data scandal, the revenues  accelerates 50 percent year over year in (INAUDIBLE) they keep the  operating income by about 14 percent where their margins were better than  expected and they keep the ETF by over 20 percent.  I mean, back out some  of the one time.  So it's really hard to find a whole lot negative in the  report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about expenses going forward in this whole regulatory  scrutiny?  I mean, are we going to see, you know, new rules regulations  that this company is going to have to adhere to in the entire industry,  we'll have to adhere to that will change the reason to own the stock  because expenses are higher?</p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I really don't think so.  I mean, here is a way to think  about it.  Even though expenses they guided to up 50 to 60 percent,  originally they guided up 45 to 60.  Estimates are actually going up after  this print because they beat the operating income margins by so much that  even though their guiding expenses higher most of the street is actually  raising EPS.  </p><p>The second thing is, I'm sure there will be some extra regulations they  need to adhere to, obviously they talk on the call about the general  protection regulations coming out on May 25th in Europe but the interesting  thing as they said, even with those regulations, they don't anticipate  those changes really significantly impacting our revenue, they do think  daily active users could be cracked down in the second quarter but, you  know, that's really not affecting the revenues.  </p><p>And quite honestly the extra regulations with them, it will -- it will help  make their site a lot safer and to some extent it's going to impact their  smaller competitors a lot more.  They don't have same resources as Facebook  to comply with that. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Hi, Dan.  James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal.  I'd like to  talk about those potential smaller competitors.  Normally those kind of fat  profit margins attract competition.  Who is it that can challenge Facebook,  either among startups or existing tech giants moving into their business. </p><p>NILES:  Well, I mean, you obviously know the list of characters, you've got  Twitter, you've got Snapchat obviously, two public companies talked about  most often.  But I mean, they've been competing since the beginning and  you've obviously seen this market is, you know, not necessarily winner take  post but it's sort evolving that way as Facebook continues to execute and  they're executing really across all of the metrics.  So it's not just  growing revenue but they're highly, highly profitable.  </p><p>They have 46 percent operating marks. And so -- and you have to remember,  to some extent they are a startup in different businesses, so we talked  about Facebook, they've got 2.2 billion users and Instagram 800 million  users, so that's great.  What we don't talk about that much is the 1.3  billion users for Facebook messenger is that they just started to make  money off of and they make absolutely no money off of the 1.5 billion  WhatsApp users.  </p><p>So they've got -- to some extent two startups buried within the company  between Messenger and WhatsApp that they still haven't really started to  monetize yet and that gives me a lot of comfort especially when you look at  the multiples of trading at 20 times non-gap, you know, under 18 earnings.   Markets up 17.  These are growing the top line at 50 percent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The world is wash in venture capital.  Are new competitors being  funded?  And if not, why not?  Is Facebook seen as so dominate that that  won't work? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, I think people are trying to work around the edges  but you have to remember with Facebook, there is something pretty unique  which is the network effect.  You're not going to get off of Facebook and  go to Google plus if your friends aren't there.  So, you can't really  easily switch.  If you're dealing with Google for example and somebody came  out with a much better search engine, you know, there's nothing to stop you  from going to the other one, the problem with this is that even if somebody  didn't develop a great other alternative social media site, you're not  going to move unless all of your friends move too.  And that's probably not  going to happen immediately.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan, real quick.  Intel and Microsoft after the bell tonight,  good quarters?  What are you expecting? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, Intel is one of our largest positions.  We like it  quite a bit.  I think the real key for Intel is enterprise demand has been  really bad for the last couple years.  That really started to improve in  the fourth quarter and I think it's going to be very good for this year.   So we like Intel a lot and it's got a low multiple as well in this  environment at about 14 times.  So we like that quite a bit and Microsoft,  similarly we think they should have a pretty solid quarter.  A multiple is  quite a bit higher at 24 times, so not as preferred to us as Intel. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Dan, always great to talk  with you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>NILES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Dan Niles joining us there.  AlphaOne  Capital.  Coming up.  House Republican Conference chair and Washington  Congressman Cathy McMorris Rogders joins me next. We'll get her take on  French President Macron's state visit with President Trump, trade, and a  lot more.  Then a new twist on coffee just in time for summer.  Starbucks  introducing cold foam before reporting earnings after the bell tonight.  We  break down the expectations.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first-quarter earnings, General Motors and Pepsico among  the companies reporting their first-quarter this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations, while PepsiCo was mixed.  Both stocks are under some selling  pressure this morning by a fraction.  Investors are waiting on big tech.   Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all reporting, after the close tonight, all the  stocks are trading up about two percent right now.  </p><p>Broader markets this morning are higher.  March durable goods just came out  up 2.6 percent versus an estimate of 1.6 percent that was better than  expected.  The news is a positive for markets, and we are seeing a pretty  good tone today.  The Dow Industrials set to open about 50 points, that's a  quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up a third of a percent right now.  And the NASDAQ up 50 points,  that's three-quarters of one percent.  The Dow yesterday snapped a five-day  losing streak.  And the momentum continues today.  That was lifted by  Boeing's big earnings beat.  Boeing's stock did well as did the Dow up 60  points at the close, a quarter of a percent higher.  The S&amp;P was also  fractionally better on the day.  The NASDAQ yesterday, closed lower by  three points.  </p><p>In Europe, this morning, the major indices are higher.  The European  Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, and Mario Draghi is about to  speak in his press conference.  FT-100 up 7-1/2, CAC Quarante up 35, that's  two-thirds of a percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a  percent, 43 points higher.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>President Trump lashing out against Jim Comey.  He's targeting the former  FBI Director on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago.  We will tell you what the  President just told our colleagues there.  And breaking news this morning,  Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination as Secretary of Veterans  Affairs.  President Trump weighed in on the announcement earlier this hour  on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" he placed the blame squarely on Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I even told them a day or  two ago.  I saw this was -- where this was going.  And you know they're  very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again first in his class at West  Point, top in class at Harvard Law School, a brilliant guy, a great guy,  and somebody I get along with very well.  You know, Mike got through and  they thought they had him stopped.  The Democrats are obstructionists.   It's horrible what they're doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Capitol Hill coming up this morning.  And then  just in time for summer, Starbucks added -- adds cold foam.  The details  ahead of the company's earnings report later this hour.  The stock is up,  half of a percent.  Plus, it is National Pretzel Day.  We are celebrating  pretzel day here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Wait until you see this pretzel  that they made of my face.  I don't -- I don't think it looks like me but  let me see if I can grab this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is Pretzel Day.  There you go.  OK, we'll get to that coming  up this morning, but first, our top story right now, President Trump  lashing out at Jim Comey, this morning.  Here's what he had to say about  the fired FBI Director in a new interview this morning with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\"  moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Comey is a leaker and he's a liar.  And not only on this stuff,  he's been leaking for years.  He's probably been using his friend, the so- called professor, who now turns out to have FBI clearance which he never  said.  He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress, he  said he gave it to a friend.  And he gave it to a friend to leak classified  information.  It is all classified, it was totally classified.  So, he  illegally -- he did an illegal act, and he said it himself, in order to get  a special counsel against me. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is House Republican Conference Chair and  Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Good to see you,  Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p>REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R), WASHINGTON, CHAIR, HOUSE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this.  You know, I was actually really struck  by the interview last night that Comey did with CNN, and basically he said,  no, I didn't leak anything but then went on to talk about how, in fact, he  did leak these memos that he wrote which as soon as an FBI Director writes  a memo in FBI, you know, headquarters, that is the property of the FBI, but  he said he passed it on to his friend and told his friend, oh, just get  this to the New York Times but don't actually give them the paper, and he  said that's not leaking.  Your reaction.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, it's -- yes, it begs a lot of questions.  And in someone  who believes it's so important that we are restoring trust, that we're  restoring the rule of law in this country, the FBI is the highest law  enforcement agency.  This is -- the people within the FBI must be held to  the highest standards, and that is what causes me so much dismay right now  is just the cloud that is over the FBI, and the questions that it has  raised.  We need the men and women there to act in the utmost authority, as  well as transparency and accountability to the American people.  And so,  yes, he clearly leaked, and it raises a lot of questions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is there going to be any accountability here,  Congresswoman?  I mean, look, last weekend, I had your colleague,  Congressman Devin Nunes on my Sunday morning program and he said, after  looking at all the electronic communications, he realized that there was no  intelligence used to actually launch an investigation into the Trump  campaign.  So, what happens now?  I mean, can we just keep seeing, you  know, people at the top of these important agencies abuse their power with  no accountability?</p><p>RODGERS:  No one is above the law and they must be held accountable.  And  that's the role of Congress, that's the role of the elected representatives  of the people within the House to make sure that we are taking action to  hold them accountable.  So, both in the Intelligence Committee as well as  the government oversight and reform committee which Trey Gowdy is the  chairman of, that's where these questions are asked and that's where  there's been frustration, that documents have not been turned over, that  people have not been as forthright in answering the questions, but it is up  to us to make sure that people are held accountable and that no one is  above the law. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, we'll be watching what develops then.  Then  there is this, the breaking news this breaking news this morning,  Congresswoman, and that is Dr. Ronny Jackson withdrawing his name for  consideration for the head of the V.A., President Trump's pick to lead the  Department of Veterans Affairs pulled his nomination in the last hour amid  all of these questions surrounding his professional conduct.   Congresswoman, your reaction to this news?</p><p>RODGERS:  I respect his decision.  It's most important that we get someone  at the V.A.  Again, we need to restore trust between the veterans and this  agency whose mission is to serve our veterans.  And as someone who  represents nearly 70,000 veterans in eastern Washington, I hear regularly  from veterans who feel like when they contact the V.A. that they're more of  a burden than actually having the red carpet rolled out for them.  So, we  need someone to head up the V.A., we need to get focused on the mission of  the V.A., and make sure that our veterans, those who have served are  getting the care that they need when the time comes, that has to be a top  priority for us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean, can we just ignore all of the barriers and the  booby traps that the left is putting in place for the Trump administration?   I mean, look at all of the positions that are yet unfilled.  Look at all of  the slow walking going on in terms of getting his nominees passed.  You  know, Mike Pompeo got -- you know, got support, but it was close.  I mean,  what about that, who is doing this?  We know that three administrations  have said how great Dr. Ronny Jackson is and all of a sudden, somebody  leaks all of this speculation about his personal life.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, that is -- yes, that's tough to see, and I respect his  decision just to pull out.  I am concerned that the left is putting  politics ahead of what's best for the country, and there's so many --  there's the V.A. position, Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, he's an  honorable man, a well-respected leader, he's proven himself, and yet too  many were willing to put politics ahead of what was best for the country.   We do need to get these people in place because that is part of making sure  that President Trump has the people around him to actually lead, and people  equal policy and he needs these people in place so that we can keep moving  forward.  There's a lot on our plate right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think people are figuring this out, that there's -- all of  these booby traps that are being put in by the skeptics and critics of  President Trump.  And then there's China, of course, reportedly threatening  to \"fierce counterstrike\" if the President goes ahead with these another  $100 billion in tariffs as punishment for the alleged intellectual property  theft.  Congressman, your thoughts on this.  I know Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary and a whole delegation are going next week to meet with  their counterparts in China to talk this out.</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, there's too many examples of illegal practices by  China, where we have seen them taking our intellectual property and  duplicating it.  I have examples in Eastern Washington, Washington State,  and it destroys companies here in America.  I am encouraged that President  Trump is focused on making sure that we hold China accountable.  I have had  concerns about the across-the-board approach to tariffs that, you know, he  was talking about imposing upon steel and aluminum.  I do believe it needs  to be more targeted but we must hold a country like China accountable for  illegal practices or free and fair trade will never work. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bottom line, do you think that the President with his tough  talk and the team is going to be able to account that budget deficit with  China, which is already now up to 375 billion?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, if anyone can do it, I believe it's President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes,</p><p>RODGERS:  And he is focused on this.  I had the chance to spend some time  with Larry Kudlow just last week.  I'm really pleased to see him as the  head of the economic advisors, his chief economic adviser.  He understands  economics, world trade, and also what's going on in China.  And he  basically told us everything is on the table, tariffs, no tariffs,  sanctions, but we must hold them accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's going to be on that trip as well, Larry Kudlow, and  Peter Navarro.  What about this budget about face, Congresswoman?   President Trump is now urging lawmakers to rescind some of the spending of  that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill which he signed last month.   Congresswoman, are there enough votes to make it happen and obviously you  must be getting just as much pushback as so many others are, for signing  that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill with all the spending?</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, we must address the spending in this country.  It  is the number one threat that faces us, both from a military perspective as  well as economic perspective, we needed to get a budget in place, but it  spends too much, and that's where I am -- I'm actually encouraged that the  President, Mick Mulvaney is leading on putting together a rescission  package.  </p><p>We should have been doing this all along, really taking a look at those  opportunities to go into programs, go into agencies and actually through  the House and the Senate, cut the spending.  The budget process is broken,  the House passed all 12 of our appropriations bills.  We went through  program by program, agency by agency, the Senate did zero.  So, this has  been very frustrating.  </p><p>This is our fundamental job as the elected representatives, this is where  we exercise the power of the purse, and yet this process is broken.  So, I  am -- I definitely want to look at what the President -- what they can  propose.  I think the House and Senate should also be using this tool of  rescissions to take action that we can to reduce those deficits and reduce  the debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his three-day  state visit with an address to the joint meeting of Congress.  How was it,  what was your takeaway?  He was critical of the President's planned  withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, I think, it is important that these conversations continue.   I've never been a supporter of the Iran deal.  I thought it was bad deal.   It did not hold Iran accountable for not developing or obtaining nuclear  weapons.  And that's where we need our European allies to join us in making  sure that we have a deal that is going to accomplish the goal of ensuring  that they do not develop nuclear weapons.  And right now, we do not have  that confidence. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, real quick, who are you supporting for Speaker of  the House?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, you know, I -- we need to make sure that we are voting on a  Republican speaker after the elections, so we need to stay focused on the  policy and on our midterms and making sure that we're getting that done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Thanks so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ford Motor now pulling all but two of its  passenger cars from its North American line up as part of a plan to save  money and make the company more competitive.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  Stu, a car company canceling all of its  cars?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Well, you know, if you can't make money  selling cars, I guess you forget about selling cars, and you go to light  trucks and SUVs because that's where the money is.  It's a perfectly  rational move but boy, does it come as a shock.  You know, when I think of  the Ford Motor company, I think of the Taurus, one of the best-selling  marks for almost a generation.  It's gone.  They're not going to sell that  thing in North America any longer.  The Fiesta is going.  A couple of other  marks, I guess you'd call them, are going.  I was just shocked to hear  that.  It's a car company, but it's not a car company.  It's now a light  truck and SUV company because it wants to make some more money.  Look at  the stock, up 2-1/2 percent, just because its walking away from the car  market.  I wondered if General Motors will do something similar or FiatChrysler, walk away from unprofitable lines because you got to make money  in this environment and that's what you got to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really fascinating.</p><p>VARNEY:  I find it fascinating, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is -- it is fascinating.  And remember the last CEO wanted  to make it a mobility company.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  My, how times change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  I know you'll have a  lot more on it.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Sure, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart.  It is the busiest day of  the earnings season today, G.M. one of the big names out this morning.   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the  numbers.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The busiest day  of 68 S&amp;P 500 companies, and to your point, your chat with Stuart, guess  what, G.M. is doing much of the same, focusing on a highly-profitable  pickup trucks, and that's what's costing them going forward for 2018.  So,  for the quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line.  Profit was on  the rise, and it's the high-margin vehicles that they're going to be  working on.  So, 2018, they expect that they will have flat profits but  expect the all new pickup trucks would boost the margins in 2019.  The  stock is down a half of one percent.  </p><p>Then, let's take a look at Starbucks.  So, we're expecting for Starbucks to  report after the bell today.  Global same-store sales are likely on the  rise to the tune of about 1.8 percent.  They still, obviously or have the  P.R. that they have to deal with from Philadelphia, removing those two  black men, but big spot is China.  That's where they see the growth.  In  fact, they're opening one new store in China every 15 hours.  And also, you  can get cold foam on your new -- on your new Starbucks.  All right, Dagen,  back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  So, coming up, it's not your average  day.  We are celebrating National Pretzel Day.  Maria's pretzel with a  small business is growing fast.  We take you live to plaza, where there is  a pretzel truck waiting.  I've already eaten one, they're delicious.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you outside on the plaza,  outside headquarters.  What a twist in this National Pretzel Day.  We are  celebrating in style with a small business that is growing fast.  Joining  me right now is Dan Dizio, he's the CEO and co-founder of Philly Pretzel  Factory and we've got the team here ready to munch on all pretzels.  Dan,  great to see you.  </p><p>DAN DIZIO, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY:  Me, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, and I love the MORNINGS WITH  MARIA in pretzel.  That is very cool, nice touch.  You've been selling  pretzels since you're 11 on the corner in Philadelphia.  Tell us how you  started your business.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, my next door neighbor had a pretzel bakery, got stuck with a  bunch of pretzels.  I'm 47 now.  This week, I'll be 47.  And he got stuck.   A woman asked if I would sell them on the shoe corner and we would split  the money.  And my mom said it would be OK.  He had to ask my mom  permission, and, for some reasons, my mom said it would be OK to stand on  the street corner all day (INAUDIBLE) but she said it was a different time  back then.  So -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  And, yes, I did it, and did real well, and the next thing I know  every guy was selling pretzels, and did all through middle school and high  school.  And I went to college and was a graduate, and had a stockbroker  job and just didn't like the 9:00 to 5:00 thing, and I want to get back to  the pretzel business and I talked my college roommate into doing a pretzel  business and that's how it started, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You started with the food truck, the Philly Pretzel Factory,  you've got the food truck -- Hi, everybody.  Did you have a pretzel?  Tell  me about the food truck business because this is a really successful way to  sell.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we've had the truck for a few years now.  We're really doing  well with the weddings, bar mitzvahs, just different event.  I mean,  there's different places we could take it, so it'd be mobile.  That's the  way you have to be in this moment right now as for -- be able to  (INAUDIBLE) and be able to bring the pretzel to the people where they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, you have 170 locations across the country.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're opening more stores.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we're actually opening up 25 in New York right now.  We just  did area development deal to open up 25 in Manhattan over the next few  years.  So, we're excited about that.  And we have about 42 stores under  development.  So, we're really excited.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  How long does it take to actually bake a pretzel?</p><p>DIZIO:  It takes about seven minutes to bake a pretzel.  Yes, yes.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  Some of these.  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  And some sausage, am I right?</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm digging it.</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.  (INAUDIBLE) This is a new product we had.  It's  our mini hotdog trade.  We've done really well over the years with hotdog  pretzels.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a mini-hotdog stand.  I like that.</p><p>DIZIO:  And we do many hotdogs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fit for a party. </p><p>DIZIO:  That's exactly what it's meant for.  Tailgating parties.  It's been  a big hit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the Republican tax plan, did that impact you as a small  business?</p><p>DIZIO:  It actually did.  I mean, more money for the small businesses.   Remember, our franchisees are business owners and there are small  businesses in communities, and to be able to have a tax break for them,  really lets them reinvest, maybe open another location up, reinvest.  I  mean, these are part of the community, these franchise locations.  I mean,  they sponsored the little league.  They have more money to do these things  and it really does have that effect to help everything in their  communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p>DIZIO:  It's -- we're doing a lot in Midwest, a lot down south.  I mean,  Philadelphia has been haven for pretzels and it is where it all started.   So, we're stretching out, we're in 19 states now and it continues to grow  and people are fascinated and falling in love with the (INAUDIBLE) once we  had --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  These are so good, Maria.  We have to get involved.  These are so  good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan Dizio, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  Thank you.  It's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait, can I have the (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  These are just out of the oven.  Stuart Varney,  over to you.  Do you want to have pretzels?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Delivery, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll have it set up for you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take it away, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  April 26.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m.  on the East Coast.   Earnings in focus on Wall Street.  Futures indicated to open stronger this  morning.  Stocks are expected to be up at the start of trading with Dow up  55, NASDAQ up 42.  Technology bigwigs, Amazon and Microsoft headlining the  biggest earning season of -- earnings day of the season rather.  This is  the single busiest earnings day of the quarter.  Both are due out after the  bell tonight.  We'll be watching those.  General Motors meanwhile beat  expectations last hour.  The stock is under pressure however over the  automaker's high restructuring expenses, stock down two percent.</p><p>Facebook meanwhile, shaking off the scandal.

Take a look at European  indices this morning after the ECB left interest rates unchanged last hour,  the Ft-100 now changed very much.  The CAC quarante is up about a half of a  percent and the DAX Index up a quarter of a percent.  We are waiting on the  ECB President Mario Draghi to start his news conference, that starts in  about 30 minutes and we'll tell you if there's anything else that he says  that might be market moving.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  Shanghai Composite was the worst performer down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump's pick to head the Department  of Veterans Affairs has pulled his name out of consideration.  The details  as Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination in a growing scrutiny from  lawmakers.  And the West Wing, Kanye not backing down from his support of  President Trump.  The Rapper's powerful message to his critics coming up.   A new robot that's more than meets the eye how scientists in Japan created  a real life transformer.  All of those coming up this morning and joining  me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall  Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman along with  Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth.  Great  to see you guys.  </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And great show so far.  We got a lot on the docket.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Sad story about Ronny Jackson.   This guy has really  served his country honorably and well and this is how Washington treats him  on the way out.  Just horrendous.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that is the news of the moment. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know if he's going to remain the doctor at the White  House but really, he didn't deserve this.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Well, it's a way for some people to try and  discourage from anybody serving in the Trump administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  A way to create chaos in President Trump's  administration.  That is the breaking news.  Dr. Ronny Jackson has  withdrawn as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Blake Burman is  live at the White House with all the details right now.  And Blake, the  news just broke about 10 minutes ago.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.  And Ronny Jackson has put out a  statement within the last few minutes here, Maria.  the bottom line with  this was the allegations just continue to pile and pile up against Dr.  Jackson who is the White House doctor had served under President George W.  Bush, President Obama, and now as the personal doctor as well to President  Trump who nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The  allegations were that he was drinking on the job, overprescribing medicine,  fostering a hostile work environment.  </p><p>Jackson had denied all of that but this morning says he does not want to go  forward with this process.  In a statement Jackson says the following,  \"going into the process, I expected tough questions about how to best care  for our veterans but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and  anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.  </p><p>He goes on to say, \"the allegations against me are completely false and  fabricating.  If they had any merit, I would not have been selected,  promoted, and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as  physician to three Presidents over the past 12 years.\"  The White House  throughout all of this over the last few days continues to stand by  Jackson, there was a Press Secretary Sarah Sanders joining the briefing  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Through Jackson's  record as a White House physician has been impeccable.  In fact because Dr.  Jackson has worked within arm's reach of three Presidents, he has received  more vetting than most nominees.  Given this unique position of trust and  responsibility, Dr. Jackson's background and character were evaluated  during three different administrations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  One thing that keep in mind here, Maria, is before all of these  allegations started rolling in and before the folks up on Capitol Hill put  a temporary pause on the nomination process.  There were serious questions  about whether or not Jackson was qualified to handle such a huge  bureaucracy.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, the President during that  news conference with Emmanuel Macron backed Jackson by saying look, this is  his decision to make, he is a qualified to lead this department and we will  find out from Jackson what he decides to do.  This morning, we have found  out he has pulled his name out from the nomination process and now the  White House has yet another open slot to fill, someone to lead the V.A.   Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that is exactly what the left and the resist movement wants  as much chaos as possible around the Trump administration.  Joining us  right now is Gianno Caldwell, we just saw in the moment.  Gianno, thanks  very much for being here this morning.  Fox News Political Analyst,  Republican strategists, Caldwell strategic consulting founder.  Your  reaction to this.  I mean, obviously, this is more -- booby traps in the  Trump administration.  Who leaked all of this or created this around Dr.  Ronny Jackson forcing him to withdraw in your view? </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  We've seen leaks throughout  this entire start of this administration.  And I think it's very  unfortunate.  Further, I think Sarah Sanders said something that was  particularly interesting and I -- and I thought to be very true that Dr.  Ronny Jackson is an individual who's been vetted by three administrations.   So if these were to be true why wasn't that found to be the case in these  other vetting processes?  So it's something that I think that's obviously  harmful to the Trump administration because we've seen nominees put their  name in and have to withdraw.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  So that particularly problematic.  And I'm sad to see him go but  I know that there are some other good people that can step in his place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  I think an excellent candidate with V.P. to be the new V.A.  secretary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, exact -- well, we talked about that earlier, you're  absolutely right.  But I mean, is -- are the people going to -- going to  come forward and make noise about this?  How is this going to stop with all  of these, you know, booby traps and barriers that the resist movement is  putting in place for the Trump administration? </p><p>HEGSETH:  I think your only option in situation like this is to fight back  and fight back ferociously because it isn't just the leaks, it isn't just  the Obama administration.  Do watch other networks --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The media.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They go wall-to-wall on person speculation, anonymously source  with no verification to smear this guy.  I was forced to watch one of these  other networks yesterday for whatever reason and they didn't stop, it was  all Ronny Jackson, all based on nothing.  Gianno, how do you overcome that  in this environment?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know what, I think that's why it's been President Trump's  best quality.  You saw that through the 2015 election where they would  smear him, they would come at him hard and he wouldn't back down.  And I  think that that President Trump is going to people who love and that's the  reason why he actually won the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And we have to see more of that just that we're going to push  back, we're going to push book no matter what you say and how you try to  smear people because these are legitimately good people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all shaming, it's public shaming.  I'll tell you who  is pushing back, Kanye West.  He's calling it the mob.  Let's talk about  his Make America Great moment.  The rapper face backlash for praising  President Trump yesterday posting on Twitter.  Here's what he said, Kanye  West.  You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob cannot make me not  love him.  We are both dragging energy, he is my brother, I love everyone,  I don't agree with everything anyone does.  That's what makes us  individuals and we have the right to independent thought.  Amen to Kanye  West.  Good for him.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Amen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He goes on to -- and then the President actually responded, and  the President tweeted out, thank you, Kanye.  Very cool.  Gianno, your  reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know, it's interesting.  I'm in my hometown at Chicago right  now and of course this is where Kanye is from.  And I'll be talking about  this on largest urban radio station after this interview but this is I  think excellent.  And I'll tell you why I think it's excellent.  Kanye West  has been an individual who's not willing to back down, he's unrelenting in  what he believes.  And I think that the degree, he really appreciates that  in President Trump more than anything.  </p><p>We saw in the 2016 election as I mentioned before, President Trump did not  back down, whatsoever and I wrote a piece about him in the Hill why the  Republican base (INAUDIBLE) it won't break and he read it and sent me a  note.  And in that piece, I said that the Republicans chose him as the guy  that they wanted to win elections because after the media began to attack  him and he was losing business deals, he lost millions saying what he  believes.  </p><p>He didn't step back like most businessmen would, he didn't step back like  most politicians would, he doubled down on it.  And with that being the  case, then says that I'm unapologetic in my view, I'm unapologetic in  American First policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And I'm unapologetic keeping our country safe.  And I think most  people can appreciate that, most people can evaluate that and most people  voted for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gianno though, it's Dagen.  Never forget, Kanye is always about  Kanye.  Kanye is not about -- he is not -- he is not standing up for any  issue quite frankly, he is doing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a shame.  He's pushing back on shaming, calling them  the mob.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I argue that he is doing it for the attention because he knows  that basically siding with President Trump will get him the most attention.   Going after President Obama will get him the most attention.  He isn't  married to the Kardashian clan after all.  Maybe they're learning from him  rather than the other way around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But this also started after the USA communications  director Candace Owens, she hit back at the Democratic Party and she  defend-- she was Fox last night with Martha.  Listen to how she defended  Kanye and what she said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CANDACE OWENS, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Once they inflate our body's  Democratic Party, let's say they haven't slayed our minds, they have told  true who we must love, who we must hate, what we must think, what ideas are  unacceptable.  In the long run, it just -- it just doesn't add up.  Listen,  I think differently, Kanye West thinks differently.  I can guarantee you if  he and I get in the same room, we will have a lot of disagreements.  The  one thing that we will celebrate is our right to think differently.  I  don't understand what's so controversial for the left to understand this.   The way that they had demonized him in the last 72 hours, it's almost  sickening but at the end of the day it's going to have adverse effects.  I  can guarantee you that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well said, Candace.  Gianno, what do you make of all of this?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  I agree with what Candace has said and I'm going to have to push  back on Dagen just a -- just a bit respectfully.  Kanye is about himself,  that's unquestionable.  I know we all realize that.  However, this is an  individual who definitely has gone against ever since I have known him  before he became a national figure.  The marginalization of thought.   Specifically marginalization of who we are as individuals so often as the  society were programmed.  </p><p>I believe to do what's reasonable and what were pretty much taught in  school and I think he goes beyond that and says look, let's look deep  inside ourselves and fulfill our greatest potential.  And generally  speaking when you do that, when you legitimately do that, it's going to  make people uncomfortable and say, hey what you're doing is unreasonable  and maybe you should rethink your decision but generally speaking the  greatest folks we've seen, Mark Zuckerberg, Kanye West, Donald Trump, the  individuals that really succeeded become these megastars are the ones that  go beyond what's public as a final thought.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.  James Freeman here at the Journal.  I'm not sure why  we're talking about Kanye allegedly being all about himself.  I mean, I  don't know -- I don't know what's in his head but the idea that someone  puts out a message that compliments the President, encourages people to  think freely, and says he loves everyone.  Or why are you saying -- well,  he's about himself?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can ask me that question because I'm the one who said it --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- James because he does -- he does and says things to garner  the most attention.  And so being complimentary in this environment,  President Obama is not going to garner him the most attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he has courage by saying it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to --</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's triggering a very important conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- he -- Kanye West has never lacked courage.  I'm not  arguing that.  I'm just saying that there's always a motive and it is about  -- Kanye is not right or left, not Democrat or Republican, Kanye is Kanye  at the end of the day.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  He has an album that's coming out and he loves --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. The album is coming out.</p><p>CALDWELL:  -- due to his compliments in the President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this -- they shame you if you say anything positive about  the President.  You know, you get shamed online if you say anything  positive about the President.  I like to see somebody, who pushes back  because it's wrong.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And he's is breaking the mode on that, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's breaking --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  Because we've got -- we've gone to an extreme point in time  where you can't say anything complimentary about President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Former FBI Director Jim Comey who's been  trashing the President in every interview and he leaked memos, a catalyst  for the special counsel investigation.  That memo was more wildly shared  than we thought initially.  Sources telling Fox News Comey likely gave the  documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another  person along with the with Columbia Law School professor and watch Comey  struggle to defend his actions last night at a CNN town hall.  Listen to  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  You did leak memos, I mean, is it OK for  somebody at the FBI to leak something, an internal document even if it's  not classified?  Isn't that leaking? </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  It was a whole lot wrong with your  question, Anderson.  First, I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to  communicate the substance of one unclassified </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that  it'd be out in media, I wanted it to get in the media.  As a private  citizen, I could do that and did that just as I have written about it in my  book.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does he think just saying this is going to make people think  otherwise?  We're -- we saw what happened.  Gianno, your reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  That is my definition leaking.  He gave information and now,  this is developing at the harvest of the FBI and he gave it to a friend, to  spring this special counsel and if I -- if I recall correctly, I think it  was reported at The Washington -- Wall Street Journal who said after  reading the Comey memos, there is -- they see no reason why there should  have been a special counsel to begin with.  So with that being the case,  Jim Comey definitely is in a position where he's losing all credibility if  he had any left.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget that zero intelligence that was used  to launch the investigation which Devin Nunes told us about.  Gianno, thank  you.  Good to see you.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Good seeing you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive dragnet in Maine after a man shot and  killed a sheriff's deputy.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, John Williams.  They say that the 29-year-old gunned down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine.  That is just  North of Augusta.  Williams drove the cruiser to a nearby convenience store  and he robbed it.  Police releasing this photo, this captured of him from  inside of the stolen car.  He then abandoned that car nearby, he has not  been seen since.  Deputy Cole had been on the force 13 years. He leaves  behind a son.  The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot at  a Dallas Home Depot, one of them was killed there.  Officer Rogelio  Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him  in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest.  22 officers have  been shot and killed so far this year.  That is more than double from the  same time last year and on average, you're not going to believe this, at  least one officer has reportedly been shot to death every week in 2018.  </p><p>Well, earning season is in high gear this morning.  We're just getting  results from a couple of big airlines, you know, and let's start with  American, the stock is trading lower almost 4-1/2 percent to the downside  in the premarket.  Their first quarter revenue just missed the street  estimate.  Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents actually topped  expectations, not helping out though.  Let's take a look at Southwest, they  also are under pressure ahead of the opening bell down more than 3-1/2  percent.  Revenue coming up short of estimates.  Southwest did add -- the  bookings are down after an engine on its one planes exploded last week  killing a passenger and that was Southwest's first fatality in the  carrier's history.  </p><p>And then finally there's this.  You want to be careful, the next car that  you hop in to might be Megatron.  Japanese engineers created a real life  Transformer that can actually carry people onboard.  This is the first  scene we've ever seen anything like this.  It's a robot car.  It walks over  18 miles an hour and transforms into a sports car with people still inside.   The robot creator says he was yes inspired by his childhood Transformer  heroes that he watched in the movies in growing up.  There you have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, very cool.</p><p>CASONE:  Very cool.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  The outlook on trade with China, big delegation  going next week.  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers will weigh in on the  new report that Chinese companies are already reconsidering investments in  the American market as Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary gets set to  visit his counterpart in China next week.  Then founding partner of  AlphaOne Capital Partners Dan Niles joins me to talk about Facebook's  quarterly results, he predicted the company would beat.  I'll get his take  on the company's surging revenue and where it goes next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Focus on Facebook.  The social media company  beat earnings and revenue expectations last night despite the fallout from  the privacy scandal.  Yesterday, Facebook reported adjusted earnings per  share of $1.69 on revenue of $11.97 billion.  That was the first quarter of  2018.  Shares of Facebook right now are up seven percent in the premarket.   Joining us right now on the telephone is the founding partner of AlphaOne  Capital Partners, Dan Niles.  One of his big positions is Facebook.  And  Dan, good to have you.  Thanks very much for weighing in here.  You  predicted that the company would beat revenue and earnings expectations.   What's your take away from the numbers?</p><p>DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDING PARTNER (via telephone):  I  mean, quite honestly, it's even better than what I was expecting.  You have  to look at the revenues first and revenues year-over-year in the June  quarter were up 45 percent.  And the September and December quarters,  accelerated up 47 percent.  And what's interesting is even with all the  negative publicity around the supposed data scandal, the revenues  accelerates 50 percent year over year in (INAUDIBLE) they keep the  operating income by about 14 percent where their margins were better than  expected and they keep the ETF by over 20 percent.  I mean, back out some  of the one time.  So it's really hard to find a whole lot negative in the  report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about expenses going forward in this whole regulatory  scrutiny?  I mean, are we going to see, you know, new rules regulations  that this company is going to have to adhere to in the entire industry,  we'll have to adhere to that will change the reason to own the stock  because expenses are higher?</p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I really don't think so.  I mean, here is a way to think  about it.  Even though expenses they guided to up 50 to 60 percent,  originally they guided up 45 to 60.  Estimates are actually going up after  this print because they beat the operating income margins by so much that  even though their guiding expenses higher most of the street is actually  raising EPS.  </p><p>The second thing is, I'm sure there will be some extra regulations they  need to adhere to, obviously they talk on the call about the general  protection regulations coming out on May 25th in Europe but the interesting  thing as they said, even with those regulations, they don't anticipate  those changes really significantly impacting our revenue, they do think  daily active users could be cracked down in the second quarter but, you  know, that's really not affecting the revenues.  </p><p>And quite honestly the extra regulations with them, it will -- it will help  make their site a lot safer and to some extent it's going to impact their  smaller competitors a lot more.  They don't have same resources as Facebook  to comply with that. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Hi, Dan.  James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal.  I'd like to  talk about those potential smaller competitors.  Normally those kind of fat  profit margins attract competition.  Who is it that can challenge Facebook,  either among startups or existing tech giants moving into their business. </p><p>NILES:  Well, I mean, you obviously know the list of characters, you've got  Twitter, you've got Snapchat obviously, two public companies talked about  most often.  But I mean, they've been competing since the beginning and  you've obviously seen this market is, you know, not necessarily winner take  post but it's sort evolving that way as Facebook continues to execute and  they're executing really across all of the metrics.  So it's not just  growing revenue but they're highly, highly profitable.  </p><p>They have 46 percent operating marks. And so -- and you have to remember,  to some extent they are a startup in different businesses, so we talked  about Facebook, they've got 2.2 billion users and Instagram 800 million  users, so that's great.  What we don't talk about that much is the 1.3  billion users for Facebook messenger is that they just started to make  money off of and they make absolutely no money off of the 1.5 billion  WhatsApp users.  </p><p>So they've got -- to some extent two startups buried within the company  between Messenger and WhatsApp that they still haven't really started to  monetize yet and that gives me a lot of comfort especially when you look at  the multiples of trading at 20 times non-gap, you know, under 18 earnings.   Markets up 17.  These are growing the top line at 50 percent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The world is wash in venture capital.  Are new competitors being  funded?  And if not, why not?  Is Facebook seen as so dominate that that  won't work? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, I think people are trying to work around the edges  but you have to remember with Facebook, there is something pretty unique  which is the network effect.  You're not going to get off of Facebook and  go to Google plus if your friends aren't there.  So, you can't really  easily switch.  If you're dealing with Google for example and somebody came  out with a much better search engine, you know, there's nothing to stop you  from going to the other one, the problem with this is that even if somebody  didn't develop a great other alternative social media site, you're not  going to move unless all of your friends move too.  And that's probably not  going to happen immediately.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan, real quick.  Intel and Microsoft after the bell tonight,  good quarters?  What are you expecting? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, Intel is one of our largest positions.  We like it  quite a bit.  I think the real key for Intel is enterprise demand has been  really bad for the last couple years.  That really started to improve in  the fourth quarter and I think it's going to be very good for this year.   So we like Intel a lot and it's got a low multiple as well in this  environment at about 14 times.  So we like that quite a bit and Microsoft,  similarly we think they should have a pretty solid quarter.  A multiple is  quite a bit higher at 24 times, so not as preferred to us as Intel. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Dan, always great to talk  with you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>NILES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Dan Niles joining us there.  AlphaOne  Capital.  Coming up.  House Republican Conference chair and Washington  Congressman Cathy McMorris Rogders joins me next. We'll get her take on  French President Macron's state visit with President Trump, trade, and a  lot more.  Then a new twist on coffee just in time for summer.  Starbucks  introducing cold foam before reporting earnings after the bell tonight.  We  break down the expectations.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first-quarter earnings, General Motors and Pepsico among  the companies reporting their first-quarter this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations, while PepsiCo was mixed.  Both stocks are under some selling  pressure this morning by a fraction.  Investors are waiting on big tech.   Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all reporting, after the close tonight, all the  stocks are trading up about two percent right now.  </p><p>Broader markets this morning are higher.  March durable goods just came out  up 2.6 percent versus an estimate of 1.6 percent that was better than  expected.  The news is a positive for markets, and we are seeing a pretty  good tone today.  The Dow Industrials set to open about 50 points, that's a  quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up a third of a percent right now.  And the NASDAQ up 50 points,  that's three-quarters of one percent.  The Dow yesterday snapped a five-day  losing streak.  And the momentum continues today.  That was lifted by  Boeing's big earnings beat.  Boeing's stock did well as did the Dow up 60  points at the close, a quarter of a percent higher.  The S&amp;P was also  fractionally better on the day.  The NASDAQ yesterday, closed lower by  three points.  </p><p>In Europe, this morning, the major indices are higher.  The European  Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, and Mario Draghi is about to  speak in his press conference.  FT-100 up 7-1/2, CAC Quarante up 35, that's  two-thirds of a percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a  percent, 43 points higher.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>President Trump lashing out against Jim Comey.  He's targeting the former  FBI Director on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago.  We will tell you what the  President just told our colleagues there.  And breaking news this morning,  Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination as Secretary of Veterans  Affairs.  President Trump weighed in on the announcement earlier this hour  on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" he placed the blame squarely on Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I even told them a day or  two ago.  I saw this was -- where this was going.  And you know they're  very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again first in his class at West  Point, top in class at Harvard Law School, a brilliant guy, a great guy,  and somebody I get along with very well.  You know, Mike got through and  they thought they had him stopped.  The Democrats are obstructionists.   It's horrible what they're doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Capitol Hill coming up this morning.  And then  just in time for summer, Starbucks added -- adds cold foam.  The details  ahead of the company's earnings report later this hour.  The stock is up,  half of a percent.  Plus, it is National Pretzel Day.  We are celebrating  pretzel day here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Wait until you see this pretzel  that they made of my face.  I don't -- I don't think it looks like me but  let me see if I can grab this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is Pretzel Day.  There you go.  OK, we'll get to that coming  up this morning, but first, our top story right now, President Trump  lashing out at Jim Comey, this morning.  Here's what he had to say about  the fired FBI Director in a new interview this morning with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\"  moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Comey is a leaker and he's a liar.  And not only on this stuff,  he's been leaking for years.  He's probably been using his friend, the so- called professor, who now turns out to have FBI clearance which he never  said.  He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress, he  said he gave it to a friend.  And he gave it to a friend to leak classified  information.  It is all classified, it was totally classified.  So, he  illegally -- he did an illegal act, and he said it himself, in order to get  a special counsel against me. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is House Republican Conference Chair and  Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Good to see you,  Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p>REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R), WASHINGTON, CHAIR, HOUSE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this.  You know, I was actually really struck  by the interview last night that Comey did with CNN, and basically he said,  no, I didn't leak anything but then went on to talk about how, in fact, he  did leak these memos that he wrote which as soon as an FBI Director writes  a memo in FBI, you know, headquarters, that is the property of the FBI, but  he said he passed it on to his friend and told his friend, oh, just get  this to the New York Times but don't actually give them the paper, and he  said that's not leaking.  Your reaction.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, it's -- yes, it begs a lot of questions.  And in someone  who believes it's so important that we are restoring trust, that we're  restoring the rule of law in this country, the FBI is the highest law  enforcement agency.  This is -- the people within the FBI must be held to  the highest standards, and that is what causes me so much dismay right now  is just the cloud that is over the FBI, and the questions that it has  raised.  We need the men and women there to act in the utmost authority, as  well as transparency and accountability to the American people.  And so,  yes, he clearly leaked, and it raises a lot of questions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is there going to be any accountability here,  Congresswoman?  I mean, look, last weekend, I had your colleague,  Congressman Devin Nunes on my Sunday morning program and he said, after  looking at all the electronic communications, he realized that there was no  intelligence used to actually launch an investigation into the Trump  campaign.  So, what happens now?  I mean, can we just keep seeing, you  know, people at the top of these important agencies abuse their power with  no accountability?</p><p>RODGERS:  No one is above the law and they must be held accountable.  And  that's the role of Congress, that's the role of the elected representatives  of the people within the House to make sure that we are taking action to  hold them accountable.  So, both in the Intelligence Committee as well as  the government oversight and reform committee which Trey Gowdy is the  chairman of, that's where these questions are asked and that's where  there's been frustration, that documents have not been turned over, that  people have not been as forthright in answering the questions, but it is up  to us to make sure that people are held accountable and that no one is  above the law. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, we'll be watching what develops then.  Then  there is this, the breaking news this breaking news this morning,  Congresswoman, and that is Dr. Ronny Jackson withdrawing his name for  consideration for the head of the V.A., President Trump's pick to lead the  Department of Veterans Affairs pulled his nomination in the last hour amid  all of these questions surrounding his professional conduct.   Congresswoman, your reaction to this news?</p><p>RODGERS:  I respect his decision.  It's most important that we get someone  at the V.A.  Again, we need to restore trust between the veterans and this  agency whose mission is to serve our veterans.  And as someone who  represents nearly 70,000 veterans in eastern Washington, I hear regularly  from veterans who feel like when they contact the V.A. that they're more of  a burden than actually having the red carpet rolled out for them.  So, we  need someone to head up the V.A., we need to get focused on the mission of  the V.A., and make sure that our veterans, those who have served are  getting the care that they need when the time comes, that has to be a top  priority for us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean, can we just ignore all of the barriers and the  booby traps that the left is putting in place for the Trump administration?   I mean, look at all of the positions that are yet unfilled.  Look at all of  the slow walking going on in terms of getting his nominees passed.  You  know, Mike Pompeo got -- you know, got support, but it was close.  I mean,  what about that, who is doing this?  We know that three administrations  have said how great Dr. Ronny Jackson is and all of a sudden, somebody  leaks all of this speculation about his personal life.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, that is -- yes, that's tough to see, and I respect his  decision just to pull out.  I am concerned that the left is putting  politics ahead of what's best for the country, and there's so many --  there's the V.A. position, Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, he's an  honorable man, a well-respected leader, he's proven himself, and yet too  many were willing to put politics ahead of what was best for the country.   We do need to get these people in place because that is part of making sure  that President Trump has the people around him to actually lead, and people  equal policy and he needs these people in place so that we can keep moving  forward.  There's a lot on our plate right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think people are figuring this out, that there's -- all of  these booby traps that are being put in by the skeptics and critics of  President Trump.  And then there's China, of course, reportedly threatening  to \"fierce counterstrike\" if the President goes ahead with these another  $100 billion in tariffs as punishment for the alleged intellectual property  theft.  Congressman, your thoughts on this.  I know Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary and a whole delegation are going next week to meet with  their counterparts in China to talk this out.</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, there's too many examples of illegal practices by  China, where we have seen them taking our intellectual property and  duplicating it.  I have examples in Eastern Washington, Washington State,  and it destroys companies here in America.  I am encouraged that President  Trump is focused on making sure that we hold China accountable.  I have had  concerns about the across-the-board approach to tariffs that, you know, he  was talking about imposing upon steel and aluminum.  I do believe it needs  to be more targeted but we must hold a country like China accountable for  illegal practices or free and fair trade will never work. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bottom line, do you think that the President with his tough  talk and the team is going to be able to account that budget deficit with  China, which is already now up to 375 billion?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, if anyone can do it, I believe it's President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes,</p><p>RODGERS:  And he is focused on this.  I had the chance to spend some time  with Larry Kudlow just last week.  I'm really pleased to see him as the  head of the economic advisors, his chief economic adviser.  He understands  economics, world trade, and also what's going on in China.  And he  basically told us everything is on the table, tariffs, no tariffs,  sanctions, but we must hold them accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's going to be on that trip as well, Larry Kudlow, and  Peter Navarro.  What about this budget about face, Congresswoman?   President Trump is now urging lawmakers to rescind some of the spending of  that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill which he signed last month.   Congresswoman, are there enough votes to make it happen and obviously you  must be getting just as much pushback as so many others are, for signing  that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill with all the spending?</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, we must address the spending in this country.  It  is the number one threat that faces us, both from a military perspective as  well as economic perspective, we needed to get a budget in place, but it  spends too much, and that's where I am -- I'm actually encouraged that the  President, Mick Mulvaney is leading on putting together a rescission  package.  </p><p>We should have been doing this all along, really taking a look at those  opportunities to go into programs, go into agencies and actually through  the House and the Senate, cut the spending.  The budget process is broken,  the House passed all 12 of our appropriations bills.  We went through  program by program, agency by agency, the Senate did zero.  So, this has  been very frustrating.  </p><p>This is our fundamental job as the elected representatives, this is where  we exercise the power of the purse, and yet this process is broken.  So, I  am -- I definitely want to look at what the President -- what they can  propose.  I think the House and Senate should also be using this tool of  rescissions to take action that we can to reduce those deficits and reduce  the debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his three-day  state visit with an address to the joint meeting of Congress.  How was it,  what was your takeaway?  He was critical of the President's planned  withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, I think, it is important that these conversations continue.   I've never been a supporter of the Iran deal.  I thought it was bad deal.   It did not hold Iran accountable for not developing or obtaining nuclear  weapons.  And that's where we need our European allies to join us in making  sure that we have a deal that is going to accomplish the goal of ensuring  that they do not develop nuclear weapons.  And right now, we do not have  that confidence. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, real quick, who are you supporting for Speaker of  the House?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, you know, I -- we need to make sure that we are voting on a  Republican speaker after the elections, so we need to stay focused on the  policy and on our midterms and making sure that we're getting that done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Thanks so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ford Motor now pulling all but two of its  passenger cars from its North American line up as part of a plan to save  money and make the company more competitive.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  Stu, a car company canceling all of its  cars?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Well, you know, if you can't make money  selling cars, I guess you forget about selling cars, and you go to light  trucks and SUVs because that's where the money is.  It's a perfectly  rational move but boy, does it come as a shock.  You know, when I think of  the Ford Motor company, I think of the Taurus, one of the best-selling  marks for almost a generation.  It's gone.  They're not going to sell that  thing in North America any longer.  The Fiesta is going.  A couple of other  marks, I guess you'd call them, are going.  I was just shocked to hear  that.  It's a car company, but it's not a car company.  It's now a light  truck and SUV company because it wants to make some more money.  Look at  the stock, up 2-1/2 percent, just because its walking away from the car  market.  I wondered if General Motors will do something similar or FiatChrysler, walk away from unprofitable lines because you got to make money  in this environment and that's what you got to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really fascinating.</p><p>VARNEY:  I find it fascinating, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is -- it is fascinating.  And remember the last CEO wanted  to make it a mobility company.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  My, how times change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  I know you'll have a  lot more on it.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Sure, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart.  It is the busiest day of  the earnings season today, G.M. one of the big names out this morning.   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the  numbers.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The busiest day  of 68 S&amp;P 500 companies, and to your point, your chat with Stuart, guess  what, G.M. is doing much of the same, focusing on a highly-profitable  pickup trucks, and that's what's costing them going forward for 2018.  So,  for the quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line.  Profit was on  the rise, and it's the high-margin vehicles that they're going to be  working on.  So, 2018, they expect that they will have flat profits but  expect the all new pickup trucks would boost the margins in 2019.  The  stock is down a half of one percent.  </p><p>Then, let's take a look at Starbucks.  So, we're expecting for Starbucks to  report after the bell today.  Global same-store sales are likely on the  rise to the tune of about 1.8 percent.  They still, obviously or have the  P.R. that they have to deal with from Philadelphia, removing those two  black men, but big spot is China.  That's where they see the growth.  In  fact, they're opening one new store in China every 15 hours.  And also, you  can get cold foam on your new -- on your new Starbucks.  All right, Dagen,  back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  So, coming up, it's not your average  day.  We are celebrating National Pretzel Day.  Maria's pretzel with a  small business is growing fast.  We take you live to plaza, where there is  a pretzel truck waiting.  I've already eaten one, they're delicious.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you outside on the plaza,  outside headquarters.  What a twist in this National Pretzel Day.  We are  celebrating in style with a small business that is growing fast.  Joining  me right now is Dan Dizio, he's the CEO and co-founder of Philly Pretzel  Factory and we've got the team here ready to munch on all pretzels.  Dan,  great to see you.  </p><p>DAN DIZIO, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY:  Me, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, and I love the MORNINGS WITH  MARIA in pretzel.  That is very cool, nice touch.  You've been selling  pretzels since you're 11 on the corner in Philadelphia.  Tell us how you  started your business.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, my next door neighbor had a pretzel bakery, got stuck with a  bunch of pretzels.  I'm 47 now.  This week, I'll be 47.  And he got stuck.   A woman asked if I would sell them on the shoe corner and we would split  the money.  And my mom said it would be OK.  He had to ask my mom  permission, and, for some reasons, my mom said it would be OK to stand on  the street corner all day (INAUDIBLE) but she said it was a different time  back then.  So -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  And, yes, I did it, and did real well, and the next thing I know  every guy was selling pretzels, and did all through middle school and high  school.  And I went to college and was a graduate, and had a stockbroker  job and just didn't like the 9:00 to 5:00 thing, and I want to get back to  the pretzel business and I talked my college roommate into doing a pretzel  business and that's how it started, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You started with the food truck, the Philly Pretzel Factory,  you've got the food truck -- Hi, everybody.  Did you have a pretzel?  Tell  me about the food truck business because this is a really successful way to  sell.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we've had the truck for a few years now.  We're really doing  well with the weddings, bar mitzvahs, just different event.  I mean,  there's different places we could take it, so it'd be mobile.  That's the  way you have to be in this moment right now as for -- be able to  (INAUDIBLE) and be able to bring the pretzel to the people where they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, you have 170 locations across the country.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're opening more stores.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we're actually opening up 25 in New York right now.  We just  did area development deal to open up 25 in Manhattan over the next few  years.  So, we're excited about that.  And we have about 42 stores under  development.  So, we're really excited.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  How long does it take to actually bake a pretzel?</p><p>DIZIO:  It takes about seven minutes to bake a pretzel.  Yes, yes.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  Some of these.  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  And some sausage, am I right?</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm digging it.</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.  (INAUDIBLE) This is a new product we had.  It's  our mini hotdog trade.  We've done really well over the years with hotdog  pretzels.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a mini-hotdog stand.  I like that.</p><p>DIZIO:  And we do many hotdogs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fit for a party. </p><p>DIZIO:  That's exactly what it's meant for.  Tailgating parties.  It's been  a big hit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the Republican tax plan, did that impact you as a small  business?</p><p>DIZIO:  It actually did.  I mean, more money for the small businesses.   Remember, our franchisees are business owners and there are small  businesses in communities, and to be able to have a tax break for them,  really lets them reinvest, maybe open another location up, reinvest.  I  mean, these are part of the community, these franchise locations.  I mean,  they sponsored the little league.  They have more money to do these things  and it really does have that effect to help everything in their  communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p>DIZIO:  It's -- we're doing a lot in Midwest, a lot down south.  I mean,  Philadelphia has been haven for pretzels and it is where it all started.   So, we're stretching out, we're in 19 states now and it continues to grow  and people are fascinated and falling in love with the (INAUDIBLE) once we  had --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  These are so good, Maria.  We have to get involved.  These are so  good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan Dizio, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  Thank you.  It's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait, can I have the (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  These are just out of the oven.  Stuart Varney,  over to you.  Do you want to have pretzels?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Delivery, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll have it set up for you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take it away, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The details  as Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination in a growing scrutiny from  lawmakers.  And the West Wing, Kanye not backing down from his support of  President Trump.  The Rapper's powerful message to his critics coming up.   A new robot that's more than meets the eye how scientists in Japan created  a real life transformer.  All of those coming up this morning and joining  me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall  Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman along with  Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth.  Great  to see you guys.  </p><p> PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And great show so far.  We got a lot on the docket.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Sad story about Ronny Jackson.   This guy has really  served his country honorably and well and this is how Washington treats him  on the way out.  Just horrendous.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that is the news of the moment. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't know if he's going to remain the doctor at the White  House but really, he didn't deserve this.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Well, it's a way for some people to try and  discourage from anybody serving in the Trump administration.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  A way to create chaos in President Trump's  administration.  That is the breaking news.  Dr. Ronny Jackson has  withdrawn as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Blake Burman is  live at the White House with all the details right now.  And Blake, the  news just broke about 10 minutes ago.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.  And Ronny Jackson has put out a  statement within the last few minutes here, Maria.  the bottom line with  this was the allegations just continue to pile and pile up against Dr.  Jackson who is the White House doctor had served under President George W.  Bush, President Obama, and now as the personal doctor as well to President  Trump who nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The  allegations were that he was drinking on the job, overprescribing medicine,  fostering a hostile work environment.  </p><p> Jackson had denied all of that but this morning says he does not want to go  forward with this process.  In a statement Jackson says the following,  \"going into the process, I expected tough questions about how to best care  for our veterans but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and  anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.  </p><p> He goes on to say, \"the allegations against me are completely false and  fabricating.  If they had any merit, I would not have been selected,  promoted, and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as  physician to three Presidents over the past 12 years.\"  The White House  throughout all of this over the last few days continues to stand by  Jackson, there was a Press Secretary Sarah Sanders joining the briefing  yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Through Jackson's  record as a White House physician has been impeccable.  In fact because Dr.  Jackson has worked within arm's reach of three Presidents, he has received  more vetting than most nominees.  Given this unique position of trust and  responsibility, Dr. Jackson's background and character were evaluated  during three different administrations.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  One thing that keep in mind here, Maria, is before all of these  allegations started rolling in and before the folks up on Capitol Hill put  a temporary pause on the nomination process.  There were serious questions  about whether or not Jackson was qualified to handle such a huge  bureaucracy.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, the President during that  news conference with Emmanuel Macron backed Jackson by saying look, this is  his decision to make, he is a qualified to lead this department and we will  find out from Jackson what he decides to do.  This morning, we have found  out he has pulled his name out from the nomination process and now the  White House has yet another open slot to fill, someone to lead the V.A.   Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that is exactly what the left and the resist movement wants  as much chaos as possible around the Trump administration.  Joining us  right now is Gianno Caldwell, we just saw in the moment.  Gianno, thanks  very much for being here this morning.  Fox News Political Analyst,  Republican strategists, Caldwell strategic consulting founder.  Your  reaction to this.  I mean, obviously, this is more -- booby traps in the  Trump administration.  Who leaked all of this or created this around Dr.  Ronny Jackson forcing him to withdraw in your view? </p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  We've seen leaks throughout  this entire start of this administration.  And I think it's very  unfortunate.  Further, I think Sarah Sanders said something that was  particularly interesting and I -- and I thought to be very true that Dr.  Ronny Jackson is an individual who's been vetted by three administrations.   So if these were to be true why wasn't that found to be the case in these  other vetting processes?  So it's something that I think that's obviously  harmful to the Trump administration because we've seen nominees put their  name in and have to withdraw.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> CALDWELL:  So that particularly problematic.  And I'm sad to see him go but  I know that there are some other good people that can step in his place.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> CALDWELL:  I think an excellent candidate with V.P. to be the new V.A.  secretary.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, exact -- well, we talked about that earlier, you're  absolutely right.  But I mean, is -- are the people going to -- going to  come forward and make noise about this?  How is this going to stop with all  of these, you know, booby traps and barriers that the resist movement is  putting in place for the Trump administration? </p><p> HEGSETH:  I think your only option in situation like this is to fight back  and fight back ferociously because it isn't just the leaks, it isn't just  the Obama administration.  Do watch other networks --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The media.</p><p> HEGSETH:  They go wall-to-wall on person speculation, anonymously source  with no verification to smear this guy.  I was forced to watch one of these  other networks yesterday for whatever reason and they didn't stop, it was  all Ronny Jackson, all based on nothing.  Gianno, how do you overcome that  in this environment?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  You know what, I think that's why it's been President Trump's  best quality.  You saw that through the 2015 election where they would  smear him, they would come at him hard and he wouldn't back down.  And I  think that that President Trump is going to people who love and that's the  reason why he actually won the election.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CALDWELL:  And we have to see more of that just that we're going to push  back, we're going to push book no matter what you say and how you try to  smear people because these are legitimately good people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's all shaming, it's public shaming.  I'll tell you who  is pushing back, Kanye West.  He's calling it the mob.  Let's talk about  his Make America Great moment.  The rapper face backlash for praising  President Trump yesterday posting on Twitter.  Here's what he said, Kanye  West.  You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob cannot make me not  love him.  We are both dragging energy, he is my brother, I love everyone,  I don't agree with everything anyone does.  That's what makes us  individuals and we have the right to independent thought.  Amen to Kanye  West.  Good for him.</p><p> CALDWELL:  Amen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He goes on to -- and then the President actually responded, and  the President tweeted out, thank you, Kanye.  Very cool.  Gianno, your  reaction.  </p><p> CALDWELL:  You know, it's interesting.  I'm in my hometown at Chicago right  now and of course this is where Kanye is from.  And I'll be talking about  this on largest urban radio station after this interview but this is I  think excellent.  And I'll tell you why I think it's excellent.  Kanye West  has been an individual who's not willing to back down, he's unrelenting in  what he believes.  And I think that the degree, he really appreciates that  in President Trump more than anything.  </p><p> We saw in the 2016 election as I mentioned before, President Trump did not  back down, whatsoever and I wrote a piece about him in the Hill why the  Republican base (INAUDIBLE) it won't break and he read it and sent me a  note.  And in that piece, I said that the Republicans chose him as the guy  that they wanted to win elections because after the media began to attack  him and he was losing business deals, he lost millions saying what he  believes.  </p><p> He didn't step back like most businessmen would, he didn't step back like  most politicians would, he doubled down on it.  And with that being the  case, then says that I'm unapologetic in my view, I'm unapologetic in  American First policies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CALDWELL:  And I'm unapologetic keeping our country safe.  And I think most  people can appreciate that, most people can evaluate that and most people  voted for that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Gianno though, it's Dagen.  Never forget, Kanye is always about  Kanye.  Kanye is not about -- he is not -- he is not standing up for any  issue quite frankly, he is doing -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a shame.  He's pushing back on shaming, calling them  the mob.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I argue that he is doing it for the attention because he knows  that basically siding with President Trump will get him the most attention.   Going after President Obama will get him the most attention.  He isn't  married to the Kardashian clan after all.  Maybe they're learning from him  rather than the other way around.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But this also started after the USA communications  director Candace Owens, she hit back at the Democratic Party and she  defend-- she was Fox last night with Martha.  Listen to how she defended  Kanye and what she said.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CANDACE OWENS, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Once they inflate our body's  Democratic Party, let's say they haven't slayed our minds, they have told  true who we must love, who we must hate, what we must think, what ideas are  unacceptable.  In the long run, it just -- it just doesn't add up.  Listen,  I think differently, Kanye West thinks differently.  I can guarantee you if  he and I get in the same room, we will have a lot of disagreements.  The  one thing that we will celebrate is our right to think differently.  I  don't understand what's so controversial for the left to understand this.   The way that they had demonized him in the last 72 hours, it's almost  sickening but at the end of the day it's going to have adverse effects.  I  can guarantee you that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well said, Candace.  Gianno, what do you make of all of this?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  I agree with what Candace has said and I'm going to have to push  back on Dagen just a -- just a bit respectfully.  Kanye is about himself,  that's unquestionable.  I know we all realize that.  However, this is an  individual who definitely has gone against ever since I have known him  before he became a national figure.  The marginalization of thought.   Specifically marginalization of who we are as individuals so often as the  society were programmed.  </p><p> I believe to do what's reasonable and what were pretty much taught in  school and I think he goes beyond that and says look, let's look deep  inside ourselves and fulfill our greatest potential.  And generally  speaking when you do that, when you legitimately do that, it's going to  make people uncomfortable and say, hey what you're doing is unreasonable  and maybe you should rethink your decision but generally speaking the  greatest folks we've seen, Mark Zuckerberg, Kanye West, Donald Trump, the  individuals that really succeeded become these megastars are the ones that  go beyond what's public as a final thought.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  All right.  James Freeman here at the Journal.  I'm not sure why  we're talking about Kanye allegedly being all about himself.  I mean, I  don't know -- I don't know what's in his head but the idea that someone  puts out a message that compliments the President, encourages people to  think freely, and says he loves everyone.  Or why are you saying -- well,  he's about himself?</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can ask me that question because I'm the one who said it --</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- James because he does -- he does and says things to garner  the most attention.  And so being complimentary in this environment,  President Obama is not going to garner him the most attention.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But I'm not going to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think he has courage by saying it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He has to --</p><p> FREEMAN:  It's triggering a very important conversation.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But -- he -- Kanye West has never lacked courage.  I'm not  arguing that.  I'm just saying that there's always a motive and it is about  -- Kanye is not right or left, not Democrat or Republican, Kanye is Kanye  at the end of the day.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CALDWELL:  He has an album that's coming out and he loves --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right. The album is coming out.</p><p> CALDWELL:  -- due to his compliments in the President.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, this -- they shame you if you say anything positive about  the President.  You know, you get shamed online if you say anything  positive about the President.  I like to see somebody, who pushes back  because it's wrong.  </p><p> CALDWELL:  And he's is breaking the mode on that, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's breaking --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CALDWELL:  Because we've got -- we've gone to an extreme point in time  where you can't say anything complimentary about President Trump.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then there's Former FBI Director Jim Comey who's been  trashing the President in every interview and he leaked memos, a catalyst  for the special counsel investigation.  That memo was more wildly shared  than we thought initially.  Sources telling Fox News Comey likely gave the  documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another  person along with the with Columbia Law School professor and watch Comey  struggle to defend his actions last night at a CNN town hall.  Listen to  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  You did leak memos, I mean, is it OK for  somebody at the FBI to leak something, an internal document even if it's  not classified?  Isn't that leaking? </p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  It was a whole lot wrong with your  question, Anderson.  First, I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to  communicate the substance of one unclassified </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that  it'd be out in media, I wanted it to get in the media.  As a private  citizen, I could do that and did that just as I have written about it in my  book.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Does he think just saying this is going to make people think  otherwise?  We're -- we saw what happened.  Gianno, your reaction.  </p><p> CALDWELL:  That is my definition leaking.  He gave information and now,  this is developing at the harvest of the FBI and he gave it to a friend, to  spring this special counsel and if I -- if I recall correctly, I think it  was reported at The Washington -- Wall Street Journal who said after  reading the Comey memos, there is -- they see no reason why there should  have been a special counsel to begin with.  So with that being the case,  Jim Comey definitely is in a position where he's losing all credibility if  he had any left.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget that zero intelligence that was used  to launch the investigation which Devin Nunes told us about.  Gianno, thank  you.  Good to see you.</p><p> CALDWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p> CALDWELL:  Good seeing you.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive dragnet in Maine after a man shot and  killed a sheriff's deputy.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, John Williams.  They say that the 29-year-old gunned down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine.  That is just  North of Augusta.  Williams drove the cruiser to a nearby convenience store  and he robbed it.  Police releasing this photo, this captured of him from  inside of the stolen car.  He then abandoned that car nearby, he has not  been seen since.  Deputy Cole had been on the force 13 years. He leaves  behind a son.  The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot at  a Dallas Home Depot, one of them was killed there.  Officer Rogelio  Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him  in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest.  22 officers have  been shot and killed so far this year.  That is more than double from the  same time last year and on average, you're not going to believe this, at  least one officer has reportedly been shot to death every week in 2018.  </p><p> Well, earning season is in high gear this morning.  We're just getting  results from a couple of big airlines, you know, and let's start with  American, the stock is trading lower almost 4-1/2 percent to the downside  in the premarket.  Their first quarter revenue just missed the street  estimate.  Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents actually topped  expectations, not helping out though.  Let's take a look at Southwest, they  also are under pressure ahead of the opening bell down more than 3-1/2  percent.  Revenue coming up short of estimates.  Southwest did add -- the  bookings are down after an engine on its one planes exploded last week  killing a passenger and that was Southwest's first fatality in the  carrier's history.  </p><p> And then finally there's this.  You want to be careful, the next car that  you hop in to might be Megatron.  Japanese engineers created a real life  Transformer that can actually carry people onboard.  This is the first  scene we've ever seen anything like this.  It's a robot car.  It walks over  18 miles an hour and transforms into a sports car with people still inside.   The robot creator says he was yes inspired by his childhood Transformer  heroes that he watched in the movies in growing up.  There you have it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, very cool.</p><p> CASONE:  Very cool.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  The outlook on trade with China, big delegation  going next week.  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers will weigh in on the  new report that Chinese companies are already reconsidering investments in  the American market as Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary gets set to  visit his counterpart in China next week.  Then founding partner of  AlphaOne Capital Partners Dan Niles joins me to talk about Facebook's  quarterly results, he predicted the company would beat.  I'll get his take  on the company's surging revenue and where it goes next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Focus on Facebook.  The social media company  beat earnings and revenue expectations last night despite the fallout from  the privacy scandal.  Yesterday, Facebook reported adjusted earnings per  share of $1.69 on revenue of $11.97 billion.  That was the first quarter of  2018.  Shares of Facebook right now are up seven percent in the premarket.   Joining us right now on the telephone is the founding partner of AlphaOne  Capital Partners, Dan Niles.  One of his big positions is Facebook.  And  Dan, good to have you.  Thanks very much for weighing in here.  You  predicted that the company would beat revenue and earnings expectations.   What's your take away from the numbers?</p><p> DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDING PARTNER (via telephone):  I  mean, quite honestly, it's even better than what I was expecting.  You have  to look at the revenues first and revenues year-over-year in the June  quarter were up 45 percent.  And the September and December quarters,  accelerated up 47 percent.  And what's interesting is even with all the  negative publicity around the supposed data scandal, the revenues  accelerates 50 percent year over year in (INAUDIBLE) they keep the  operating income by about 14 percent where their margins were better than  expected and they keep the ETF by over 20 percent.  I mean, back out some  of the one time.  So it's really hard to find a whole lot negative in the  report. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about expenses going forward in this whole regulatory  scrutiny?  I mean, are we going to see, you know, new rules regulations  that this company is going to have to adhere to in the entire industry,  we'll have to adhere to that will change the reason to own the stock  because expenses are higher?</p><p> NILES:  Yes.  I really don't think so.  I mean, here is a way to think  about it.  Even though expenses they guided to up 50 to 60 percent,  originally they guided up 45 to 60.  Estimates are actually going up after  this print because they beat the operating income margins by so much that  even though their guiding expenses higher most of the street is actually  raising EPS.  </p><p> The second thing is, I'm sure there will be some extra regulations they  need to adhere to, obviously they talk on the call about the general  protection regulations coming out on May 25th in Europe but the interesting  thing as they said, even with those regulations, they don't anticipate  those changes really significantly impacting our revenue, they do think  daily active users could be cracked down in the second quarter but, you  know, that's really not affecting the revenues.  </p><p> And quite honestly the extra regulations with them, it will -- it will help  make their site a lot safer and to some extent it's going to impact their  smaller competitors a lot more.  They don't have same resources as Facebook  to comply with that. </p><p> FREEMAN:  Hi, Dan.  James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal.  I'd like to  talk about those potential smaller competitors.  Normally those kind of fat  profit margins attract competition.  Who is it that can challenge Facebook,  either among startups or existing tech giants moving into their business. </p><p> NILES:  Well, I mean, you obviously know the list of characters, you've got  Twitter, you've got Snapchat obviously, two public companies talked about  most often.  But I mean, they've been competing since the beginning and  you've obviously seen this market is, you know, not necessarily winner take  post but it's sort evolving that way as Facebook continues to execute and  they're executing really across all of the metrics.  So it's not just  growing revenue but they're highly, highly profitable.  </p><p> They have 46 percent operating marks. And so -- and you have to remember,  to some extent they are a startup in different businesses, so we talked  about Facebook, they've got 2.2 billion users and Instagram 800 million  users, so that's great.  What we don't talk about that much is the 1.3  billion users for Facebook messenger is that they just started to make  money off of and they make absolutely no money off of the 1.5 billion  WhatsApp users.  </p><p> So they've got -- to some extent two startups buried within the company  between Messenger and WhatsApp that they still haven't really started to  monetize yet and that gives me a lot of comfort especially when you look at  the multiples of trading at 20 times non-gap, you know, under 18 earnings.   Markets up 17.  These are growing the top line at 50 percent. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FREEMAN:  I'm sorry.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  The world is wash in venture capital.  Are new competitors being  funded?  And if not, why not?  Is Facebook seen as so dominate that that  won't work? </p><p> NILES:  Yes.  I mean, I think people are trying to work around the edges  but you have to remember with Facebook, there is something pretty unique  which is the network effect.  You're not going to get off of Facebook and  go to Google plus if your friends aren't there.  So, you can't really  easily switch.  If you're dealing with Google for example and somebody came  out with a much better search engine, you know, there's nothing to stop you  from going to the other one, the problem with this is that even if somebody  didn't develop a great other alternative social media site, you're not  going to move unless all of your friends move too.  And that's probably not  going to happen immediately.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dan, real quick.  Intel and Microsoft after the bell tonight,  good quarters?  What are you expecting? </p><p> NILES:  Yes.  I mean, Intel is one of our largest positions.  We like it  quite a bit.  I think the real key for Intel is enterprise demand has been  really bad for the last couple years.  That really started to improve in  the fourth quarter and I think it's going to be very good for this year.   So we like Intel a lot and it's got a low multiple as well in this  environment at about 14 times.  So we like that quite a bit and Microsoft,  similarly we think they should have a pretty solid quarter.  A multiple is  quite a bit higher at 24 times, so not as preferred to us as Intel. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Dan, always great to talk  with you.  Thanks so much.</p><p> NILES:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Dan Niles joining us there.  AlphaOne  Capital.  Coming up.  House Republican Conference chair and Washington  Congressman Cathy McMorris Rogders joins me next. We'll get her take on  French President Macron's state visit with President Trump, trade, and a  lot more.  Then a new twist on coffee just in time for summer.  Starbucks  introducing cold foam before reporting earnings after the bell tonight.  We  break down the expectations.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first-quarter earnings, General Motors and Pepsico among  the companies reporting their first-quarter this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations, while PepsiCo was mixed.  Both stocks are under some selling  pressure this morning by a fraction.  Investors are waiting on big tech.   Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all reporting, after the close tonight, all the  stocks are trading up about two percent right now.  </p><p> Broader markets this morning are higher.  March durable goods just came out  up 2.6 percent versus an estimate of 1.6 percent that was better than  expected.  The news is a positive for markets, and we are seeing a pretty  good tone today.  The Dow Industrials set to open about 50 points, that's a  quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p> The S&amp;P is up a third of a percent right now.  And the NASDAQ up 50 points,  that's three-quarters of one percent.  The Dow yesterday snapped a five-day  losing streak.  And the momentum continues today.  That was lifted by  Boeing's big earnings beat.  Boeing's stock did well as did the Dow up 60  points at the close, a quarter of a percent higher.  The S&amp;P was also  fractionally better on the day.  The NASDAQ yesterday, closed lower by  three points.  </p><p> In Europe, this morning, the major indices are higher.  The European  Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, and Mario Draghi is about to  speak in his press conference.  FT-100 up 7-1/2, CAC Quarante up 35, that's  two-thirds of a percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a  percent, 43 points higher.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p> President Trump lashing out against Jim Comey.  He's targeting the former  FBI Director on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago.  We will tell you what the  President just told our colleagues there.  And breaking news this morning,  Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination as Secretary of Veterans  Affairs.  President Trump weighed in on the announcement earlier this hour  on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" he placed the blame squarely on Democrats.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I even told them a day or  two ago.  I saw this was -- where this was going.  And you know they're  very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again first in his class at West  Point, top in class at Harvard Law School, a brilliant guy, a great guy,  and somebody I get along with very well.  You know, Mike got through and  they thought they had him stopped.  The Democrats are obstructionists.   It's horrible what they're doing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Capitol Hill coming up this morning.  And then  just in time for summer, Starbucks added -- adds cold foam.  The details  ahead of the company's earnings report later this hour.  The stock is up,  half of a percent.  Plus, it is National Pretzel Day.  We are celebrating  pretzel day here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Wait until you see this pretzel  that they made of my face.  I don't -- I don't think it looks like me but  let me see if I can grab this.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is Pretzel Day.  There you go.  OK, we'll get to that coming  up this morning, but first, our top story right now, President Trump  lashing out at Jim Comey, this morning.  Here's what he had to say about  the fired FBI Director in a new interview this morning with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\"  moments ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  Comey is a leaker and he's a liar.  And not only on this stuff,  he's been leaking for years.  He's probably been using his friend, the so- called professor, who now turns out to have FBI clearance which he never  said.  He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress, he  said he gave it to a friend.  And he gave it to a friend to leak classified  information.  It is all classified, it was totally classified.  So, he  illegally -- he did an illegal act, and he said it himself, in order to get  a special counsel against me. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is House Republican Conference Chair and  Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Good to see you,  Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p> REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R), WASHINGTON, CHAIR, HOUSE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE:  Good to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this.  You know, I was actually really struck  by the interview last night that Comey did with CNN, and basically he said,  no, I didn't leak anything but then went on to talk about how, in fact, he  did leak these memos that he wrote which as soon as an FBI Director writes  a memo in FBI, you know, headquarters, that is the property of the FBI, but  he said he passed it on to his friend and told his friend, oh, just get  this to the New York Times but don't actually give them the paper, and he  said that's not leaking.  Your reaction.</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, it's -- yes, it begs a lot of questions.  And in someone  who believes it's so important that we are restoring trust, that we're  restoring the rule of law in this country, the FBI is the highest law  enforcement agency.  This is -- the people within the FBI must be held to  the highest standards, and that is what causes me so much dismay right now  is just the cloud that is over the FBI, and the questions that it has  raised.  We need the men and women there to act in the utmost authority, as  well as transparency and accountability to the American people.  And so,  yes, he clearly leaked, and it raises a lot of questions.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But is there going to be any accountability here,  Congresswoman?  I mean, look, last weekend, I had your colleague,  Congressman Devin Nunes on my Sunday morning program and he said, after  looking at all the electronic communications, he realized that there was no  intelligence used to actually launch an investigation into the Trump  campaign.  So, what happens now?  I mean, can we just keep seeing, you  know, people at the top of these important agencies abuse their power with  no accountability?</p><p> RODGERS:  No one is above the law and they must be held accountable.  And  that's the role of Congress, that's the role of the elected representatives  of the people within the House to make sure that we are taking action to  hold them accountable.  So, both in the Intelligence Committee as well as  the government oversight and reform committee which Trey Gowdy is the  chairman of, that's where these questions are asked and that's where  there's been frustration, that documents have not been turned over, that  people have not been as forthright in answering the questions, but it is up  to us to make sure that people are held accountable and that no one is  above the law. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, we'll be watching what develops then.  Then  there is this, the breaking news this breaking news this morning,  Congresswoman, and that is Dr. Ronny Jackson withdrawing his name for  consideration for the head of the V.A., President Trump's pick to lead the  Department of Veterans Affairs pulled his nomination in the last hour amid  all of these questions surrounding his professional conduct.   Congresswoman, your reaction to this news?</p><p> RODGERS:  I respect his decision.  It's most important that we get someone  at the V.A.  Again, we need to restore trust between the veterans and this  agency whose mission is to serve our veterans.  And as someone who  represents nearly 70,000 veterans in eastern Washington, I hear regularly  from veterans who feel like when they contact the V.A. that they're more of  a burden than actually having the red carpet rolled out for them.  So, we  need someone to head up the V.A., we need to get focused on the mission of  the V.A., and make sure that our veterans, those who have served are  getting the care that they need when the time comes, that has to be a top  priority for us. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But I mean, can we just ignore all of the barriers and the  booby traps that the left is putting in place for the Trump administration?   I mean, look at all of the positions that are yet unfilled.  Look at all of  the slow walking going on in terms of getting his nominees passed.  You  know, Mike Pompeo got -- you know, got support, but it was close.  I mean,  what about that, who is doing this?  We know that three administrations  have said how great Dr. Ronny Jackson is and all of a sudden, somebody  leaks all of this speculation about his personal life.</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, that is -- yes, that's tough to see, and I respect his  decision just to pull out.  I am concerned that the left is putting  politics ahead of what's best for the country, and there's so many --  there's the V.A. position, Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, he's an  honorable man, a well-respected leader, he's proven himself, and yet too  many were willing to put politics ahead of what was best for the country.   We do need to get these people in place because that is part of making sure  that President Trump has the people around him to actually lead, and people  equal policy and he needs these people in place so that we can keep moving  forward.  There's a lot on our plate right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think people are figuring this out, that there's -- all of  these booby traps that are being put in by the skeptics and critics of  President Trump.  And then there's China, of course, reportedly threatening  to \"fierce counterstrike\" if the President goes ahead with these another  $100 billion in tariffs as punishment for the alleged intellectual property  theft.  Congressman, your thoughts on this.  I know Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary and a whole delegation are going next week to meet with  their counterparts in China to talk this out.</p><p> RODGERS:  Right.  Well, there's too many examples of illegal practices by  China, where we have seen them taking our intellectual property and  duplicating it.  I have examples in Eastern Washington, Washington State,  and it destroys companies here in America.  I am encouraged that President  Trump is focused on making sure that we hold China accountable.  I have had  concerns about the across-the-board approach to tariffs that, you know, he  was talking about imposing upon steel and aluminum.  I do believe it needs  to be more targeted but we must hold a country like China accountable for  illegal practices or free and fair trade will never work. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Bottom line, do you think that the President with his tough  talk and the team is going to be able to account that budget deficit with  China, which is already now up to 375 billion?</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, if anyone can do it, I believe it's President Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes,</p><p> RODGERS:  And he is focused on this.  I had the chance to spend some time  with Larry Kudlow just last week.  I'm really pleased to see him as the  head of the economic advisors, his chief economic adviser.  He understands  economics, world trade, and also what's going on in China.  And he  basically told us everything is on the table, tariffs, no tariffs,  sanctions, but we must hold them accountable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he's going to be on that trip as well, Larry Kudlow, and  Peter Navarro.  What about this budget about face, Congresswoman?   President Trump is now urging lawmakers to rescind some of the spending of  that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill which he signed last month.   Congresswoman, are there enough votes to make it happen and obviously you  must be getting just as much pushback as so many others are, for signing  that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill with all the spending?</p><p> RODGERS:  Right.  Well, we must address the spending in this country.  It  is the number one threat that faces us, both from a military perspective as  well as economic perspective, we needed to get a budget in place, but it  spends too much, and that's where I am -- I'm actually encouraged that the  President, Mick Mulvaney is leading on putting together a rescission  package.  </p><p> We should have been doing this all along, really taking a look at those  opportunities to go into programs, go into agencies and actually through  the House and the Senate, cut the spending.  The budget process is broken,  the House passed all 12 of our appropriations bills.  We went through  program by program, agency by agency, the Senate did zero.  So, this has  been very frustrating.  </p><p> This is our fundamental job as the elected representatives, this is where  we exercise the power of the purse, and yet this process is broken.  So, I  am -- I definitely want to look at what the President -- what they can  propose.  I think the House and Senate should also be using this tool of  rescissions to take action that we can to reduce those deficits and reduce  the debt.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his three-day  state visit with an address to the joint meeting of Congress.  How was it,  what was your takeaway?  He was critical of the President's planned  withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, I think, it is important that these conversations continue.   I've never been a supporter of the Iran deal.  I thought it was bad deal.   It did not hold Iran accountable for not developing or obtaining nuclear  weapons.  And that's where we need our European allies to join us in making  sure that we have a deal that is going to accomplish the goal of ensuring  that they do not develop nuclear weapons.  And right now, we do not have  that confidence. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, real quick, who are you supporting for Speaker of  the House?</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, you know, I -- we need to make sure that we are voting on a  Republican speaker after the elections, so we need to stay focused on the  policy and on our midterms and making sure that we're getting that done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Thanks so much.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ford Motor now pulling all but two of its  passenger cars from its North American line up as part of a plan to save  money and make the company more competitive.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  Stu, a car company canceling all of its  cars?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Well, you know, if you can't make money  selling cars, I guess you forget about selling cars, and you go to light  trucks and SUVs because that's where the money is.  It's a perfectly  rational move but boy, does it come as a shock.  You know, when I think of  the Ford Motor company, I think of the Taurus, one of the best-selling  marks for almost a generation.  It's gone.  They're not going to sell that  thing in North America any longer.  The Fiesta is going.  A couple of other  marks, I guess you'd call them, are going.  I was just shocked to hear  that.  It's a car company, but it's not a car company.  It's now a light  truck and SUV company because it wants to make some more money.  Look at  the stock, up 2-1/2 percent, just because its walking away from the car  market.  I wondered if General Motors will do something similar or FiatChrysler, walk away from unprofitable lines because you got to make money  in this environment and that's what you got to do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's really fascinating.</p><p> VARNEY:  I find it fascinating, I really do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is -- it is fascinating.  And remember the last CEO wanted  to make it a mobility company.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  My, how times change. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  I know you'll have a  lot more on it.  </p><p> VARNEY:  Sure, you will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart.  It is the busiest day of  the earnings season today, G.M. one of the big names out this morning.   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the  numbers.  Nic?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The busiest day  of 68 S&amp;P 500 companies, and to your point, your chat with Stuart, guess  what, G.M. is doing much of the same, focusing on a highly-profitable  pickup trucks, and that's what's costing them going forward for 2018.  So,  for the quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line.  Profit was on  the rise, and it's the high-margin vehicles that they're going to be  working on.  So, 2018, they expect that they will have flat profits but  expect the all new pickup trucks would boost the margins in 2019.  The  stock is down a half of one percent.  </p><p> Then, let's take a look at Starbucks.  So, we're expecting for Starbucks to  report after the bell today.  Global same-store sales are likely on the  rise to the tune of about 1.8 percent.  They still, obviously or have the  P.R. that they have to deal with from Philadelphia, removing those two  black men, but big spot is China.  That's where they see the growth.  In  fact, they're opening one new store in China every 15 hours.  And also, you  can get cold foam on your new -- on your new Starbucks.  All right, Dagen,  back to you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  So, coming up, it's not your average  day.  We are celebrating National Pretzel Day.  Maria's pretzel with a  small business is growing fast.  We take you live to plaza, where there is  a pretzel truck waiting.  I've already eaten one, they're delicious.  We'll  be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you outside on the plaza,  outside headquarters.  What a twist in this National Pretzel Day.  We are  celebrating in style with a small business that is growing fast.  Joining  me right now is Dan Dizio, he's the CEO and co-founder of Philly Pretzel  Factory and we've got the team here ready to munch on all pretzels.  Dan,  great to see you.  </p><p> DAN DIZIO, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY:  Me, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, and I love the MORNINGS WITH  MARIA in pretzel.  That is very cool, nice touch.  You've been selling  pretzels since you're 11 on the corner in Philadelphia.  Tell us how you  started your business.</p><p> DIZIO:  Yes, my next door neighbor had a pretzel bakery, got stuck with a  bunch of pretzels.  I'm 47 now.  This week, I'll be 47.  And he got stuck.   A woman asked if I would sell them on the shoe corner and we would split  the money.  And my mom said it would be OK.  He had to ask my mom  permission, and, for some reasons, my mom said it would be OK to stand on  the street corner all day (INAUDIBLE) but she said it was a different time  back then.  So -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DIZIO:  And, yes, I did it, and did real well, and the next thing I know  every guy was selling pretzels, and did all through middle school and high  school.  And I went to college and was a graduate, and had a stockbroker  job and just didn't like the 9:00 to 5:00 thing, and I want to get back to  the pretzel business and I talked my college roommate into doing a pretzel  business and that's how it started, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You started with the food truck, the Philly Pretzel Factory,  you've got the food truck -- Hi, everybody.  Did you have a pretzel?  Tell  me about the food truck business because this is a really successful way to  sell.</p><p> DIZIO:  Yes, we've had the truck for a few years now.  We're really doing  well with the weddings, bar mitzvahs, just different event.  I mean,  there's different places we could take it, so it'd be mobile.  That's the  way you have to be in this moment right now as for -- be able to  (INAUDIBLE) and be able to bring the pretzel to the people where they are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And now, you have 170 locations across the country.</p><p> DIZIO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're opening more stores.</p><p> DIZIO:  Yes, we're actually opening up 25 in New York right now.  We just  did area development deal to open up 25 in Manhattan over the next few  years.  So, we're excited about that.  And we have about 42 stores under  development.  So, we're really excited.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CASONE:  How long does it take to actually bake a pretzel?</p><p> DIZIO:  It takes about seven minutes to bake a pretzel.  Yes, yes.</p><p> CASONE:  OK.  Some of these.  OK.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CASONE:  And some sausage, am I right?</p><p> DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.</p><p> CASONE:  I'm digging it.</p><p> DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.  (INAUDIBLE) This is a new product we had.  It's  our mini hotdog trade.  We've done really well over the years with hotdog  pretzels.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a mini-hotdog stand.  I like that.</p><p> DIZIO:  And we do many hotdogs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fit for a party. </p><p> DIZIO:  That's exactly what it's meant for.  Tailgating parties.  It's been  a big hit.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the Republican tax plan, did that impact you as a small  business?</p><p> DIZIO:  It actually did.  I mean, more money for the small businesses.   Remember, our franchisees are business owners and there are small  businesses in communities, and to be able to have a tax break for them,  really lets them reinvest, maybe open another location up, reinvest.  I  mean, these are part of the community, these franchise locations.  I mean,  they sponsored the little league.  They have more money to do these things  and it really does have that effect to help everything in their  communities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p> DIZIO:  It's -- we're doing a lot in Midwest, a lot down south.  I mean,  Philadelphia has been haven for pretzels and it is where it all started.   So, we're stretching out, we're in 19 states now and it continues to grow  and people are fascinated and falling in love with the (INAUDIBLE) once we  had --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CASONE:  These are so good, Maria.  We have to get involved.  These are so  good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dan Dizio, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DIZIO:  Thank you.  It's great.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait, can I have the (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  These are just out of the oven.  Stuart Varney,  over to you.  Do you want to have pretzels?</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes.  Delivery, please.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll have it set up for you.</p><p> VARNEY:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Take it away, Stu.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  April 26.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m.  on the East Coast.   Earnings in focus on Wall Street.  Futures indicated to open stronger this  morning.  Stocks are expected to be up at the start of trading with Dow up  55, NASDAQ up 42.  Technology bigwigs, Amazon and Microsoft headlining the  biggest earning season of -- earnings day of the season rather.  This is  the single busiest earnings day of the quarter.  Both are due out after the  bell tonight.  We'll be watching those.  General Motors meanwhile beat  expectations last hour.  The stock is under pressure however over the  automaker's high restructuring expenses, stock down two percent.</p><p>Facebook meanwhile, shaking off the scandal.

Take a look at European  indices this morning after the ECB left interest rates unchanged last hour,  the Ft-100 now changed very much.  The CAC quarante is up about a half of a  percent and the DAX Index up a quarter of a percent.  We are waiting on the  ECB President Mario Draghi to start his news conference, that starts in  about 30 minutes and we'll tell you if there's anything else that he says  that might be market moving.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  Shanghai Composite was the worst performer down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump's pick to head the Department  of Veterans Affairs has pulled his name out of consideration.  The details  as Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination in a growing scrutiny from  lawmakers.  And the West Wing, Kanye not backing down from his support of  President Trump.  The Rapper's powerful message to his critics coming up.   A new robot that's more than meets the eye how scientists in Japan created  a real life transformer.  All of those coming up this morning and joining  me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall  Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman along with  Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth.  Great  to see you guys.  </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And great show so far.  We got a lot on the docket.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Sad story about Ronny Jackson.   This guy has really  served his country honorably and well and this is how Washington treats him  on the way out.  Just horrendous.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that is the news of the moment. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know if he's going to remain the doctor at the White  House but really, he didn't deserve this.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Well, it's a way for some people to try and  discourage from anybody serving in the Trump administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  A way to create chaos in President Trump's  administration.  That is the breaking news.  Dr. Ronny Jackson has  withdrawn as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Blake Burman is  live at the White House with all the details right now.  And Blake, the  news just broke about 10 minutes ago.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.  And Ronny Jackson has put out a  statement within the last few minutes here, Maria.  the bottom line with  this was the allegations just continue to pile and pile up against Dr.  Jackson who is the White House doctor had served under President George W.  Bush, President Obama, and now as the personal doctor as well to President  Trump who nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The  allegations were that he was drinking on the job, overprescribing medicine,  fostering a hostile work environment.  </p><p>Jackson had denied all of that but this morning says he does not want to go  forward with this process.  In a statement Jackson says the following,  \"going into the process, I expected tough questions about how to best care  for our veterans but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and  anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.  </p><p>He goes on to say, \"the allegations against me are completely false and  fabricating.  If they had any merit, I would not have been selected,  promoted, and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as  physician to three Presidents over the past 12 years.\"  The White House  throughout all of this over the last few days continues to stand by  Jackson, there was a Press Secretary Sarah Sanders joining the briefing  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Through Jackson's  record as a White House physician has been impeccable.  In fact because Dr.  Jackson has worked within arm's reach of three Presidents, he has received  more vetting than most nominees.  Given this unique position of trust and  responsibility, Dr. Jackson's background and character were evaluated  during three different administrations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  One thing that keep in mind here, Maria, is before all of these  allegations started rolling in and before the folks up on Capitol Hill put  a temporary pause on the nomination process.  There were serious questions  about whether or not Jackson was qualified to handle such a huge  bureaucracy.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, the President during that  news conference with Emmanuel Macron backed Jackson by saying look, this is  his decision to make, he is a qualified to lead this department and we will  find out from Jackson what he decides to do.  This morning, we have found  out he has pulled his name out from the nomination process and now the  White House has yet another open slot to fill, someone to lead the V.A.   Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that is exactly what the left and the resist movement wants  as much chaos as possible around the Trump administration.  Joining us  right now is Gianno Caldwell, we just saw in the moment.  Gianno, thanks  very much for being here this morning.  Fox News Political Analyst,  Republican strategists, Caldwell strategic consulting founder.  Your  reaction to this.  I mean, obviously, this is more -- booby traps in the  Trump administration.  Who leaked all of this or created this around Dr.  Ronny Jackson forcing him to withdraw in your view? </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  We've seen leaks throughout  this entire start of this administration.  And I think it's very  unfortunate.  Further, I think Sarah Sanders said something that was  particularly interesting and I -- and I thought to be very true that Dr.  Ronny Jackson is an individual who's been vetted by three administrations.   So if these were to be true why wasn't that found to be the case in these  other vetting processes?  So it's something that I think that's obviously  harmful to the Trump administration because we've seen nominees put their  name in and have to withdraw.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  So that particularly problematic.  And I'm sad to see him go but  I know that there are some other good people that can step in his place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  I think an excellent candidate with V.P. to be the new V.A.  secretary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, exact -- well, we talked about that earlier, you're  absolutely right.  But I mean, is -- are the people going to -- going to  come forward and make noise about this?  How is this going to stop with all  of these, you know, booby traps and barriers that the resist movement is  putting in place for the Trump administration? </p><p>HEGSETH:  I think your only option in situation like this is to fight back  and fight back ferociously because it isn't just the leaks, it isn't just  the Obama administration.  Do watch other networks --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The media.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They go wall-to-wall on person speculation, anonymously source  with no verification to smear this guy.  I was forced to watch one of these  other networks yesterday for whatever reason and they didn't stop, it was  all Ronny Jackson, all based on nothing.  Gianno, how do you overcome that  in this environment?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know what, I think that's why it's been President Trump's  best quality.  You saw that through the 2015 election where they would  smear him, they would come at him hard and he wouldn't back down.  And I  think that that President Trump is going to people who love and that's the  reason why he actually won the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And we have to see more of that just that we're going to push  back, we're going to push book no matter what you say and how you try to  smear people because these are legitimately good people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all shaming, it's public shaming.  I'll tell you who  is pushing back, Kanye West.  He's calling it the mob.  Let's talk about  his Make America Great moment.  The rapper face backlash for praising  President Trump yesterday posting on Twitter.  Here's what he said, Kanye  West.  You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob cannot make me not  love him.  We are both dragging energy, he is my brother, I love everyone,  I don't agree with everything anyone does.  That's what makes us  individuals and we have the right to independent thought.  Amen to Kanye  West.  Good for him.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Amen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He goes on to -- and then the President actually responded, and  the President tweeted out, thank you, Kanye.  Very cool.  Gianno, your  reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know, it's interesting.  I'm in my hometown at Chicago right  now and of course this is where Kanye is from.  And I'll be talking about  this on largest urban radio station after this interview but this is I  think excellent.  And I'll tell you why I think it's excellent.  Kanye West  has been an individual who's not willing to back down, he's unrelenting in  what he believes.  And I think that the degree, he really appreciates that  in President Trump more than anything.  </p><p>We saw in the 2016 election as I mentioned before, President Trump did not  back down, whatsoever and I wrote a piece about him in the Hill why the  Republican base (INAUDIBLE) it won't break and he read it and sent me a  note.  And in that piece, I said that the Republicans chose him as the guy  that they wanted to win elections because after the media began to attack  him and he was losing business deals, he lost millions saying what he  believes.  </p><p>He didn't step back like most businessmen would, he didn't step back like  most politicians would, he doubled down on it.  And with that being the  case, then says that I'm unapologetic in my view, I'm unapologetic in  American First policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And I'm unapologetic keeping our country safe.  And I think most  people can appreciate that, most people can evaluate that and most people  voted for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gianno though, it's Dagen.  Never forget, Kanye is always about  Kanye.  Kanye is not about -- he is not -- he is not standing up for any  issue quite frankly, he is doing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a shame.  He's pushing back on shaming, calling them  the mob.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I argue that he is doing it for the attention because he knows  that basically siding with President Trump will get him the most attention.   Going after President Obama will get him the most attention.  He isn't  married to the Kardashian clan after all.  Maybe they're learning from him  rather than the other way around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But this also started after the USA communications  director Candace Owens, she hit back at the Democratic Party and she  defend-- she was Fox last night with Martha.  Listen to how she defended  Kanye and what she said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CANDACE OWENS, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Once they inflate our body's  Democratic Party, let's say they haven't slayed our minds, they have told  true who we must love, who we must hate, what we must think, what ideas are  unacceptable.  In the long run, it just -- it just doesn't add up.  Listen,  I think differently, Kanye West thinks differently.  I can guarantee you if  he and I get in the same room, we will have a lot of disagreements.  The  one thing that we will celebrate is our right to think differently.  I  don't understand what's so controversial for the left to understand this.   The way that they had demonized him in the last 72 hours, it's almost  sickening but at the end of the day it's going to have adverse effects.  I  can guarantee you that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well said, Candace.  Gianno, what do you make of all of this?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  I agree with what Candace has said and I'm going to have to push  back on Dagen just a -- just a bit respectfully.  Kanye is about himself,  that's unquestionable.  I know we all realize that.  However, this is an  individual who definitely has gone against ever since I have known him  before he became a national figure.  The marginalization of thought.   Specifically marginalization of who we are as individuals so often as the  society were programmed.  </p><p>I believe to do what's reasonable and what were pretty much taught in  school and I think he goes beyond that and says look, let's look deep  inside ourselves and fulfill our greatest potential.  And generally  speaking when you do that, when you legitimately do that, it's going to  make people uncomfortable and say, hey what you're doing is unreasonable  and maybe you should rethink your decision but generally speaking the  greatest folks we've seen, Mark Zuckerberg, Kanye West, Donald Trump, the  individuals that really succeeded become these megastars are the ones that  go beyond what's public as a final thought.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.  James Freeman here at the Journal.  I'm not sure why  we're talking about Kanye allegedly being all about himself.  I mean, I  don't know -- I don't know what's in his head but the idea that someone  puts out a message that compliments the President, encourages people to  think freely, and says he loves everyone.  Or why are you saying -- well,  he's about himself?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can ask me that question because I'm the one who said it --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- James because he does -- he does and says things to garner  the most attention.  And so being complimentary in this environment,  President Obama is not going to garner him the most attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he has courage by saying it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to --</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's triggering a very important conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- he -- Kanye West has never lacked courage.  I'm not  arguing that.  I'm just saying that there's always a motive and it is about  -- Kanye is not right or left, not Democrat or Republican, Kanye is Kanye  at the end of the day.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  He has an album that's coming out and he loves --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. The album is coming out.</p><p>CALDWELL:  -- due to his compliments in the President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this -- they shame you if you say anything positive about  the President.  You know, you get shamed online if you say anything  positive about the President.  I like to see somebody, who pushes back  because it's wrong.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And he's is breaking the mode on that, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's breaking --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  Because we've got -- we've gone to an extreme point in time  where you can't say anything complimentary about President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Former FBI Director Jim Comey who's been  trashing the President in every interview and he leaked memos, a catalyst  for the special counsel investigation.  That memo was more wildly shared  than we thought initially.  Sources telling Fox News Comey likely gave the  documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another  person along with the with Columbia Law School professor and watch Comey  struggle to defend his actions last night at a CNN town hall.  Listen to  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  You did leak memos, I mean, is it OK for  somebody at the FBI to leak something, an internal document even if it's  not classified?  Isn't that leaking? </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  It was a whole lot wrong with your  question, Anderson.  First, I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to  communicate the substance of one unclassified </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that  it'd be out in media, I wanted it to get in the media.  As a private  citizen, I could do that and did that just as I have written about it in my  book.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does he think just saying this is going to make people think  otherwise?  We're -- we saw what happened.  Gianno, your reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  That is my definition leaking.  He gave information and now,  this is developing at the harvest of the FBI and he gave it to a friend, to  spring this special counsel and if I -- if I recall correctly, I think it  was reported at The Washington -- Wall Street Journal who said after  reading the Comey memos, there is -- they see no reason why there should  have been a special counsel to begin with.  So with that being the case,  Jim Comey definitely is in a position where he's losing all credibility if  he had any left.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget that zero intelligence that was used  to launch the investigation which Devin Nunes told us about.  Gianno, thank  you.  Good to see you.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Good seeing you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive dragnet in Maine after a man shot and  killed a sheriff's deputy.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, John Williams.  They say that the 29-year-old gunned down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine.  That is just  North of Augusta.  Williams drove the cruiser to a nearby convenience store  and he robbed it.  Police releasing this photo, this captured of him from  inside of the stolen car.  He then abandoned that car nearby, he has not  been seen since.  Deputy Cole had been on the force 13 years. He leaves  behind a son.  The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot at  a Dallas Home Depot, one of them was killed there.  Officer Rogelio  Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him  in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest.  22 officers have  been shot and killed so far this year.  That is more than double from the  same time last year and on average, you're not going to believe this, at  least one officer has reportedly been shot to death every week in 2018.  </p><p>Well, earning season is in high gear this morning.  We're just getting  results from a couple of big airlines, you know, and let's start with  American, the stock is trading lower almost 4-1/2 percent to the downside  in the premarket.  Their first quarter revenue just missed the street  estimate.  Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents actually topped  expectations, not helping out though.  Let's take a look at Southwest, they  also are under pressure ahead of the opening bell down more than 3-1/2  percent.  Revenue coming up short of estimates.  Southwest did add -- the  bookings are down after an engine on its one planes exploded last week  killing a passenger and that was Southwest's first fatality in the  carrier's history.  </p><p>And then finally there's this.  You want to be careful, the next car that  you hop in to might be Megatron.  Japanese engineers created a real life  Transformer that can actually carry people onboard.  This is the first  scene we've ever seen anything like this.  It's a robot car.  It walks over  18 miles an hour and transforms into a sports car with people still inside.   The robot creator says he was yes inspired by his childhood Transformer  heroes that he watched in the movies in growing up.  There you have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, very cool.</p><p>CASONE:  Very cool.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  The outlook on trade with China, big delegation  going next week.  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers will weigh in on the  new report that Chinese companies are already reconsidering investments in  the American market as Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary gets set to  visit his counterpart in China next week.  Then founding partner of  AlphaOne Capital Partners Dan Niles joins me to talk about Facebook's  quarterly results, he predicted the company would beat.  I'll get his take  on the company's surging revenue and where it goes next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Focus on Facebook.  The social media company  beat earnings and revenue expectations last night despite the fallout from  the privacy scandal.  Yesterday, Facebook reported adjusted earnings per  share of $1.69 on revenue of $11.97 billion.  That was the first quarter of  2018.  Shares of Facebook right now are up seven percent in the premarket.   Joining us right now on the telephone is the founding partner of AlphaOne  Capital Partners, Dan Niles.  One of his big positions is Facebook.  And  Dan, good to have you.  Thanks very much for weighing in here.  You  predicted that the company would beat revenue and earnings expectations.   What's your take away from the numbers?</p><p>DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDING PARTNER (via telephone):  I  mean, quite honestly, it's even better than what I was expecting.  You have  to look at the revenues first and revenues year-over-year in the June  quarter were up 45 percent.  And the September and December quarters,  accelerated up 47 percent.  And what's interesting is even with all the  negative publicity around the supposed data scandal, the revenues  accelerates 50 percent year over year in (INAUDIBLE) they keep the  operating income by about 14 percent where their margins were better than  expected and they keep the ETF by over 20 percent.  I mean, back out some  of the one time.  So it's really hard to find a whole lot negative in the  report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about expenses going forward in this whole regulatory  scrutiny?  I mean, are we going to see, you know, new rules regulations  that this company is going to have to adhere to in the entire industry,  we'll have to adhere to that will change the reason to own the stock  because expenses are higher?</p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I really don't think so.  I mean, here is a way to think  about it.  Even though expenses they guided to up 50 to 60 percent,  originally they guided up 45 to 60.  Estimates are actually going up after  this print because they beat the operating income margins by so much that  even though their guiding expenses higher most of the street is actually  raising EPS.  </p><p>The second thing is, I'm sure there will be some extra regulations they  need to adhere to, obviously they talk on the call about the general  protection regulations coming out on May 25th in Europe but the interesting  thing as they said, even with those regulations, they don't anticipate  those changes really significantly impacting our revenue, they do think  daily active users could be cracked down in the second quarter but, you  know, that's really not affecting the revenues.  </p><p>And quite honestly the extra regulations with them, it will -- it will help  make their site a lot safer and to some extent it's going to impact their  smaller competitors a lot more.  They don't have same resources as Facebook  to comply with that. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Hi, Dan.  James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal.  I'd like to  talk about those potential smaller competitors.  Normally those kind of fat  profit margins attract competition.  Who is it that can challenge Facebook,  either among startups or existing tech giants moving into their business. </p><p>NILES:  Well, I mean, you obviously know the list of characters, you've got  Twitter, you've got Snapchat obviously, two public companies talked about  most often.  But I mean, they've been competing since the beginning and  you've obviously seen this market is, you know, not necessarily winner take  post but it's sort evolving that way as Facebook continues to execute and  they're executing really across all of the metrics.  So it's not just  growing revenue but they're highly, highly profitable.  </p><p>They have 46 percent operating marks. And so -- and you have to remember,  to some extent they are a startup in different businesses, so we talked  about Facebook, they've got 2.2 billion users and Instagram 800 million  users, so that's great.  What we don't talk about that much is the 1.3  billion users for Facebook messenger is that they just started to make  money off of and they make absolutely no money off of the 1.5 billion  WhatsApp users.  </p><p>So they've got -- to some extent two startups buried within the company  between Messenger and WhatsApp that they still haven't really started to  monetize yet and that gives me a lot of comfort especially when you look at  the multiples of trading at 20 times non-gap, you know, under 18 earnings.   Markets up 17.  These are growing the top line at 50 percent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The world is wash in venture capital.  Are new competitors being  funded?  And if not, why not?  Is Facebook seen as so dominate that that  won't work? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, I think people are trying to work around the edges  but you have to remember with Facebook, there is something pretty unique  which is the network effect.  You're not going to get off of Facebook and  go to Google plus if your friends aren't there.  So, you can't really  easily switch.  If you're dealing with Google for example and somebody came  out with a much better search engine, you know, there's nothing to stop you  from going to the other one, the problem with this is that even if somebody  didn't develop a great other alternative social media site, you're not  going to move unless all of your friends move too.  And that's probably not  going to happen immediately.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan, real quick.  Intel and Microsoft after the bell tonight,  good quarters?  What are you expecting? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, Intel is one of our largest positions.  We like it  quite a bit.  I think the real key for Intel is enterprise demand has been  really bad for the last couple years.  That really started to improve in  the fourth quarter and I think it's going to be very good for this year.   So we like Intel a lot and it's got a low multiple as well in this  environment at about 14 times.  So we like that quite a bit and Microsoft,  similarly we think they should have a pretty solid quarter.  A multiple is  quite a bit higher at 24 times, so not as preferred to us as Intel. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Dan, always great to talk  with you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>NILES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Dan Niles joining us there.  AlphaOne  Capital.  Coming up.  House Republican Conference chair and Washington  Congressman Cathy McMorris Rogders joins me next. We'll get her take on  French President Macron's state visit with President Trump, trade, and a  lot more.  Then a new twist on coffee just in time for summer.  Starbucks  introducing cold foam before reporting earnings after the bell tonight.  We  break down the expectations.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first-quarter earnings, General Motors and Pepsico among  the companies reporting their first-quarter this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations, while PepsiCo was mixed.  Both stocks are under some selling  pressure this morning by a fraction.  Investors are waiting on big tech.   Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all reporting, after the close tonight, all the  stocks are trading up about two percent right now.  </p><p>Broader markets this morning are higher.  March durable goods just came out  up 2.6 percent versus an estimate of 1.6 percent that was better than  expected.  The news is a positive for markets, and we are seeing a pretty  good tone today.  The Dow Industrials set to open about 50 points, that's a  quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up a third of a percent right now.  And the NASDAQ up 50 points,  that's three-quarters of one percent.  The Dow yesterday snapped a five-day  losing streak.  And the momentum continues today.  That was lifted by  Boeing's big earnings beat.  Boeing's stock did well as did the Dow up 60  points at the close, a quarter of a percent higher.  The S&amp;P was also  fractionally better on the day.  The NASDAQ yesterday, closed lower by  three points.  </p><p>In Europe, this morning, the major indices are higher.  The European  Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, and Mario Draghi is about to  speak in his press conference.  FT-100 up 7-1/2, CAC Quarante up 35, that's  two-thirds of a percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a  percent, 43 points higher.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>President Trump lashing out against Jim Comey.  He's targeting the former  FBI Director on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago.  We will tell you what the  President just told our colleagues there.  And breaking news this morning,  Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination as Secretary of Veterans  Affairs.  President Trump weighed in on the announcement earlier this hour  on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" he placed the blame squarely on Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I even told them a day or  two ago.  I saw this was -- where this was going.  And you know they're  very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again first in his class at West  Point, top in class at Harvard Law School, a brilliant guy, a great guy,  and somebody I get along with very well.  You know, Mike got through and  they thought they had him stopped.  The Democrats are obstructionists.   It's horrible what they're doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Capitol Hill coming up this morning.  And then  just in time for summer, Starbucks added -- adds cold foam.  The details  ahead of the company's earnings report later this hour.  The stock is up,  half of a percent.  Plus, it is National Pretzel Day.  We are celebrating  pretzel day here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Wait until you see this pretzel  that they made of my face.  I don't -- I don't think it looks like me but  let me see if I can grab this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is Pretzel Day.  There you go.  OK, we'll get to that coming  up this morning, but first, our top story right now, President Trump  lashing out at Jim Comey, this morning.  Here's what he had to say about  the fired FBI Director in a new interview this morning with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\"  moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Comey is a leaker and he's a liar.  And not only on this stuff,  he's been leaking for years.  He's probably been using his friend, the so- called professor, who now turns out to have FBI clearance which he never  said.  He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress, he  said he gave it to a friend.  And he gave it to a friend to leak classified  information.  It is all classified, it was totally classified.  So, he  illegally -- he did an illegal act, and he said it himself, in order to get  a special counsel against me. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is House Republican Conference Chair and  Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Good to see you,  Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p>REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R), WASHINGTON, CHAIR, HOUSE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this.  You know, I was actually really struck  by the interview last night that Comey did with CNN, and basically he said,  no, I didn't leak anything but then went on to talk about how, in fact, he  did leak these memos that he wrote which as soon as an FBI Director writes  a memo in FBI, you know, headquarters, that is the property of the FBI, but  he said he passed it on to his friend and told his friend, oh, just get  this to the New York Times but don't actually give them the paper, and he  said that's not leaking.  Your reaction.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, it's -- yes, it begs a lot of questions.  And in someone  who believes it's so important that we are restoring trust, that we're  restoring the rule of law in this country, the FBI is the highest law  enforcement agency.  This is -- the people within the FBI must be held to  the highest standards, and that is what causes me so much dismay right now  is just the cloud that is over the FBI, and the questions that it has  raised.  We need the men and women there to act in the utmost authority, as  well as transparency and accountability to the American people.  And so,  yes, he clearly leaked, and it raises a lot of questions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is there going to be any accountability here,  Congresswoman?  I mean, look, last weekend, I had your colleague,  Congressman Devin Nunes on my Sunday morning program and he said, after  looking at all the electronic communications, he realized that there was no  intelligence used to actually launch an investigation into the Trump  campaign.  So, what happens now?  I mean, can we just keep seeing, you  know, people at the top of these important agencies abuse their power with  no accountability?</p><p>RODGERS:  No one is above the law and they must be held accountable.  And  that's the role of Congress, that's the role of the elected representatives  of the people within the House to make sure that we are taking action to  hold them accountable.  So, both in the Intelligence Committee as well as  the government oversight and reform committee which Trey Gowdy is the  chairman of, that's where these questions are asked and that's where  there's been frustration, that documents have not been turned over, that  people have not been as forthright in answering the questions, but it is up  to us to make sure that people are held accountable and that no one is  above the law. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, we'll be watching what develops then.  Then  there is this, the breaking news this breaking news this morning,  Congresswoman, and that is Dr. Ronny Jackson withdrawing his name for  consideration for the head of the V.A., President Trump's pick to lead the  Department of Veterans Affairs pulled his nomination in the last hour amid  all of these questions surrounding his professional conduct.   Congresswoman, your reaction to this news?</p><p>RODGERS:  I respect his decision.  It's most important that we get someone  at the V.A.  Again, we need to restore trust between the veterans and this  agency whose mission is to serve our veterans.  And as someone who  represents nearly 70,000 veterans in eastern Washington, I hear regularly  from veterans who feel like when they contact the V.A. that they're more of  a burden than actually having the red carpet rolled out for them.  So, we  need someone to head up the V.A., we need to get focused on the mission of  the V.A., and make sure that our veterans, those who have served are  getting the care that they need when the time comes, that has to be a top  priority for us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean, can we just ignore all of the barriers and the  booby traps that the left is putting in place for the Trump administration?   I mean, look at all of the positions that are yet unfilled.  Look at all of  the slow walking going on in terms of getting his nominees passed.  You  know, Mike Pompeo got -- you know, got support, but it was close.  I mean,  what about that, who is doing this?  We know that three administrations  have said how great Dr. Ronny Jackson is and all of a sudden, somebody  leaks all of this speculation about his personal life.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, that is -- yes, that's tough to see, and I respect his  decision just to pull out.  I am concerned that the left is putting  politics ahead of what's best for the country, and there's so many --  there's the V.A. position, Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, he's an  honorable man, a well-respected leader, he's proven himself, and yet too  many were willing to put politics ahead of what was best for the country.   We do need to get these people in place because that is part of making sure  that President Trump has the people around him to actually lead, and people  equal policy and he needs these people in place so that we can keep moving  forward.  There's a lot on our plate right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think people are figuring this out, that there's -- all of  these booby traps that are being put in by the skeptics and critics of  President Trump.  And then there's China, of course, reportedly threatening  to \"fierce counterstrike\" if the President goes ahead with these another  $100 billion in tariffs as punishment for the alleged intellectual property  theft.  Congressman, your thoughts on this.  I know Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary and a whole delegation are going next week to meet with  their counterparts in China to talk this out.</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, there's too many examples of illegal practices by  China, where we have seen them taking our intellectual property and  duplicating it.  I have examples in Eastern Washington, Washington State,  and it destroys companies here in America.  I am encouraged that President  Trump is focused on making sure that we hold China accountable.  I have had  concerns about the across-the-board approach to tariffs that, you know, he  was talking about imposing upon steel and aluminum.  I do believe it needs  to be more targeted but we must hold a country like China accountable for  illegal practices or free and fair trade will never work. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bottom line, do you think that the President with his tough  talk and the team is going to be able to account that budget deficit with  China, which is already now up to 375 billion?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, if anyone can do it, I believe it's President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes,</p><p>RODGERS:  And he is focused on this.  I had the chance to spend some time  with Larry Kudlow just last week.  I'm really pleased to see him as the  head of the economic advisors, his chief economic adviser.  He understands  economics, world trade, and also what's going on in China.  And he  basically told us everything is on the table, tariffs, no tariffs,  sanctions, but we must hold them accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's going to be on that trip as well, Larry Kudlow, and  Peter Navarro.  What about this budget about face, Congresswoman?   President Trump is now urging lawmakers to rescind some of the spending of  that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill which he signed last month.   Congresswoman, are there enough votes to make it happen and obviously you  must be getting just as much pushback as so many others are, for signing  that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill with all the spending?</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, we must address the spending in this country.  It  is the number one threat that faces us, both from a military perspective as  well as economic perspective, we needed to get a budget in place, but it  spends too much, and that's where I am -- I'm actually encouraged that the  President, Mick Mulvaney is leading on putting together a rescission  package.  </p><p>We should have been doing this all along, really taking a look at those  opportunities to go into programs, go into agencies and actually through  the House and the Senate, cut the spending.  The budget process is broken,  the House passed all 12 of our appropriations bills.  We went through  program by program, agency by agency, the Senate did zero.  So, this has  been very frustrating.  </p><p>This is our fundamental job as the elected representatives, this is where  we exercise the power of the purse, and yet this process is broken.  So, I  am -- I definitely want to look at what the President -- what they can  propose.  I think the House and Senate should also be using this tool of  rescissions to take action that we can to reduce those deficits and reduce  the debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his three-day  state visit with an address to the joint meeting of Congress.  How was it,  what was your takeaway?  He was critical of the President's planned  withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, I think, it is important that these conversations continue.   I've never been a supporter of the Iran deal.  I thought it was bad deal.   It did not hold Iran accountable for not developing or obtaining nuclear  weapons.  And that's where we need our European allies to join us in making  sure that we have a deal that is going to accomplish the goal of ensuring  that they do not develop nuclear weapons.  And right now, we do not have  that confidence. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, real quick, who are you supporting for Speaker of  the House?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, you know, I -- we need to make sure that we are voting on a  Republican speaker after the elections, so we need to stay focused on the  policy and on our midterms and making sure that we're getting that done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Thanks so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ford Motor now pulling all but two of its  passenger cars from its North American line up as part of a plan to save  money and make the company more competitive.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  Stu, a car company canceling all of its  cars?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Well, you know, if you can't make money  selling cars, I guess you forget about selling cars, and you go to light  trucks and SUVs because that's where the money is.  It's a perfectly  rational move but boy, does it come as a shock.  You know, when I think of  the Ford Motor company, I think of the Taurus, one of the best-selling  marks for almost a generation.  It's gone.  They're not going to sell that  thing in North America any longer.  The Fiesta is going.  A couple of other  marks, I guess you'd call them, are going.  I was just shocked to hear  that.  It's a car company, but it's not a car company.  It's now a light  truck and SUV company because it wants to make some more money.  Look at  the stock, up 2-1/2 percent, just because its walking away from the car  market.  I wondered if General Motors will do something similar or FiatChrysler, walk away from unprofitable lines because you got to make money  in this environment and that's what you got to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really fascinating.</p><p>VARNEY:  I find it fascinating, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is -- it is fascinating.  And remember the last CEO wanted  to make it a mobility company.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  My, how times change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  I know you'll have a  lot more on it.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Sure, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart.  It is the busiest day of  the earnings season today, G.M. one of the big names out this morning.   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the  numbers.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The busiest day  of 68 S&amp;P 500 companies, and to your point, your chat with Stuart, guess  what, G.M. is doing much of the same, focusing on a highly-profitable  pickup trucks, and that's what's costing them going forward for 2018.  So,  for the quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line.  Profit was on  the rise, and it's the high-margin vehicles that they're going to be  working on.  So, 2018, they expect that they will have flat profits but  expect the all new pickup trucks would boost the margins in 2019.  The  stock is down a half of one percent.  </p><p>Then, let's take a look at Starbucks.  So, we're expecting for Starbucks to  report after the bell today.  Global same-store sales are likely on the  rise to the tune of about 1.8 percent.  They still, obviously or have the  P.R. that they have to deal with from Philadelphia, removing those two  black men, but big spot is China.  That's where they see the growth.  In  fact, they're opening one new store in China every 15 hours.  And also, you  can get cold foam on your new -- on your new Starbucks.  All right, Dagen,  back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  So, coming up, it's not your average  day.  We are celebrating National Pretzel Day.  Maria's pretzel with a  small business is growing fast.  We take you live to plaza, where there is  a pretzel truck waiting.  I've already eaten one, they're delicious.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you outside on the plaza,  outside headquarters.  What a twist in this National Pretzel Day.  We are  celebrating in style with a small business that is growing fast.  Joining  me right now is Dan Dizio, he's the CEO and co-founder of Philly Pretzel  Factory and we've got the team here ready to munch on all pretzels.  Dan,  great to see you.  </p><p>DAN DIZIO, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY:  Me, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, and I love the MORNINGS WITH  MARIA in pretzel.  That is very cool, nice touch.  You've been selling  pretzels since you're 11 on the corner in Philadelphia.  Tell us how you  started your business.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, my next door neighbor had a pretzel bakery, got stuck with a  bunch of pretzels.  I'm 47 now.  This week, I'll be 47.  And he got stuck.   A woman asked if I would sell them on the shoe corner and we would split  the money.  And my mom said it would be OK.  He had to ask my mom  permission, and, for some reasons, my mom said it would be OK to stand on  the street corner all day (INAUDIBLE) but she said it was a different time  back then.  So -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  And, yes, I did it, and did real well, and the next thing I know  every guy was selling pretzels, and did all through middle school and high  school.  And I went to college and was a graduate, and had a stockbroker  job and just didn't like the 9:00 to 5:00 thing, and I want to get back to  the pretzel business and I talked my college roommate into doing a pretzel  business and that's how it started, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You started with the food truck, the Philly Pretzel Factory,  you've got the food truck -- Hi, everybody.  Did you have a pretzel?  Tell  me about the food truck business because this is a really successful way to  sell.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we've had the truck for a few years now.  We're really doing  well with the weddings, bar mitzvahs, just different event.  I mean,  there's different places we could take it, so it'd be mobile.  That's the  way you have to be in this moment right now as for -- be able to  (INAUDIBLE) and be able to bring the pretzel to the people where they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, you have 170 locations across the country.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're opening more stores.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we're actually opening up 25 in New York right now.  We just  did area development deal to open up 25 in Manhattan over the next few  years.  So, we're excited about that.  And we have about 42 stores under  development.  So, we're really excited.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  How long does it take to actually bake a pretzel?</p><p>DIZIO:  It takes about seven minutes to bake a pretzel.  Yes, yes.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  Some of these.  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  And some sausage, am I right?</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm digging it.</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.  (INAUDIBLE) This is a new product we had.  It's  our mini hotdog trade.  We've done really well over the years with hotdog  pretzels.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a mini-hotdog stand.  I like that.</p><p>DIZIO:  And we do many hotdogs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fit for a party. </p><p>DIZIO:  That's exactly what it's meant for.  Tailgating parties.  It's been  a big hit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the Republican tax plan, did that impact you as a small  business?</p><p>DIZIO:  It actually did.  I mean, more money for the small businesses.   Remember, our franchisees are business owners and there are small  businesses in communities, and to be able to have a tax break for them,  really lets them reinvest, maybe open another location up, reinvest.  I  mean, these are part of the community, these franchise locations.  I mean,  they sponsored the little league.  They have more money to do these things  and it really does have that effect to help everything in their  communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p>DIZIO:  It's -- we're doing a lot in Midwest, a lot down south.  I mean,  Philadelphia has been haven for pretzels and it is where it all started.   So, we're stretching out, we're in 19 states now and it continues to grow  and people are fascinated and falling in love with the (INAUDIBLE) once we  had --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  These are so good, Maria.  We have to get involved.  These are so  good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan Dizio, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  Thank you.  It's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait, can I have the (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  These are just out of the oven.  Stuart Varney,  over to you.  Do you want to have pretzels?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Delivery, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll have it set up for you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take it away, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The details  as Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination in a growing scrutiny from  lawmakers.  And the West Wing, Kanye not backing down from his support of  President Trump.  The Rapper's powerful message to his critics coming up.   A new robot that's more than meets the eye how scientists in Japan created  a real life transformer.  All of those coming up this morning and joining  me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall  Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman along with  Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth.  Great  to see you guys.  </p><p> PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And great show so far.  We got a lot on the docket.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Sad story about Ronny Jackson.   This guy has really  served his country honorably and well and this is how Washington treats him  on the way out.  Just horrendous.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that is the news of the moment. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't know if he's going to remain the doctor at the White  House but really, he didn't deserve this.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Well, it's a way for some people to try and  discourage from anybody serving in the Trump administration.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  A way to create chaos in President Trump's  administration.  That is the breaking news.  Dr. Ronny Jackson has  withdrawn as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Blake Burman is  live at the White House with all the details right now.  And Blake, the  news just broke about 10 minutes ago.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.  And Ronny Jackson has put out a  statement within the last few minutes here, Maria.  the bottom line with  this was the allegations just continue to pile and pile up against Dr.  Jackson who is the White House doctor had served under President George W.  Bush, President Obama, and now as the personal doctor as well to President  Trump who nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The  allegations were that he was drinking on the job, overprescribing medicine,  fostering a hostile work environment.  </p><p> Jackson had denied all of that but this morning says he does not want to go  forward with this process.  In a statement Jackson says the following,  \"going into the process, I expected tough questions about how to best care  for our veterans but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and  anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.  </p><p> He goes on to say, \"the allegations against me are completely false and  fabricating.  If they had any merit, I would not have been selected,  promoted, and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as  physician to three Presidents over the past 12 years.\"  The White House  throughout all of this over the last few days continues to stand by  Jackson, there was a Press Secretary Sarah Sanders joining the briefing  yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Through Jackson's  record as a White House physician has been impeccable.  In fact because Dr.  Jackson has worked within arm's reach of three Presidents, he has received  more vetting than most nominees.  Given this unique position of trust and  responsibility, Dr. Jackson's background and character were evaluated  during three different administrations.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  One thing that keep in mind here, Maria, is before all of these  allegations started rolling in and before the folks up on Capitol Hill put  a temporary pause on the nomination process.  There were serious questions  about whether or not Jackson was qualified to handle such a huge  bureaucracy.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, the President during that  news conference with Emmanuel Macron backed Jackson by saying look, this is  his decision to make, he is a qualified to lead this department and we will  find out from Jackson what he decides to do.  This morning, we have found  out he has pulled his name out from the nomination process and now the  White House has yet another open slot to fill, someone to lead the V.A.   Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that is exactly what the left and the resist movement wants  as much chaos as possible around the Trump administration.  Joining us  right now is Gianno Caldwell, we just saw in the moment.  Gianno, thanks  very much for being here this morning.  Fox News Political Analyst,  Republican strategists, Caldwell strategic consulting founder.  Your  reaction to this.  I mean, obviously, this is more -- booby traps in the  Trump administration.  Who leaked all of this or created this around Dr.  Ronny Jackson forcing him to withdraw in your view? </p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  We've seen leaks throughout  this entire start of this administration.  And I think it's very  unfortunate.  Further, I think Sarah Sanders said something that was  particularly interesting and I -- and I thought to be very true that Dr.  Ronny Jackson is an individual who's been vetted by three administrations.   So if these were to be true why wasn't that found to be the case in these  other vetting processes?  So it's something that I think that's obviously  harmful to the Trump administration because we've seen nominees put their  name in and have to withdraw.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> CALDWELL:  So that particularly problematic.  And I'm sad to see him go but  I know that there are some other good people that can step in his place.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> CALDWELL:  I think an excellent candidate with V.P. to be the new V.A.  secretary.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, exact -- well, we talked about that earlier, you're  absolutely right.  But I mean, is -- are the people going to -- going to  come forward and make noise about this?  How is this going to stop with all  of these, you know, booby traps and barriers that the resist movement is  putting in place for the Trump administration? </p><p> HEGSETH:  I think your only option in situation like this is to fight back  and fight back ferociously because it isn't just the leaks, it isn't just  the Obama administration.  Do watch other networks --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The media.</p><p> HEGSETH:  They go wall-to-wall on person speculation, anonymously source  with no verification to smear this guy.  I was forced to watch one of these  other networks yesterday for whatever reason and they didn't stop, it was  all Ronny Jackson, all based on nothing.  Gianno, how do you overcome that  in this environment?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  You know what, I think that's why it's been President Trump's  best quality.  You saw that through the 2015 election where they would  smear him, they would come at him hard and he wouldn't back down.  And I  think that that President Trump is going to people who love and that's the  reason why he actually won the election.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CALDWELL:  And we have to see more of that just that we're going to push  back, we're going to push book no matter what you say and how you try to  smear people because these are legitimately good people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's all shaming, it's public shaming.  I'll tell you who  is pushing back, Kanye West.  He's calling it the mob.  Let's talk about  his Make America Great moment.  The rapper face backlash for praising  President Trump yesterday posting on Twitter.  Here's what he said, Kanye  West.  You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob cannot make me not  love him.  We are both dragging energy, he is my brother, I love everyone,  I don't agree with everything anyone does.  That's what makes us  individuals and we have the right to independent thought.  Amen to Kanye  West.  Good for him.</p><p> CALDWELL:  Amen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He goes on to -- and then the President actually responded, and  the President tweeted out, thank you, Kanye.  Very cool.  Gianno, your  reaction.  </p><p> CALDWELL:  You know, it's interesting.  I'm in my hometown at Chicago right  now and of course this is where Kanye is from.  And I'll be talking about  this on largest urban radio station after this interview but this is I  think excellent.  And I'll tell you why I think it's excellent.  Kanye West  has been an individual who's not willing to back down, he's unrelenting in  what he believes.  And I think that the degree, he really appreciates that  in President Trump more than anything.  </p><p> We saw in the 2016 election as I mentioned before, President Trump did not  back down, whatsoever and I wrote a piece about him in the Hill why the  Republican base (INAUDIBLE) it won't break and he read it and sent me a  note.  And in that piece, I said that the Republicans chose him as the guy  that they wanted to win elections because after the media began to attack  him and he was losing business deals, he lost millions saying what he  believes.  </p><p> He didn't step back like most businessmen would, he didn't step back like  most politicians would, he doubled down on it.  And with that being the  case, then says that I'm unapologetic in my view, I'm unapologetic in  American First policies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CALDWELL:  And I'm unapologetic keeping our country safe.  And I think most  people can appreciate that, most people can evaluate that and most people  voted for that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Gianno though, it's Dagen.  Never forget, Kanye is always about  Kanye.  Kanye is not about -- he is not -- he is not standing up for any  issue quite frankly, he is doing -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a shame.  He's pushing back on shaming, calling them  the mob.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I argue that he is doing it for the attention because he knows  that basically siding with President Trump will get him the most attention.   Going after President Obama will get him the most attention.  He isn't  married to the Kardashian clan after all.  Maybe they're learning from him  rather than the other way around.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But this also started after the USA communications  director Candace Owens, she hit back at the Democratic Party and she  defend-- she was Fox last night with Martha.  Listen to how she defended  Kanye and what she said.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CANDACE OWENS, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Once they inflate our body's  Democratic Party, let's say they haven't slayed our minds, they have told  true who we must love, who we must hate, what we must think, what ideas are  unacceptable.  In the long run, it just -- it just doesn't add up.  Listen,  I think differently, Kanye West thinks differently.  I can guarantee you if  he and I get in the same room, we will have a lot of disagreements.  The  one thing that we will celebrate is our right to think differently.  I  don't understand what's so controversial for the left to understand this.   The way that they had demonized him in the last 72 hours, it's almost  sickening but at the end of the day it's going to have adverse effects.  I  can guarantee you that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well said, Candace.  Gianno, what do you make of all of this?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  I agree with what Candace has said and I'm going to have to push  back on Dagen just a -- just a bit respectfully.  Kanye is about himself,  that's unquestionable.  I know we all realize that.  However, this is an  individual who definitely has gone against ever since I have known him  before he became a national figure.  The marginalization of thought.   Specifically marginalization of who we are as individuals so often as the  society were programmed.  </p><p> I believe to do what's reasonable and what were pretty much taught in  school and I think he goes beyond that and says look, let's look deep  inside ourselves and fulfill our greatest potential.  And generally  speaking when you do that, when you legitimately do that, it's going to  make people uncomfortable and say, hey what you're doing is unreasonable  and maybe you should rethink your decision but generally speaking the  greatest folks we've seen, Mark Zuckerberg, Kanye West, Donald Trump, the  individuals that really succeeded become these megastars are the ones that  go beyond what's public as a final thought.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  All right.  James Freeman here at the Journal.  I'm not sure why  we're talking about Kanye allegedly being all about himself.  I mean, I  don't know -- I don't know what's in his head but the idea that someone  puts out a message that compliments the President, encourages people to  think freely, and says he loves everyone.  Or why are you saying -- well,  he's about himself?</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can ask me that question because I'm the one who said it --</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- James because he does -- he does and says things to garner  the most attention.  And so being complimentary in this environment,  President Obama is not going to garner him the most attention.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But I'm not going to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think he has courage by saying it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He has to --</p><p> FREEMAN:  It's triggering a very important conversation.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But -- he -- Kanye West has never lacked courage.  I'm not  arguing that.  I'm just saying that there's always a motive and it is about  -- Kanye is not right or left, not Democrat or Republican, Kanye is Kanye  at the end of the day.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CALDWELL:  He has an album that's coming out and he loves --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right. The album is coming out.</p><p> CALDWELL:  -- due to his compliments in the President.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, this -- they shame you if you say anything positive about  the President.  You know, you get shamed online if you say anything  positive about the President.  I like to see somebody, who pushes back  because it's wrong.  </p><p> CALDWELL:  And he's is breaking the mode on that, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's breaking --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CALDWELL:  Because we've got -- we've gone to an extreme point in time  where you can't say anything complimentary about President Trump.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then there's Former FBI Director Jim Comey who's been  trashing the President in every interview and he leaked memos, a catalyst  for the special counsel investigation.  That memo was more wildly shared  than we thought initially.  Sources telling Fox News Comey likely gave the  documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another  person along with the with Columbia Law School professor and watch Comey  struggle to defend his actions last night at a CNN town hall.  Listen to  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  You did leak memos, I mean, is it OK for  somebody at the FBI to leak something, an internal document even if it's  not classified?  Isn't that leaking? </p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  It was a whole lot wrong with your  question, Anderson.  First, I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to  communicate the substance of one unclassified </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that  it'd be out in media, I wanted it to get in the media.  As a private  citizen, I could do that and did that just as I have written about it in my  book.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Does he think just saying this is going to make people think  otherwise?  We're -- we saw what happened.  Gianno, your reaction.  </p><p> CALDWELL:  That is my definition leaking.  He gave information and now,  this is developing at the harvest of the FBI and he gave it to a friend, to  spring this special counsel and if I -- if I recall correctly, I think it  was reported at The Washington -- Wall Street Journal who said after  reading the Comey memos, there is -- they see no reason why there should  have been a special counsel to begin with.  So with that being the case,  Jim Comey definitely is in a position where he's losing all credibility if  he had any left.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget that zero intelligence that was used  to launch the investigation which Devin Nunes told us about.  Gianno, thank  you.  Good to see you.</p><p> CALDWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p> CALDWELL:  Good seeing you.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive dragnet in Maine after a man shot and  killed a sheriff's deputy.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, John Williams.  They say that the 29-year-old gunned down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine.  That is just  North of Augusta.  Williams drove the cruiser to a nearby convenience store  and he robbed it.  Police releasing this photo, this captured of him from  inside of the stolen car.  He then abandoned that car nearby, he has not  been seen since.  Deputy Cole had been on the force 13 years. He leaves  behind a son.  The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot at  a Dallas Home Depot, one of them was killed there.  Officer Rogelio  Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him  in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest.  22 officers have  been shot and killed so far this year.  That is more than double from the  same time last year and on average, you're not going to believe this, at  least one officer has reportedly been shot to death every week in 2018.  </p><p> Well, earning season is in high gear this morning.  We're just getting  results from a couple of big airlines, you know, and let's start with  American, the stock is trading lower almost 4-1/2 percent to the downside  in the premarket.  Their first quarter revenue just missed the street  estimate.  Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents actually topped  expectations, not helping out though.  Let's take a look at Southwest, they  also are under pressure ahead of the opening bell down more than 3-1/2  percent.  Revenue coming up short of estimates.  Southwest did add -- the  bookings are down after an engine on its one planes exploded last week  killing a passenger and that was Southwest's first fatality in the  carrier's history.  </p><p> And then finally there's this.  You want to be careful, the next car that  you hop in to might be Megatron.  Japanese engineers created a real life  Transformer that can actually carry people onboard.  This is the first  scene we've ever seen anything like this.  It's a robot car.  It walks over  18 miles an hour and transforms into a sports car with people still inside.   The robot creator says he was yes inspired by his childhood Transformer  heroes that he watched in the movies in growing up.  There you have it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, very cool.</p><p> CASONE:  Very cool.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  The outlook on trade with China, big delegation  going next week.  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers will weigh in on the  new report that Chinese companies are already reconsidering investments in  the American market as Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary gets set to  visit his counterpart in China next week.  Then founding partner of  AlphaOne Capital Partners Dan Niles joins me to talk about Facebook's  quarterly results, he predicted the company would beat.  I'll get his take  on the company's surging revenue and where it goes next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Focus on Facebook.  The social media company  beat earnings and revenue expectations last night despite the fallout from  the privacy scandal.  Yesterday, Facebook reported adjusted earnings per  share of $1.69 on revenue of $11.97 billion.  That was the first quarter of  2018.  Shares of Facebook right now are up seven percent in the premarket.   Joining us right now on the telephone is the founding partner of AlphaOne  Capital Partners, Dan Niles.  One of his big positions is Facebook.  And  Dan, good to have you.  Thanks very much for weighing in here.  You  predicted that the company would beat revenue and earnings expectations.   What's your take away from the numbers?</p><p> DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDING PARTNER (via telephone):  I  mean, quite honestly, it's even better than what I was expecting.  You have  to look at the revenues first and revenues year-over-year in the June  quarter were up 45 percent.  And the September and December quarters,  accelerated up 47 percent.  And what's interesting is even with all the  negative publicity around the supposed data scandal, the revenues  accelerates 50 percent year over year in (INAUDIBLE) they keep the  operating income by about 14 percent where their margins were better than  expected and they keep the ETF by over 20 percent.  I mean, back out some  of the one time.  So it's really hard to find a whole lot negative in the  report. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about expenses going forward in this whole regulatory  scrutiny?  I mean, are we going to see, you know, new rules regulations  that this company is going to have to adhere to in the entire industry,  we'll have to adhere to that will change the reason to own the stock  because expenses are higher?</p><p> NILES:  Yes.  I really don't think so.  I mean, here is a way to think  about it.  Even though expenses they guided to up 50 to 60 percent,  originally they guided up 45 to 60.  Estimates are actually going up after  this print because they beat the operating income margins by so much that  even though their guiding expenses higher most of the street is actually  raising EPS.  </p><p> The second thing is, I'm sure there will be some extra regulations they  need to adhere to, obviously they talk on the call about the general  protection regulations coming out on May 25th in Europe but the interesting  thing as they said, even with those regulations, they don't anticipate  those changes really significantly impacting our revenue, they do think  daily active users could be cracked down in the second quarter but, you  know, that's really not affecting the revenues.  </p><p> And quite honestly the extra regulations with them, it will -- it will help  make their site a lot safer and to some extent it's going to impact their  smaller competitors a lot more.  They don't have same resources as Facebook  to comply with that. </p><p> FREEMAN:  Hi, Dan.  James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal.  I'd like to  talk about those potential smaller competitors.  Normally those kind of fat  profit margins attract competition.  Who is it that can challenge Facebook,  either among startups or existing tech giants moving into their business. </p><p> NILES:  Well, I mean, you obviously know the list of characters, you've got  Twitter, you've got Snapchat obviously, two public companies talked about  most often.  But I mean, they've been competing since the beginning and  you've obviously seen this market is, you know, not necessarily winner take  post but it's sort evolving that way as Facebook continues to execute and  they're executing really across all of the metrics.  So it's not just  growing revenue but they're highly, highly profitable.  </p><p> They have 46 percent operating marks. And so -- and you have to remember,  to some extent they are a startup in different businesses, so we talked  about Facebook, they've got 2.2 billion users and Instagram 800 million  users, so that's great.  What we don't talk about that much is the 1.3  billion users for Facebook messenger is that they just started to make  money off of and they make absolutely no money off of the 1.5 billion  WhatsApp users.  </p><p> So they've got -- to some extent two startups buried within the company  between Messenger and WhatsApp that they still haven't really started to  monetize yet and that gives me a lot of comfort especially when you look at  the multiples of trading at 20 times non-gap, you know, under 18 earnings.   Markets up 17.  These are growing the top line at 50 percent. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FREEMAN:  I'm sorry.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  The world is wash in venture capital.  Are new competitors being  funded?  And if not, why not?  Is Facebook seen as so dominate that that  won't work? </p><p> NILES:  Yes.  I mean, I think people are trying to work around the edges  but you have to remember with Facebook, there is something pretty unique  which is the network effect.  You're not going to get off of Facebook and  go to Google plus if your friends aren't there.  So, you can't really  easily switch.  If you're dealing with Google for example and somebody came  out with a much better search engine, you know, there's nothing to stop you  from going to the other one, the problem with this is that even if somebody  didn't develop a great other alternative social media site, you're not  going to move unless all of your friends move too.  And that's probably not  going to happen immediately.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dan, real quick.  Intel and Microsoft after the bell tonight,  good quarters?  What are you expecting? </p><p> NILES:  Yes.  I mean, Intel is one of our largest positions.  We like it  quite a bit.  I think the real key for Intel is enterprise demand has been  really bad for the last couple years.  That really started to improve in  the fourth quarter and I think it's going to be very good for this year.   So we like Intel a lot and it's got a low multiple as well in this  environment at about 14 times.  So we like that quite a bit and Microsoft,  similarly we think they should have a pretty solid quarter.  A multiple is  quite a bit higher at 24 times, so not as preferred to us as Intel. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Dan, always great to talk  with you.  Thanks so much.</p><p> NILES:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Dan Niles joining us there.  AlphaOne  Capital.  Coming up.  House Republican Conference chair and Washington  Congressman Cathy McMorris Rogders joins me next. We'll get her take on  French President Macron's state visit with President Trump, trade, and a  lot more.  Then a new twist on coffee just in time for summer.  Starbucks  introducing cold foam before reporting earnings after the bell tonight.  We  break down the expectations.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first-quarter earnings, General Motors and Pepsico among  the companies reporting their first-quarter this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations, while PepsiCo was mixed.  Both stocks are under some selling  pressure this morning by a fraction.  Investors are waiting on big tech.   Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all reporting, after the close tonight, all the  stocks are trading up about two percent right now.  </p><p> Broader markets this morning are higher.  March durable goods just came out  up 2.6 percent versus an estimate of 1.6 percent that was better than  expected.  The news is a positive for markets, and we are seeing a pretty  good tone today.  The Dow Industrials set to open about 50 points, that's a  quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p> The S&amp;P is up a third of a percent right now.  And the NASDAQ up 50 points,  that's three-quarters of one percent.  The Dow yesterday snapped a five-day  losing streak.  And the momentum continues today.  That was lifted by  Boeing's big earnings beat.  Boeing's stock did well as did the Dow up 60  points at the close, a quarter of a percent higher.  The S&amp;P was also  fractionally better on the day.  The NASDAQ yesterday, closed lower by  three points.  </p><p> In Europe, this morning, the major indices are higher.  The European  Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, and Mario Draghi is about to  speak in his press conference.  FT-100 up 7-1/2, CAC Quarante up 35, that's  two-thirds of a percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a  percent, 43 points higher.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p> President Trump lashing out against Jim Comey.  He's targeting the former  FBI Director on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago.  We will tell you what the  President just told our colleagues there.  And breaking news this morning,  Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination as Secretary of Veterans  Affairs.  President Trump weighed in on the announcement earlier this hour  on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" he placed the blame squarely on Democrats.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I even told them a day or  two ago.  I saw this was -- where this was going.  And you know they're  very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again first in his class at West  Point, top in class at Harvard Law School, a brilliant guy, a great guy,  and somebody I get along with very well.  You know, Mike got through and  they thought they had him stopped.  The Democrats are obstructionists.   It's horrible what they're doing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Capitol Hill coming up this morning.  And then  just in time for summer, Starbucks added -- adds cold foam.  The details  ahead of the company's earnings report later this hour.  The stock is up,  half of a percent.  Plus, it is National Pretzel Day.  We are celebrating  pretzel day here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Wait until you see this pretzel  that they made of my face.  I don't -- I don't think it looks like me but  let me see if I can grab this.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is Pretzel Day.  There you go.  OK, we'll get to that coming  up this morning, but first, our top story right now, President Trump  lashing out at Jim Comey, this morning.  Here's what he had to say about  the fired FBI Director in a new interview this morning with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\"  moments ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  Comey is a leaker and he's a liar.  And not only on this stuff,  he's been leaking for years.  He's probably been using his friend, the so- called professor, who now turns out to have FBI clearance which he never  said.  He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress, he  said he gave it to a friend.  And he gave it to a friend to leak classified  information.  It is all classified, it was totally classified.  So, he  illegally -- he did an illegal act, and he said it himself, in order to get  a special counsel against me. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is House Republican Conference Chair and  Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Good to see you,  Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p> REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R), WASHINGTON, CHAIR, HOUSE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE:  Good to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this.  You know, I was actually really struck  by the interview last night that Comey did with CNN, and basically he said,  no, I didn't leak anything but then went on to talk about how, in fact, he  did leak these memos that he wrote which as soon as an FBI Director writes  a memo in FBI, you know, headquarters, that is the property of the FBI, but  he said he passed it on to his friend and told his friend, oh, just get  this to the New York Times but don't actually give them the paper, and he  said that's not leaking.  Your reaction.</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, it's -- yes, it begs a lot of questions.  And in someone  who believes it's so important that we are restoring trust, that we're  restoring the rule of law in this country, the FBI is the highest law  enforcement agency.  This is -- the people within the FBI must be held to  the highest standards, and that is what causes me so much dismay right now  is just the cloud that is over the FBI, and the questions that it has  raised.  We need the men and women there to act in the utmost authority, as  well as transparency and accountability to the American people.  And so,  yes, he clearly leaked, and it raises a lot of questions.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But is there going to be any accountability here,  Congresswoman?  I mean, look, last weekend, I had your colleague,  Congressman Devin Nunes on my Sunday morning program and he said, after  looking at all the electronic communications, he realized that there was no  intelligence used to actually launch an investigation into the Trump  campaign.  So, what happens now?  I mean, can we just keep seeing, you  know, people at the top of these important agencies abuse their power with  no accountability?</p><p> RODGERS:  No one is above the law and they must be held accountable.  And  that's the role of Congress, that's the role of the elected representatives  of the people within the House to make sure that we are taking action to  hold them accountable.  So, both in the Intelligence Committee as well as  the government oversight and reform committee which Trey Gowdy is the  chairman of, that's where these questions are asked and that's where  there's been frustration, that documents have not been turned over, that  people have not been as forthright in answering the questions, but it is up  to us to make sure that people are held accountable and that no one is  above the law. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, we'll be watching what develops then.  Then  there is this, the breaking news this breaking news this morning,  Congresswoman, and that is Dr. Ronny Jackson withdrawing his name for  consideration for the head of the V.A., President Trump's pick to lead the  Department of Veterans Affairs pulled his nomination in the last hour amid  all of these questions surrounding his professional conduct.   Congresswoman, your reaction to this news?</p><p> RODGERS:  I respect his decision.  It's most important that we get someone  at the V.A.  Again, we need to restore trust between the veterans and this  agency whose mission is to serve our veterans.  And as someone who  represents nearly 70,000 veterans in eastern Washington, I hear regularly  from veterans who feel like when they contact the V.A. that they're more of  a burden than actually having the red carpet rolled out for them.  So, we  need someone to head up the V.A., we need to get focused on the mission of  the V.A., and make sure that our veterans, those who have served are  getting the care that they need when the time comes, that has to be a top  priority for us. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But I mean, can we just ignore all of the barriers and the  booby traps that the left is putting in place for the Trump administration?   I mean, look at all of the positions that are yet unfilled.  Look at all of  the slow walking going on in terms of getting his nominees passed.  You  know, Mike Pompeo got -- you know, got support, but it was close.  I mean,  what about that, who is doing this?  We know that three administrations  have said how great Dr. Ronny Jackson is and all of a sudden, somebody  leaks all of this speculation about his personal life.</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, that is -- yes, that's tough to see, and I respect his  decision just to pull out.  I am concerned that the left is putting  politics ahead of what's best for the country, and there's so many --  there's the V.A. position, Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, he's an  honorable man, a well-respected leader, he's proven himself, and yet too  many were willing to put politics ahead of what was best for the country.   We do need to get these people in place because that is part of making sure  that President Trump has the people around him to actually lead, and people  equal policy and he needs these people in place so that we can keep moving  forward.  There's a lot on our plate right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think people are figuring this out, that there's -- all of  these booby traps that are being put in by the skeptics and critics of  President Trump.  And then there's China, of course, reportedly threatening  to \"fierce counterstrike\" if the President goes ahead with these another  $100 billion in tariffs as punishment for the alleged intellectual property  theft.  Congressman, your thoughts on this.  I know Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary and a whole delegation are going next week to meet with  their counterparts in China to talk this out.</p><p> RODGERS:  Right.  Well, there's too many examples of illegal practices by  China, where we have seen them taking our intellectual property and  duplicating it.  I have examples in Eastern Washington, Washington State,  and it destroys companies here in America.  I am encouraged that President  Trump is focused on making sure that we hold China accountable.  I have had  concerns about the across-the-board approach to tariffs that, you know, he  was talking about imposing upon steel and aluminum.  I do believe it needs  to be more targeted but we must hold a country like China accountable for  illegal practices or free and fair trade will never work. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Bottom line, do you think that the President with his tough  talk and the team is going to be able to account that budget deficit with  China, which is already now up to 375 billion?</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, if anyone can do it, I believe it's President Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes,</p><p> RODGERS:  And he is focused on this.  I had the chance to spend some time  with Larry Kudlow just last week.  I'm really pleased to see him as the  head of the economic advisors, his chief economic adviser.  He understands  economics, world trade, and also what's going on in China.  And he  basically told us everything is on the table, tariffs, no tariffs,  sanctions, but we must hold them accountable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he's going to be on that trip as well, Larry Kudlow, and  Peter Navarro.  What about this budget about face, Congresswoman?   President Trump is now urging lawmakers to rescind some of the spending of  that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill which he signed last month.   Congresswoman, are there enough votes to make it happen and obviously you  must be getting just as much pushback as so many others are, for signing  that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill with all the spending?</p><p> RODGERS:  Right.  Well, we must address the spending in this country.  It  is the number one threat that faces us, both from a military perspective as  well as economic perspective, we needed to get a budget in place, but it  spends too much, and that's where I am -- I'm actually encouraged that the  President, Mick Mulvaney is leading on putting together a rescission  package.  </p><p> We should have been doing this all along, really taking a look at those  opportunities to go into programs, go into agencies and actually through  the House and the Senate, cut the spending.  The budget process is broken,  the House passed all 12 of our appropriations bills.  We went through  program by program, agency by agency, the Senate did zero.  So, this has  been very frustrating.  </p><p> This is our fundamental job as the elected representatives, this is where  we exercise the power of the purse, and yet this process is broken.  So, I  am -- I definitely want to look at what the President -- what they can  propose.  I think the House and Senate should also be using this tool of  rescissions to take action that we can to reduce those deficits and reduce  the debt.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his three-day  state visit with an address to the joint meeting of Congress.  How was it,  what was your takeaway?  He was critical of the President's planned  withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, I think, it is important that these conversations continue.   I've never been a supporter of the Iran deal.  I thought it was bad deal.   It did not hold Iran accountable for not developing or obtaining nuclear  weapons.  And that's where we need our European allies to join us in making  sure that we have a deal that is going to accomplish the goal of ensuring  that they do not develop nuclear weapons.  And right now, we do not have  that confidence. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, real quick, who are you supporting for Speaker of  the House?</p><p> RODGERS:  Well, you know, I -- we need to make sure that we are voting on a  Republican speaker after the elections, so we need to stay focused on the  policy and on our midterms and making sure that we're getting that done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Thanks so much.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ford Motor now pulling all but two of its  passenger cars from its North American line up as part of a plan to save  money and make the company more competitive.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  Stu, a car company canceling all of its  cars?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Well, you know, if you can't make money  selling cars, I guess you forget about selling cars, and you go to light  trucks and SUVs because that's where the money is.  It's a perfectly  rational move but boy, does it come as a shock.  You know, when I think of  the Ford Motor company, I think of the Taurus, one of the best-selling  marks for almost a generation.  It's gone.  They're not going to sell that  thing in North America any longer.  The Fiesta is going.  A couple of other  marks, I guess you'd call them, are going.  I was just shocked to hear  that.  It's a car company, but it's not a car company.  It's now a light  truck and SUV company because it wants to make some more money.  Look at  the stock, up 2-1/2 percent, just because its walking away from the car  market.  I wondered if General Motors will do something similar or FiatChrysler, walk away from unprofitable lines because you got to make money  in this environment and that's what you got to do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's really fascinating.</p><p> VARNEY:  I find it fascinating, I really do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is -- it is fascinating.  And remember the last CEO wanted  to make it a mobility company.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  My, how times change. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  I know you'll have a  lot more on it.  </p><p> VARNEY:  Sure, you will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart.  It is the busiest day of  the earnings season today, G.M. one of the big names out this morning.   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the  numbers.  Nic?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The busiest day  of 68 S&amp;P 500 companies, and to your point, your chat with Stuart, guess  what, G.M. is doing much of the same, focusing on a highly-profitable  pickup trucks, and that's what's costing them going forward for 2018.  So,  for the quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line.  Profit was on  the rise, and it's the high-margin vehicles that they're going to be  working on.  So, 2018, they expect that they will have flat profits but  expect the all new pickup trucks would boost the margins in 2019.  The  stock is down a half of one percent.  </p><p> Then, let's take a look at Starbucks.  So, we're expecting for Starbucks to  report after the bell today.  Global same-store sales are likely on the  rise to the tune of about 1.8 percent.  They still, obviously or have the  P.R. that they have to deal with from Philadelphia, removing those two  black men, but big spot is China.  That's where they see the growth.  In  fact, they're opening one new store in China every 15 hours.  And also, you  can get cold foam on your new -- on your new Starbucks.  All right, Dagen,  back to you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  So, coming up, it's not your average  day.  We are celebrating National Pretzel Day.  Maria's pretzel with a  small business is growing fast.  We take you live to plaza, where there is  a pretzel truck waiting.  I've already eaten one, they're delicious.  We'll  be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you outside on the plaza,  outside headquarters.  What a twist in this National Pretzel Day.  We are  celebrating in style with a small business that is growing fast.  Joining  me right now is Dan Dizio, he's the CEO and co-founder of Philly Pretzel  Factory and we've got the team here ready to munch on all pretzels.  Dan,  great to see you.  </p><p> DAN DIZIO, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY:  Me, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, and I love the MORNINGS WITH  MARIA in pretzel.  That is very cool, nice touch.  You've been selling  pretzels since you're 11 on the corner in Philadelphia.  Tell us how you  started your business.</p><p> DIZIO:  Yes, my next door neighbor had a pretzel bakery, got stuck with a  bunch of pretzels.  I'm 47 now.  This week, I'll be 47.  And he got stuck.   A woman asked if I would sell them on the shoe corner and we would split  the money.  And my mom said it would be OK.  He had to ask my mom  permission, and, for some reasons, my mom said it would be OK to stand on  the street corner all day (INAUDIBLE) but she said it was a different time  back then.  So -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DIZIO:  And, yes, I did it, and did real well, and the next thing I know  every guy was selling pretzels, and did all through middle school and high  school.  And I went to college and was a graduate, and had a stockbroker  job and just didn't like the 9:00 to 5:00 thing, and I want to get back to  the pretzel business and I talked my college roommate into doing a pretzel  business and that's how it started, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You started with the food truck, the Philly Pretzel Factory,  you've got the food truck -- Hi, everybody.  Did you have a pretzel?  Tell  me about the food truck business because this is a really successful way to  sell.</p><p> DIZIO:  Yes, we've had the truck for a few years now.  We're really doing  well with the weddings, bar mitzvahs, just different event.  I mean,  there's different places we could take it, so it'd be mobile.  That's the  way you have to be in this moment right now as for -- be able to  (INAUDIBLE) and be able to bring the pretzel to the people where they are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And now, you have 170 locations across the country.</p><p> DIZIO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're opening more stores.</p><p> DIZIO:  Yes, we're actually opening up 25 in New York right now.  We just  did area development deal to open up 25 in Manhattan over the next few  years.  So, we're excited about that.  And we have about 42 stores under  development.  So, we're really excited.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CASONE:  How long does it take to actually bake a pretzel?</p><p> DIZIO:  It takes about seven minutes to bake a pretzel.  Yes, yes.</p><p> CASONE:  OK.  Some of these.  OK.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CASONE:  And some sausage, am I right?</p><p> DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.</p><p> CASONE:  I'm digging it.</p><p> DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.  (INAUDIBLE) This is a new product we had.  It's  our mini hotdog trade.  We've done really well over the years with hotdog  pretzels.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a mini-hotdog stand.  I like that.</p><p> DIZIO:  And we do many hotdogs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fit for a party. </p><p> DIZIO:  That's exactly what it's meant for.  Tailgating parties.  It's been  a big hit.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the Republican tax plan, did that impact you as a small  business?</p><p> DIZIO:  It actually did.  I mean, more money for the small businesses.   Remember, our franchisees are business owners and there are small  businesses in communities, and to be able to have a tax break for them,  really lets them reinvest, maybe open another location up, reinvest.  I  mean, these are part of the community, these franchise locations.  I mean,  they sponsored the little league.  They have more money to do these things  and it really does have that effect to help everything in their  communities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p> DIZIO:  It's -- we're doing a lot in Midwest, a lot down south.  I mean,  Philadelphia has been haven for pretzels and it is where it all started.   So, we're stretching out, we're in 19 states now and it continues to grow  and people are fascinated and falling in love with the (INAUDIBLE) once we  had --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CASONE:  These are so good, Maria.  We have to get involved.  These are so  good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dan Dizio, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DIZIO:  Thank you.  It's great.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait, can I have the (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  These are just out of the oven.  Stuart Varney,  over to you.  Do you want to have pretzels?</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes.  Delivery, please.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll have it set up for you.</p><p> VARNEY:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Take it away, Stu.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  April 26.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m.  on the East Coast.   Earnings in focus on Wall Street.  Futures indicated to open stronger this  morning.  Stocks are expected to be up at the start of trading with Dow up  55, NASDAQ up 42.  Technology bigwigs, Amazon and Microsoft headlining the  biggest earning season of -- earnings day of the season rather.  This is  the single busiest earnings day of the quarter.  Both are due out after the  bell tonight.  We'll be watching those.  General Motors meanwhile beat  expectations last hour.  The stock is under pressure however over the  automaker's high restructuring expenses, stock down two percent.</p><p>Facebook meanwhile, shaking off the scandal.

Take a look at European  indices this morning after the ECB left interest rates unchanged last hour,  the Ft-100 now changed very much.  The CAC quarante is up about a half of a  percent and the DAX Index up a quarter of a percent.  We are waiting on the  ECB President Mario Draghi to start his news conference, that starts in  about 30 minutes and we'll tell you if there's anything else that he says  that might be market moving.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  Shanghai Composite was the worst performer down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump's pick to head the Department  of Veterans Affairs has pulled his name out of consideration.  The details  as Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination in a growing scrutiny from  lawmakers.  And the West Wing, Kanye not backing down from his support of  President Trump.  The Rapper's powerful message to his critics coming up.   A new robot that's more than meets the eye how scientists in Japan created  a real life transformer.  All of those coming up this morning and joining  me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall  Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman along with  Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth.  Great  to see you guys.  </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And great show so far.  We got a lot on the docket.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Sad story about Ronny Jackson.   This guy has really  served his country honorably and well and this is how Washington treats him  on the way out.  Just horrendous.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that is the news of the moment. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know if he's going to remain the doctor at the White  House but really, he didn't deserve this.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Well, it's a way for some people to try and  discourage from anybody serving in the Trump administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  A way to create chaos in President Trump's  administration.  That is the breaking news.  Dr. Ronny Jackson has  withdrawn as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Blake Burman is  live at the White House with all the details right now.  And Blake, the  news just broke about 10 minutes ago.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.  And Ronny Jackson has put out a  statement within the last few minutes here, Maria.  the bottom line with  this was the allegations just continue to pile and pile up against Dr.  Jackson who is the White House doctor had served under President George W.  Bush, President Obama, and now as the personal doctor as well to President  Trump who nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The  allegations were that he was drinking on the job, overprescribing medicine,  fostering a hostile work environment.  </p><p>Jackson had denied all of that but this morning says he does not want to go  forward with this process.  In a statement Jackson says the following,  \"going into the process, I expected tough questions about how to best care  for our veterans but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and  anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.  </p><p>He goes on to say, \"the allegations against me are completely false and  fabricating.  If they had any merit, I would not have been selected,  promoted, and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as  physician to three Presidents over the past 12 years.\"  The White House  throughout all of this over the last few days continues to stand by  Jackson, there was a Press Secretary Sarah Sanders joining the briefing  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Through Jackson's  record as a White House physician has been impeccable.  In fact because Dr.  Jackson has worked within arm's reach of three Presidents, he has received  more vetting than most nominees.  Given this unique position of trust and  responsibility, Dr. Jackson's background and character were evaluated  during three different administrations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  One thing that keep in mind here, Maria, is before all of these  allegations started rolling in and before the folks up on Capitol Hill put  a temporary pause on the nomination process.  There were serious questions  about whether or not Jackson was qualified to handle such a huge  bureaucracy.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, the President during that  news conference with Emmanuel Macron backed Jackson by saying look, this is  his decision to make, he is a qualified to lead this department and we will  find out from Jackson what he decides to do.  This morning, we have found  out he has pulled his name out from the nomination process and now the  White House has yet another open slot to fill, someone to lead the V.A.   Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that is exactly what the left and the resist movement wants  as much chaos as possible around the Trump administration.  Joining us  right now is Gianno Caldwell, we just saw in the moment.  Gianno, thanks  very much for being here this morning.  Fox News Political Analyst,  Republican strategists, Caldwell strategic consulting founder.  Your  reaction to this.  I mean, obviously, this is more -- booby traps in the  Trump administration.  Who leaked all of this or created this around Dr.  Ronny Jackson forcing him to withdraw in your view? </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  We've seen leaks throughout  this entire start of this administration.  And I think it's very  unfortunate.  Further, I think Sarah Sanders said something that was  particularly interesting and I -- and I thought to be very true that Dr.  Ronny Jackson is an individual who's been vetted by three administrations.   So if these were to be true why wasn't that found to be the case in these  other vetting processes?  So it's something that I think that's obviously  harmful to the Trump administration because we've seen nominees put their  name in and have to withdraw.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  So that particularly problematic.  And I'm sad to see him go but  I know that there are some other good people that can step in his place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  I think an excellent candidate with V.P. to be the new V.A.  secretary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, exact -- well, we talked about that earlier, you're  absolutely right.  But I mean, is -- are the people going to -- going to  come forward and make noise about this?  How is this going to stop with all  of these, you know, booby traps and barriers that the resist movement is  putting in place for the Trump administration? </p><p>HEGSETH:  I think your only option in situation like this is to fight back  and fight back ferociously because it isn't just the leaks, it isn't just  the Obama administration.  Do watch other networks --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The media.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They go wall-to-wall on person speculation, anonymously source  with no verification to smear this guy.  I was forced to watch one of these  other networks yesterday for whatever reason and they didn't stop, it was  all Ronny Jackson, all based on nothing.  Gianno, how do you overcome that  in this environment?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know what, I think that's why it's been President Trump's  best quality.  You saw that through the 2015 election where they would  smear him, they would come at him hard and he wouldn't back down.  And I  think that that President Trump is going to people who love and that's the  reason why he actually won the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And we have to see more of that just that we're going to push  back, we're going to push book no matter what you say and how you try to  smear people because these are legitimately good people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all shaming, it's public shaming.  I'll tell you who  is pushing back, Kanye West.  He's calling it the mob.  Let's talk about  his Make America Great moment.  The rapper face backlash for praising  President Trump yesterday posting on Twitter.  Here's what he said, Kanye  West.  You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob cannot make me not  love him.  We are both dragging energy, he is my brother, I love everyone,  I don't agree with everything anyone does.  That's what makes us  individuals and we have the right to independent thought.  Amen to Kanye  West.  Good for him.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Amen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He goes on to -- and then the President actually responded, and  the President tweeted out, thank you, Kanye.  Very cool.  Gianno, your  reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know, it's interesting.  I'm in my hometown at Chicago right  now and of course this is where Kanye is from.  And I'll be talking about  this on largest urban radio station after this interview but this is I  think excellent.  And I'll tell you why I think it's excellent.  Kanye West  has been an individual who's not willing to back down, he's unrelenting in  what he believes.  And I think that the degree, he really appreciates that  in President Trump more than anything.  </p><p>We saw in the 2016 election as I mentioned before, President Trump did not  back down, whatsoever and I wrote a piece about him in the Hill why the  Republican base (INAUDIBLE) it won't break and he read it and sent me a  note.  And in that piece, I said that the Republicans chose him as the guy  that they wanted to win elections because after the media began to attack  him and he was losing business deals, he lost millions saying what he  believes.  </p><p>He didn't step back like most businessmen would, he didn't step back like  most politicians would, he doubled down on it.  And with that being the  case, then says that I'm unapologetic in my view, I'm unapologetic in  American First policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And I'm unapologetic keeping our country safe.  And I think most  people can appreciate that, most people can evaluate that and most people  voted for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gianno though, it's Dagen.  Never forget, Kanye is always about  Kanye.  Kanye is not about -- he is not -- he is not standing up for any  issue quite frankly, he is doing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a shame.  He's pushing back on shaming, calling them  the mob.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I argue that he is doing it for the attention because he knows  that basically siding with President Trump will get him the most attention.   Going after President Obama will get him the most attention.  He isn't  married to the Kardashian clan after all.  Maybe they're learning from him  rather than the other way around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But this also started after the USA communications  director Candace Owens, she hit back at the Democratic Party and she  defend-- she was Fox last night with Martha.  Listen to how she defended  Kanye and what she said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CANDACE OWENS, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Once they inflate our body's  Democratic Party, let's say they haven't slayed our minds, they have told  true who we must love, who we must hate, what we must think, what ideas are  unacceptable.  In the long run, it just -- it just doesn't add up.  Listen,  I think differently, Kanye West thinks differently.  I can guarantee you if  he and I get in the same room, we will have a lot of disagreements.  The  one thing that we will celebrate is our right to think differently.  I  don't understand what's so controversial for the left to understand this.   The way that they had demonized him in the last 72 hours, it's almost  sickening but at the end of the day it's going to have adverse effects.  I  can guarantee you that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well said, Candace.  Gianno, what do you make of all of this?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  I agree with what Candace has said and I'm going to have to push  back on Dagen just a -- just a bit respectfully.  Kanye is about himself,  that's unquestionable.  I know we all realize that.  However, this is an  individual who definitely has gone against ever since I have known him  before he became a national figure.  The marginalization of thought.   Specifically marginalization of who we are as individuals so often as the  society were programmed.  </p><p>I believe to do what's reasonable and what were pretty much taught in  school and I think he goes beyond that and says look, let's look deep  inside ourselves and fulfill our greatest potential.  And generally  speaking when you do that, when you legitimately do that, it's going to  make people uncomfortable and say, hey what you're doing is unreasonable  and maybe you should rethink your decision but generally speaking the  greatest folks we've seen, Mark Zuckerberg, Kanye West, Donald Trump, the  individuals that really succeeded become these megastars are the ones that  go beyond what's public as a final thought.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.  James Freeman here at the Journal.  I'm not sure why  we're talking about Kanye allegedly being all about himself.  I mean, I  don't know -- I don't know what's in his head but the idea that someone  puts out a message that compliments the President, encourages people to  think freely, and says he loves everyone.  Or why are you saying -- well,  he's about himself?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can ask me that question because I'm the one who said it --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- James because he does -- he does and says things to garner  the most attention.  And so being complimentary in this environment,  President Obama is not going to garner him the most attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he has courage by saying it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to --</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's triggering a very important conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- he -- Kanye West has never lacked courage.  I'm not  arguing that.  I'm just saying that there's always a motive and it is about  -- Kanye is not right or left, not Democrat or Republican, Kanye is Kanye  at the end of the day.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  He has an album that's coming out and he loves --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. The album is coming out.</p><p>CALDWELL:  -- due to his compliments in the President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this -- they shame you if you say anything positive about  the President.  You know, you get shamed online if you say anything  positive about the President.  I like to see somebody, who pushes back  because it's wrong.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And he's is breaking the mode on that, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's breaking --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  Because we've got -- we've gone to an extreme point in time  where you can't say anything complimentary about President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Former FBI Director Jim Comey who's been  trashing the President in every interview and he leaked memos, a catalyst  for the special counsel investigation.  That memo was more wildly shared  than we thought initially.  Sources telling Fox News Comey likely gave the  documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another  person along with the with Columbia Law School professor and watch Comey  struggle to defend his actions last night at a CNN town hall.  Listen to  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  You did leak memos, I mean, is it OK for  somebody at the FBI to leak something, an internal document even if it's  not classified?  Isn't that leaking? </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  It was a whole lot wrong with your  question, Anderson.  First, I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to  communicate the substance of one unclassified </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that  it'd be out in media, I wanted it to get in the media.  As a private  citizen, I could do that and did that just as I have written about it in my  book.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does he think just saying this is going to make people think  otherwise?  We're -- we saw what happened.  Gianno, your reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  That is my definition leaking.  He gave information and now,  this is developing at the harvest of the FBI and he gave it to a friend, to  spring this special counsel and if I -- if I recall correctly, I think it  was reported at The Washington -- Wall Street Journal who said after  reading the Comey memos, there is -- they see no reason why there should  have been a special counsel to begin with.  So with that being the case,  Jim Comey definitely is in a position where he's losing all credibility if  he had any left.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget that zero intelligence that was used  to launch the investigation which Devin Nunes told us about.  Gianno, thank  you.  Good to see you.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Good seeing you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive dragnet in Maine after a man shot and  killed a sheriff's deputy.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, John Williams.  They say that the 29-year-old gunned down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine.  That is just  North of Augusta.  Williams drove the cruiser to a nearby convenience store  and he robbed it.  Police releasing this photo, this captured of him from  inside of the stolen car.  He then abandoned that car nearby, he has not  been seen since.  Deputy Cole had been on the force 13 years. He leaves  behind a son.  The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot at  a Dallas Home Depot, one of them was killed there.  Officer Rogelio  Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him  in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest.  22 officers have  been shot and killed so far this year.  That is more than double from the  same time last year and on average, you're not going to believe this, at  least one officer has reportedly been shot to death every week in 2018.  </p><p>Well, earning season is in high gear this morning.  We're just getting  results from a couple of big airlines, you know, and let's start with  American, the stock is trading lower almost 4-1/2 percent to the downside  in the premarket.  Their first quarter revenue just missed the street  estimate.  Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents actually topped  expectations, not helping out though.  Let's take a look at Southwest, they  also are under pressure ahead of the opening bell down more than 3-1/2  percent.  Revenue coming up short of estimates.  Southwest did add -- the  bookings are down after an engine on its one planes exploded last week  killing a passenger and that was Southwest's first fatality in the  carrier's history.  </p><p>And then finally there's this.  You want to be careful, the next car that  you hop in to might be Megatron.  Japanese engineers created a real life  Transformer that can actually carry people onboard.  This is the first  scene we've ever seen anything like this.  It's a robot car.  It walks over  18 miles an hour and transforms into a sports car with people still inside.   The robot creator says he was yes inspired by his childhood Transformer  heroes that he watched in the movies in growing up.  There you have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, very cool.</p><p>CASONE:  Very cool.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  The outlook on trade with China, big delegation  going next week.  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers will weigh in on the  new report that Chinese companies are already reconsidering investments in  the American market as Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary gets set to  visit his counterpart in China next week.  Then founding partner of  AlphaOne Capital Partners Dan Niles joins me to talk about Facebook's  quarterly results, he predicted the company would beat.  I'll get his take  on the company's surging revenue and where it goes next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Focus on Facebook.  The social media company  beat earnings and revenue expectations last night despite the fallout from  the privacy scandal.  Yesterday, Facebook reported adjusted earnings per  share of $1.69 on revenue of $11.97 billion.  That was the first quarter of  2018.  Shares of Facebook right now are up seven percent in the premarket.   Joining us right now on the telephone is the founding partner of AlphaOne  Capital Partners, Dan Niles.  One of his big positions is Facebook.  And  Dan, good to have you.  Thanks very much for weighing in here.  You  predicted that the company would beat revenue and earnings expectations.   What's your take away from the numbers?</p><p>DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDING PARTNER (via telephone):  I  mean, quite honestly, it's even better than what I was expecting.  You have  to look at the revenues first and revenues year-over-year in the June  quarter were up 45 percent.  And the September and December quarters,  accelerated up 47 percent.  And what's interesting is even with all the  negative publicity around the supposed data scandal, the revenues  accelerates 50 percent year over year in (INAUDIBLE) they keep the  operating income by about 14 percent where their margins were better than  expected and they keep the ETF by over 20 percent.  I mean, back out some  of the one time.  So it's really hard to find a whole lot negative in the  report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about expenses going forward in this whole regulatory  scrutiny?  I mean, are we going to see, you know, new rules regulations  that this company is going to have to adhere to in the entire industry,  we'll have to adhere to that will change the reason to own the stock  because expenses are higher?</p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I really don't think so.  I mean, here is a way to think  about it.  Even though expenses they guided to up 50 to 60 percent,  originally they guided up 45 to 60.  Estimates are actually going up after  this print because they beat the operating income margins by so much that  even though their guiding expenses higher most of the street is actually  raising EPS.  </p><p>The second thing is, I'm sure there will be some extra regulations they  need to adhere to, obviously they talk on the call about the general  protection regulations coming out on May 25th in Europe but the interesting  thing as they said, even with those regulations, they don't anticipate  those changes really significantly impacting our revenue, they do think  daily active users could be cracked down in the second quarter but, you  know, that's really not affecting the revenues.  </p><p>And quite honestly the extra regulations with them, it will -- it will help  make their site a lot safer and to some extent it's going to impact their  smaller competitors a lot more.  They don't have same resources as Facebook  to comply with that. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Hi, Dan.  James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal.  I'd like to  talk about those potential smaller competitors.  Normally those kind of fat  profit margins attract competition.  Who is it that can challenge Facebook,  either among startups or existing tech giants moving into their business. </p><p>NILES:  Well, I mean, you obviously know the list of characters, you've got  Twitter, you've got Snapchat obviously, two public companies talked about  most often.  But I mean, they've been competing since the beginning and  you've obviously seen this market is, you know, not necessarily winner take  post but it's sort evolving that way as Facebook continues to execute and  they're executing really across all of the metrics.  So it's not just  growing revenue but they're highly, highly profitable.  </p><p>They have 46 percent operating marks. And so -- and you have to remember,  to some extent they are a startup in different businesses, so we talked  about Facebook, they've got 2.2 billion users and Instagram 800 million  users, so that's great.  What we don't talk about that much is the 1.3  billion users for Facebook messenger is that they just started to make  money off of and they make absolutely no money off of the 1.5 billion  WhatsApp users.  </p><p>So they've got -- to some extent two startups buried within the company  between Messenger and WhatsApp that they still haven't really started to  monetize yet and that gives me a lot of comfort especially when you look at  the multiples of trading at 20 times non-gap, you know, under 18 earnings.   Markets up 17.  These are growing the top line at 50 percent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The world is wash in venture capital.  Are new competitors being  funded?  And if not, why not?  Is Facebook seen as so dominate that that  won't work? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, I think people are trying to work around the edges  but you have to remember with Facebook, there is something pretty unique  which is the network effect.  You're not going to get off of Facebook and  go to Google plus if your friends aren't there.  So, you can't really  easily switch.  If you're dealing with Google for example and somebody came  out with a much better search engine, you know, there's nothing to stop you  from going to the other one, the problem with this is that even if somebody  didn't develop a great other alternative social media site, you're not  going to move unless all of your friends move too.  And that's probably not  going to happen immediately.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan, real quick.  Intel and Microsoft after the bell tonight,  good quarters?  What are you expecting? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, Intel is one of our largest positions.  We like it  quite a bit.  I think the real key for Intel is enterprise demand has been  really bad for the last couple years.  That really started to improve in  the fourth quarter and I think it's going to be very good for this year.   So we like Intel a lot and it's got a low multiple as well in this  environment at about 14 times.  So we like that quite a bit and Microsoft,  similarly we think they should have a pretty solid quarter.  A multiple is  quite a bit higher at 24 times, so not as preferred to us as Intel. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Dan, always great to talk  with you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>NILES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Dan Niles joining us there.  AlphaOne  Capital.  Coming up.  House Republican Conference chair and Washington  Congressman Cathy McMorris Rogders joins me next. We'll get her take on  French President Macron's state visit with President Trump, trade, and a  lot more.  Then a new twist on coffee just in time for summer.  Starbucks  introducing cold foam before reporting earnings after the bell tonight.  We  break down the expectations.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first-quarter earnings, General Motors and Pepsico among  the companies reporting their first-quarter this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations, while PepsiCo was mixed.  Both stocks are under some selling  pressure this morning by a fraction.  Investors are waiting on big tech.   Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all reporting, after the close tonight, all the  stocks are trading up about two percent right now.  </p><p>Broader markets this morning are higher.  March durable goods just came out  up 2.6 percent versus an estimate of 1.6 percent that was better than  expected.  The news is a positive for markets, and we are seeing a pretty  good tone today.  The Dow Industrials set to open about 50 points, that's a  quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up a third of a percent right now.  And the NASDAQ up 50 points,  that's three-quarters of one percent.  The Dow yesterday snapped a five-day  losing streak.  And the momentum continues today.  That was lifted by  Boeing's big earnings beat.  Boeing's stock did well as did the Dow up 60  points at the close, a quarter of a percent higher.  The S&amp;P was also  fractionally better on the day.  The NASDAQ yesterday, closed lower by  three points.  </p><p>In Europe, this morning, the major indices are higher.  The European  Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, and Mario Draghi is about to  speak in his press conference.  FT-100 up 7-1/2, CAC Quarante up 35, that's  two-thirds of a percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a  percent, 43 points higher.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>President Trump lashing out against Jim Comey.  He's targeting the former  FBI Director on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago.  We will tell you what the  President just told our colleagues there.  And breaking news this morning,  Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination as Secretary of Veterans  Affairs.  President Trump weighed in on the announcement earlier this hour  on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" he placed the blame squarely on Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I even told them a day or  two ago.  I saw this was -- where this was going.  And you know they're  very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again first in his class at West  Point, top in class at Harvard Law School, a brilliant guy, a great guy,  and somebody I get along with very well.  You know, Mike got through and  they thought they had him stopped.  The Democrats are obstructionists.   It's horrible what they're doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Capitol Hill coming up this morning.  And then  just in time for summer, Starbucks added -- adds cold foam.  The details  ahead of the company's earnings report later this hour.  The stock is up,  half of a percent.  Plus, it is National Pretzel Day.  We are celebrating  pretzel day here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Wait until you see this pretzel  that they made of my face.  I don't -- I don't think it looks like me but  let me see if I can grab this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is Pretzel Day.  There you go.  OK, we'll get to that coming  up this morning, but first, our top story right now, President Trump  lashing out at Jim Comey, this morning.  Here's what he had to say about  the fired FBI Director in a new interview this morning with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\"  moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Comey is a leaker and he's a liar.  And not only on this stuff,  he's been leaking for years.  He's probably been using his friend, the so- called professor, who now turns out to have FBI clearance which he never  said.  He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress, he  said he gave it to a friend.  And he gave it to a friend to leak classified  information.  It is all classified, it was totally classified.  So, he  illegally -- he did an illegal act, and he said it himself, in order to get  a special counsel against me. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is House Republican Conference Chair and  Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Good to see you,  Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p>REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R), WASHINGTON, CHAIR, HOUSE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this.  You know, I was actually really struck  by the interview last night that Comey did with CNN, and basically he said,  no, I didn't leak anything but then went on to talk about how, in fact, he  did leak these memos that he wrote which as soon as an FBI Director writes  a memo in FBI, you know, headquarters, that is the property of the FBI, but  he said he passed it on to his friend and told his friend, oh, just get  this to the New York Times but don't actually give them the paper, and he  said that's not leaking.  Your reaction.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, it's -- yes, it begs a lot of questions.  And in someone  who believes it's so important that we are restoring trust, that we're  restoring the rule of law in this country, the FBI is the highest law  enforcement agency.  This is -- the people within the FBI must be held to  the highest standards, and that is what causes me so much dismay right now  is just the cloud that is over the FBI, and the questions that it has  raised.  We need the men and women there to act in the utmost authority, as  well as transparency and accountability to the American people.  And so,  yes, he clearly leaked, and it raises a lot of questions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is there going to be any accountability here,  Congresswoman?  I mean, look, last weekend, I had your colleague,  Congressman Devin Nunes on my Sunday morning program and he said, after  looking at all the electronic communications, he realized that there was no  intelligence used to actually launch an investigation into the Trump  campaign.  So, what happens now?  I mean, can we just keep seeing, you  know, people at the top of these important agencies abuse their power with  no accountability?</p><p>RODGERS:  No one is above the law and they must be held accountable.  And  that's the role of Congress, that's the role of the elected representatives  of the people within the House to make sure that we are taking action to  hold them accountable.  So, both in the Intelligence Committee as well as  the government oversight and reform committee which Trey Gowdy is the  chairman of, that's where these questions are asked and that's where  there's been frustration, that documents have not been turned over, that  people have not been as forthright in answering the questions, but it is up  to us to make sure that people are held accountable and that no one is  above the law. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, we'll be watching what develops then.  Then  there is this, the breaking news this breaking news this morning,  Congresswoman, and that is Dr. Ronny Jackson withdrawing his name for  consideration for the head of the V.A., President Trump's pick to lead the  Department of Veterans Affairs pulled his nomination in the last hour amid  all of these questions surrounding his professional conduct.   Congresswoman, your reaction to this news?</p><p>RODGERS:  I respect his decision.  It's most important that we get someone  at the V.A.  Again, we need to restore trust between the veterans and this  agency whose mission is to serve our veterans.  And as someone who  represents nearly 70,000 veterans in eastern Washington, I hear regularly  from veterans who feel like when they contact the V.A. that they're more of  a burden than actually having the red carpet rolled out for them.  So, we  need someone to head up the V.A., we need to get focused on the mission of  the V.A., and make sure that our veterans, those who have served are  getting the care that they need when the time comes, that has to be a top  priority for us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean, can we just ignore all of the barriers and the  booby traps that the left is putting in place for the Trump administration?   I mean, look at all of the positions that are yet unfilled.  Look at all of  the slow walking going on in terms of getting his nominees passed.  You  know, Mike Pompeo got -- you know, got support, but it was close.  I mean,  what about that, who is doing this?  We know that three administrations  have said how great Dr. Ronny Jackson is and all of a sudden, somebody  leaks all of this speculation about his personal life.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, that is -- yes, that's tough to see, and I respect his  decision just to pull out.  I am concerned that the left is putting  politics ahead of what's best for the country, and there's so many --  there's the V.A. position, Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, he's an  honorable man, a well-respected leader, he's proven himself, and yet too  many were willing to put politics ahead of what was best for the country.   We do need to get these people in place because that is part of making sure  that President Trump has the people around him to actually lead, and people  equal policy and he needs these people in place so that we can keep moving  forward.  There's a lot on our plate right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think people are figuring this out, that there's -- all of  these booby traps that are being put in by the skeptics and critics of  President Trump.  And then there's China, of course, reportedly threatening  to \"fierce counterstrike\" if the President goes ahead with these another  $100 billion in tariffs as punishment for the alleged intellectual property  theft.  Congressman, your thoughts on this.  I know Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary and a whole delegation are going next week to meet with  their counterparts in China to talk this out.</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, there's too many examples of illegal practices by  China, where we have seen them taking our intellectual property and  duplicating it.  I have examples in Eastern Washington, Washington State,  and it destroys companies here in America.  I am encouraged that President  Trump is focused on making sure that we hold China accountable.  I have had  concerns about the across-the-board approach to tariffs that, you know, he  was talking about imposing upon steel and aluminum.  I do believe it needs  to be more targeted but we must hold a country like China accountable for  illegal practices or free and fair trade will never work. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bottom line, do you think that the President with his tough  talk and the team is going to be able to account that budget deficit with  China, which is already now up to 375 billion?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, if anyone can do it, I believe it's President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes,</p><p>RODGERS:  And he is focused on this.  I had the chance to spend some time  with Larry Kudlow just last week.  I'm really pleased to see him as the  head of the economic advisors, his chief economic adviser.  He understands  economics, world trade, and also what's going on in China.  And he  basically told us everything is on the table, tariffs, no tariffs,  sanctions, but we must hold them accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's going to be on that trip as well, Larry Kudlow, and  Peter Navarro.  What about this budget about face, Congresswoman?   President Trump is now urging lawmakers to rescind some of the spending of  that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill which he signed last month.   Congresswoman, are there enough votes to make it happen and obviously you  must be getting just as much pushback as so many others are, for signing  that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill with all the spending?</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, we must address the spending in this country.  It  is the number one threat that faces us, both from a military perspective as  well as economic perspective, we needed to get a budget in place, but it  spends too much, and that's where I am -- I'm actually encouraged that the  President, Mick Mulvaney is leading on putting together a rescission  package.  </p><p>We should have been doing this all along, really taking a look at those  opportunities to go into programs, go into agencies and actually through  the House and the Senate, cut the spending.  The budget process is broken,  the House passed all 12 of our appropriations bills.  We went through  program by program, agency by agency, the Senate did zero.  So, this has  been very frustrating.  </p><p>This is our fundamental job as the elected representatives, this is where  we exercise the power of the purse, and yet this process is broken.  So, I  am -- I definitely want to look at what the President -- what they can  propose.  I think the House and Senate should also be using this tool of  rescissions to take action that we can to reduce those deficits and reduce  the debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his three-day  state visit with an address to the joint meeting of Congress.  How was it,  what was your takeaway?  He was critical of the President's planned  withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, I think, it is important that these conversations continue.   I've never been a supporter of the Iran deal.  I thought it was bad deal.   It did not hold Iran accountable for not developing or obtaining nuclear  weapons.  And that's where we need our European allies to join us in making  sure that we have a deal that is going to accomplish the goal of ensuring  that they do not develop nuclear weapons.  And right now, we do not have  that confidence. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, real quick, who are you supporting for Speaker of  the House?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, you know, I -- we need to make sure that we are voting on a  Republican speaker after the elections, so we need to stay focused on the  policy and on our midterms and making sure that we're getting that done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Thanks so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ford Motor now pulling all but two of its  passenger cars from its North American line up as part of a plan to save  money and make the company more competitive.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  Stu, a car company canceling all of its  cars?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Well, you know, if you can't make money  selling cars, I guess you forget about selling cars, and you go to light  trucks and SUVs because that's where the money is.  It's a perfectly  rational move but boy, does it come as a shock.  You know, when I think of  the Ford Motor company, I think of the Taurus, one of the best-selling  marks for almost a generation.  It's gone.  They're not going to sell that  thing in North America any longer.  The Fiesta is going.  A couple of other  marks, I guess you'd call them, are going.  I was just shocked to hear  that.  It's a car company, but it's not a car company.  It's now a light  truck and SUV company because it wants to make some more money.  Look at  the stock, up 2-1/2 percent, just because its walking away from the car  market.  I wondered if General Motors will do something similar or FiatChrysler, walk away from unprofitable lines because you got to make money  in this environment and that's what you got to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really fascinating.</p><p>VARNEY:  I find it fascinating, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is -- it is fascinating.  And remember the last CEO wanted  to make it a mobility company.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  My, how times change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  I know you'll have a  lot more on it.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Sure, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart.  It is the busiest day of  the earnings season today, G.M. one of the big names out this morning.   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the  numbers.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The busiest day  of 68 S&amp;P 500 companies, and to your point, your chat with Stuart, guess  what, G.M. is doing much of the same, focusing on a highly-profitable  pickup trucks, and that's what's costing them going forward for 2018.  So,  for the quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line.  Profit was on  the rise, and it's the high-margin vehicles that they're going to be  working on.  So, 2018, they expect that they will have flat profits but  expect the all new pickup trucks would boost the margins in 2019.  The  stock is down a half of one percent.  </p><p>Then, let's take a look at Starbucks.  So, we're expecting for Starbucks to  report after the bell today.  Global same-store sales are likely on the  rise to the tune of about 1.8 percent.  They still, obviously or have the  P.R. that they have to deal with from Philadelphia, removing those two  black men, but big spot is China.  That's where they see the growth.  In  fact, they're opening one new store in China every 15 hours.  And also, you  can get cold foam on your new -- on your new Starbucks.  All right, Dagen,  back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  So, coming up, it's not your average  day.  We are celebrating National Pretzel Day.  Maria's pretzel with a  small business is growing fast.  We take you live to plaza, where there is  a pretzel truck waiting.  I've already eaten one, they're delicious.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you outside on the plaza,  outside headquarters.  What a twist in this National Pretzel Day.  We are  celebrating in style with a small business that is growing fast.  Joining  me right now is Dan Dizio, he's the CEO and co-founder of Philly Pretzel  Factory and we've got the team here ready to munch on all pretzels.  Dan,  great to see you.  </p><p>DAN DIZIO, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY:  Me, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, and I love the MORNINGS WITH  MARIA in pretzel.  That is very cool, nice touch.  You've been selling  pretzels since you're 11 on the corner in Philadelphia.  Tell us how you  started your business.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, my next door neighbor had a pretzel bakery, got stuck with a  bunch of pretzels.  I'm 47 now.  This week, I'll be 47.  And he got stuck.   A woman asked if I would sell them on the shoe corner and we would split  the money.  And my mom said it would be OK.  He had to ask my mom  permission, and, for some reasons, my mom said it would be OK to stand on  the street corner all day (INAUDIBLE) but she said it was a different time  back then.  So -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  And, yes, I did it, and did real well, and the next thing I know  every guy was selling pretzels, and did all through middle school and high  school.  And I went to college and was a graduate, and had a stockbroker  job and just didn't like the 9:00 to 5:00 thing, and I want to get back to  the pretzel business and I talked my college roommate into doing a pretzel  business and that's how it started, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You started with the food truck, the Philly Pretzel Factory,  you've got the food truck -- Hi, everybody.  Did you have a pretzel?  Tell  me about the food truck business because this is a really successful way to  sell.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we've had the truck for a few years now.  We're really doing  well with the weddings, bar mitzvahs, just different event.  I mean,  there's different places we could take it, so it'd be mobile.  That's the  way you have to be in this moment right now as for -- be able to  (INAUDIBLE) and be able to bring the pretzel to the people where they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, you have 170 locations across the country.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're opening more stores.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we're actually opening up 25 in New York right now.  We just  did area development deal to open up 25 in Manhattan over the next few  years.  So, we're excited about that.  And we have about 42 stores under  development.  So, we're really excited.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  How long does it take to actually bake a pretzel?</p><p>DIZIO:  It takes about seven minutes to bake a pretzel.  Yes, yes.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  Some of these.  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  And some sausage, am I right?</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm digging it.</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.  (INAUDIBLE) This is a new product we had.  It's  our mini hotdog trade.  We've done really well over the years with hotdog  pretzels.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a mini-hotdog stand.  I like that.</p><p>DIZIO:  And we do many hotdogs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fit for a party. </p><p>DIZIO:  That's exactly what it's meant for.  Tailgating parties.  It's been  a big hit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the Republican tax plan, did that impact you as a small  business?</p><p>DIZIO:  It actually did.  I mean, more money for the small businesses.   Remember, our franchisees are business owners and there are small  businesses in communities, and to be able to have a tax break for them,  really lets them reinvest, maybe open another location up, reinvest.  I  mean, these are part of the community, these franchise locations.  I mean,  they sponsored the little league.  They have more money to do these things  and it really does have that effect to help everything in their  communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p>DIZIO:  It's -- we're doing a lot in Midwest, a lot down south.  I mean,  Philadelphia has been haven for pretzels and it is where it all started.   So, we're stretching out, we're in 19 states now and it continues to grow  and people are fascinated and falling in love with the (INAUDIBLE) once we  had --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  These are so good, Maria.  We have to get involved.  These are so  good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan Dizio, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  Thank you.  It's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait, can I have the (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  These are just out of the oven.  Stuart Varney,  over to you.  Do you want to have pretzels?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Delivery, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll have it set up for you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take it away, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, April 26. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Earnings in focus on Wall Street. Futures indicated to open stronger this morning. Stocks are expected to be up at the start of trading with Dow up 55, NASDAQ up 42. Technology bigwigs, Amazon and Microsoft headlining the biggest earning season of -- earnings day of the season rather. This is the single busiest earnings day of the quarter. Both are due out after the bell tonight. We'll be watching those. General Motors meanwhile beat expectations last hour. The stock is under pressure however over the automaker's high restructuring expenses, stock down two percent.</p><p>Facebook meanwhile, shaking off the scandal. Shares soaring in the premarket up almost seven percent after the company beat expectations yesterday and posted strong growth in daily users. Take a look at European indices this morning after the ECB left interest rates unchanged last hour, the Ft-100 now changed very much. The CAC quarante is up about a half of a percent and the DAX Index up a quarter of a percent. We are waiting on the ECB President Mario Draghi to start his news conference, that starts in about 30 minutes and we'll tell you if there's anything else that he says that might be market moving. In Asia overnight, markets were mixed. The Shanghai Composite was the worst performer down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump's pick to head the Department of Veterans Affairs has pulled his name out of consideration. The details as Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination in a growing scrutiny from lawmakers. And the West Wing, Kanye not backing down from his support of President Trump. The Rapper's powerful message to his critics coming up. A new robot that's more than meets the eye how scientists in Japan created a real life transformer. All of those coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman along with Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth. Great to see you guys.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And great show so far. We got a lot on the docket.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Sad story about Ronny Jackson. This guy has really served his country honorably and well and this is how Washington treats him on the way out. Just horrendous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And that is the news of the moment.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't know if he's going to remain the doctor at the White House but really, he didn't deserve this.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Well, it's a way for some people to try and discourage from anybody serving in the Trump administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. A way to create chaos in President Trump's administration. That is the breaking news. Dr. Ronny Jackson has withdrawn as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs. Blake Burman is live at the White House with all the details right now. And Blake, the news just broke about 10 minutes ago.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And Ronny Jackson has put out a statement within the last few minutes here, Maria. the bottom line with this was the allegations just continue to pile and pile up against Dr. Jackson who is the White House doctor had served under President George W. Bush, President Obama, and now as the personal doctor as well to President Trump who nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. The allegations were that he was drinking on the job, overprescribing medicine, fostering a hostile work environment.</p><p>Jackson had denied all of that but this morning says he does not want to go forward with this process. In a statement Jackson says the following, \"going into the process, I expected tough questions about how to best care for our veterans but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.</p><p>He goes on to say, \"the allegations against me are completely false and fabricating. If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted, and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three Presidents over the past 12 years.\" The White House throughout all of this over the last few days continues to stand by Jackson, there was a Press Secretary Sarah Sanders joining the briefing yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Through Jackson's record as a White House physician has been impeccable. In fact because Dr. Jackson has worked within arm's reach of three Presidents, he has received more vetting than most nominees. Given this unique position of trust and responsibility, Dr. Jackson's background and character were evaluated during three different administrations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: One thing that keep in mind here, Maria, is before all of these allegations started rolling in and before the folks up on Capitol Hill put a temporary pause on the nomination process. There were serious questions about whether or not Jackson was qualified to handle such a huge bureaucracy. The Department of Veterans Affairs, the President during that news conference with Emmanuel Macron backed Jackson by saying look, this is his decision to make, he is a qualified to lead this department and we will find out from Jackson what he decides to do. This morning, we have found out he has pulled his name out from the nomination process and now the White House has yet another open slot to fill, someone to lead the V.A. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that is exactly what the left and the resist movement wants as much chaos as possible around the Trump administration. Joining us right now is Gianno Caldwell, we just saw in the moment. Gianno, thanks very much for being here this morning. Fox News Political Analyst, Republican strategists, Caldwell strategic consulting founder. Your reaction to this. I mean, obviously, this is more -- booby traps in the Trump administration. Who leaked all of this or created this around Dr. Ronny Jackson forcing him to withdraw in your view?</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: We've seen leaks throughout this entire start of this administration. And I think it's very unfortunate. Further, I think Sarah Sanders said something that was particularly interesting and I -- and I thought to be very true that Dr. Ronny Jackson is an individual who's been vetted by three administrations. So if these were to be true why wasn't that found to be the case in these other vetting processes? So it's something that I think that's obviously harmful to the Trump administration because we've seen nominees put their name in and have to withdraw.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CALDWELL: So that particularly problematic. And I'm sad to see him go but I know that there are some other good people that can step in his place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CALDWELL: I think an excellent candidate with V.P. to be the new V.A. secretary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, exact -- well, we talked about that earlier, you're absolutely right. But I mean, is -- are the people going to -- going to come forward and make noise about this? How is this going to stop with all of these, you know, booby traps and barriers that the resist movement is putting in place for the Trump administration?</p><p>HEGSETH: I think your only option in situation like this is to fight back and fight back ferociously because it isn't just the leaks, it isn't just the Obama administration. Do watch other networks --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The media.</p><p>HEGSETH: They go wall-to-wall on person speculation, anonymously source with no verification to smear this guy. I was forced to watch one of these other networks yesterday for whatever reason and they didn't stop, it was all Ronny Jackson, all based on nothing. Gianno, how do you overcome that in this environment?</p><p>CALDWELL: You know what, I think that's why it's been President Trump's best quality. You saw that through the 2015 election where they would smear him, they would come at him hard and he wouldn't back down. And I think that that President Trump is going to people who love and that's the reason why he actually won the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL: And we have to see more of that just that we're going to push back, we're going to push book no matter what you say and how you try to smear people because these are legitimately good people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's all shaming, it's public shaming. I'll tell you who is pushing back, Kanye West. He's calling it the mob. Let's talk about his Make America Great moment. The rapper face backlash for praising President Trump yesterday posting on Twitter. Here's what he said, Kanye West. You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob cannot make me not love him. We are both dragging energy, he is my brother, I love everyone, I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals and we have the right to independent thought. Amen to Kanye West. Good for him.</p><p>CALDWELL: Amen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He goes on to -- and then the President actually responded, and the President tweeted out, thank you, Kanye. Very cool. Gianno, your reaction.</p><p>CALDWELL: You know, it's interesting. I'm in my hometown at Chicago right now and of course this is where Kanye is from. And I'll be talking about this on largest urban radio station after this interview but this is I think excellent. And I'll tell you why I think it's excellent. Kanye West has been an individual who's not willing to back down, he's unrelenting in what he believes. And I think that the degree, he really appreciates that in President Trump more than anything.</p><p>We saw in the 2016 election as I mentioned before, President Trump did not back down, whatsoever and I wrote a piece about him in the Hill why the Republican base (INAUDIBLE) it won't break and he read it and sent me a note. And in that piece, I said that the Republicans chose him as the guy that they wanted to win elections because after the media began to attack him and he was losing business deals, he lost millions saying what he believes.</p><p>He didn't step back like most businessmen would, he didn't step back like most politicians would, he doubled down on it. And with that being the case, then says that I'm unapologetic in my view, I'm unapologetic in American First policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL: And I'm unapologetic keeping our country safe. And I think most people can appreciate that, most people can evaluate that and most people voted for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Gianno though, it's Dagen. Never forget, Kanye is always about Kanye. Kanye is not about -- he is not -- he is not standing up for any issue quite frankly, he is doing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's a shame. He's pushing back on shaming, calling them the mob.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I argue that he is doing it for the attention because he knows that basically siding with President Trump will get him the most attention. Going after President Obama will get him the most attention. He isn't married to the Kardashian clan after all. Maybe they're learning from him rather than the other way around.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But this also started after the USA communications director Candace Owens, she hit back at the Democratic Party and she defend-- she was Fox last night with Martha. Listen to how she defended Kanye and what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CANDACE OWENS, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Once they inflate our body's Democratic Party, let's say they haven't slayed our minds, they have told true who we must love, who we must hate, what we must think, what ideas are unacceptable. In the long run, it just -- it just doesn't add up. Listen, I think differently, Kanye West thinks differently. I can guarantee you if he and I get in the same room, we will have a lot of disagreements. The one thing that we will celebrate is our right to think differently. I don't understand what's so controversial for the left to understand this. The way that they had demonized him in the last 72 hours, it's almost sickening but at the end of the day it's going to have adverse effects. I can guarantee you that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well said, Candace. Gianno, what do you make of all of this?</p><p>CALDWELL: I agree with what Candace has said and I'm going to have to push back on Dagen just a -- just a bit respectfully. Kanye is about himself, that's unquestionable. I know we all realize that. However, this is an individual who definitely has gone against ever since I have known him before he became a national figure. The marginalization of thought. Specifically marginalization of who we are as individuals so often as the society were programmed.</p><p>I believe to do what's reasonable and what were pretty much taught in school and I think he goes beyond that and says look, let's look deep inside ourselves and fulfill our greatest potential. And generally speaking when you do that, when you legitimately do that, it's going to make people uncomfortable and say, hey what you're doing is unreasonable and maybe you should rethink your decision but generally speaking the greatest folks we've seen, Mark Zuckerberg, Kanye West, Donald Trump, the individuals that really succeeded become these megastars are the ones that go beyond what's public as a final thought.</p><p>FREEMAN: All right. James Freeman here at the Journal. I'm not sure why we're talking about Kanye allegedly being all about himself. I mean, I don't know -- I don't know what's in his head but the idea that someone puts out a message that compliments the President, encourages people to think freely, and says he loves everyone. Or why are you saying -- well, he's about himself?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You can ask me that question because I'm the one who said it --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- James because he does -- he does and says things to garner the most attention. And so being complimentary in this environment, President Obama is not going to garner him the most attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I'm not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think he has courage by saying it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He has to --</p><p>FREEMAN: It's triggering a very important conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But -- he -- Kanye West has never lacked courage. I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying that there's always a motive and it is about -- Kanye is not right or left, not Democrat or Republican, Kanye is Kanye at the end of the day.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALDWELL: He has an album that's coming out and he loves --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. The album is coming out.</p><p>CALDWELL: -- due to his compliments in the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this -- they shame you if you say anything positive about the President. You know, you get shamed online if you say anything positive about the President. I like to see somebody, who pushes back because it's wrong.</p><p>CALDWELL: And he's is breaking the mode on that, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. He's breaking --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALDWELL: Because we've got -- we've gone to an extreme point in time where you can't say anything complimentary about President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then there's Former FBI Director Jim Comey who's been trashing the President in every interview and he leaked memos, a catalyst for the special counsel investigation. That memo was more wildly shared than we thought initially. Sources telling Fox News Comey likely gave the documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another person along with the with Columbia Law School professor and watch Comey struggle to defend his actions last night at a CNN town hall. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: You did leak memos, I mean, is it OK for somebody at the FBI to leak something, an internal document even if it's not classified? Isn't that leaking?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: It was a whole lot wrong with your question, Anderson. First, I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to communicate the substance of one unclassified</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMEY: I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that it'd be out in media, I wanted it to get in the media. As a private citizen, I could do that and did that just as I have written about it in my book.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does he think just saying this is going to make people think otherwise? We're -- we saw what happened. Gianno, your reaction.</p><p>CALDWELL: That is my definition leaking. He gave information and now, this is developing at the harvest of the FBI and he gave it to a friend, to spring this special counsel and if I -- if I recall correctly, I think it was reported at The Washington -- Wall Street Journal who said after reading the Comey memos, there is -- they see no reason why there should have been a special counsel to begin with. So with that being the case, Jim Comey definitely is in a position where he's losing all credibility if he had any left.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And let's not forget that zero intelligence that was used to launch the investigation which Devin Nunes told us about. Gianno, thank you. Good to see you.</p><p>CALDWELL: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.</p><p>CALDWELL: Good seeing you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A massive dragnet in Maine after a man shot and killed a sheriff's deputy. Cheryl Casone with the story now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. Police are on the lookout for this man, John Williams. They say that the 29-year-old gunned down Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine. That is just North of Augusta. Williams drove the cruiser to a nearby convenience store and he robbed it. Police releasing this photo, this captured of him from inside of the stolen car. He then abandoned that car nearby, he has not been seen since. Deputy Cole had been on the force 13 years. He leaves behind a son. The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot at a Dallas Home Depot, one of them was killed there. Officer Rogelio Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest. 22 officers have been shot and killed so far this year. That is more than double from the same time last year and on average, you're not going to believe this, at least one officer has reportedly been shot to death every week in 2018.</p><p>Well, earning season is in high gear this morning. We're just getting results from a couple of big airlines, you know, and let's start with American, the stock is trading lower almost 4-1/2 percent to the downside in the premarket. Their first quarter revenue just missed the street estimate. Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents actually topped expectations, not helping out though. Let's take a look at Southwest, they also are under pressure ahead of the opening bell down more than 3-1/2 percent. Revenue coming up short of estimates. Southwest did add -- the bookings are down after an engine on its one planes exploded last week killing a passenger and that was Southwest's first fatality in the carrier's history.</p><p>And then finally there's this. You want to be careful, the next car that you hop in to might be Megatron. Japanese engineers created a real life Transformer that can actually carry people onboard. This is the first scene we've ever seen anything like this. It's a robot car. It walks over 18 miles an hour and transforms into a sports car with people still inside. The robot creator says he was yes inspired by his childhood Transformer heroes that he watched in the movies in growing up. There you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, very cool.</p><p>CASONE: Very cool. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up. The outlook on trade with China, big delegation going next week. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers will weigh in on the new report that Chinese companies are already reconsidering investments in the American market as Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary gets set to visit his counterpart in China next week. Then founding partner of AlphaOne Capital Partners Dan Niles joins me to talk about Facebook's quarterly results, he predicted the company would beat. I'll get his take on the company's surging revenue and where it goes next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Focus on Facebook. The social media company beat earnings and revenue expectations last night despite the fallout from the privacy scandal. Yesterday, Facebook reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.69 on revenue of $11.97 billion. That was the first quarter of 2018. Shares of Facebook right now are up seven percent in the premarket. Joining us right now on the telephone is the founding partner of AlphaOne Capital Partners, Dan Niles. One of his big positions is Facebook. And Dan, good to have you. Thanks very much for weighing in here. You predicted that the company would beat revenue and earnings expectations. What's your take away from the numbers?</p><p>DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDING PARTNER (via telephone): I mean, quite honestly, it's even better than what I was expecting. You have to look at the revenues first and revenues year-over-year in the June quarter were up 45 percent. And the September and December quarters, accelerated up 47 percent. And what's interesting is even with all the negative publicity around the supposed data scandal, the revenues accelerates 50 percent year over year in (INAUDIBLE) they keep the operating income by about 14 percent where their margins were better than expected and they keep the ETF by over 20 percent. I mean, back out some of the one time. So it's really hard to find a whole lot negative in the report.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about expenses going forward in this whole regulatory scrutiny? I mean, are we going to see, you know, new rules regulations that this company is going to have to adhere to in the entire industry, we'll have to adhere to that will change the reason to own the stock because expenses are higher?</p><p>NILES: Yes. I really don't think so. I mean, here is a way to think about it. Even though expenses they guided to up 50 to 60 percent, originally they guided up 45 to 60. Estimates are actually going up after this print because they beat the operating income margins by so much that even though their guiding expenses higher most of the street is actually raising EPS.</p><p>The second thing is, I'm sure there will be some extra regulations they need to adhere to, obviously they talk on the call about the general protection regulations coming out on May 25th in Europe but the interesting thing as they said, even with those regulations, they don't anticipate those changes really significantly impacting our revenue, they do think daily active users could be cracked down in the second quarter but, you know, that's really not affecting the revenues.</p><p>And quite honestly the extra regulations with them, it will -- it will help make their site a lot safer and to some extent it's going to impact their smaller competitors a lot more. They don't have same resources as Facebook to comply with that.</p><p>FREEMAN: Hi, Dan. James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal. I'd like to talk about those potential smaller competitors. Normally those kind of fat profit margins attract competition. Who is it that can challenge Facebook, either among startups or existing tech giants moving into their business.</p><p>NILES: Well, I mean, you obviously know the list of characters, you've got Twitter, you've got Snapchat obviously, two public companies talked about most often. But I mean, they've been competing since the beginning and you've obviously seen this market is, you know, not necessarily winner take post but it's sort evolving that way as Facebook continues to execute and they're executing really across all of the metrics. So it's not just growing revenue but they're highly, highly profitable.</p><p>They have 46 percent operating marks. And so -- and you have to remember, to some extent they are a startup in different businesses, so we talked about Facebook, they've got 2.2 billion users and Instagram 800 million users, so that's great. What we don't talk about that much is the 1.3 billion users for Facebook messenger is that they just started to make money off of and they make absolutely no money off of the 1.5 billion WhatsApp users.</p><p>So they've got -- to some extent two startups buried within the company between Messenger and WhatsApp that they still haven't really started to monetize yet and that gives me a lot of comfort especially when you look at the multiples of trading at 20 times non-gap, you know, under 18 earnings. Markets up 17. These are growing the top line at 50 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: The world is wash in venture capital. Are new competitors being funded? And if not, why not? Is Facebook seen as so dominate that that won't work?</p><p>NILES: Yes. I mean, I think people are trying to work around the edges but you have to remember with Facebook, there is something pretty unique which is the network effect. You're not going to get off of Facebook and go to Google plus if your friends aren't there. So, you can't really easily switch. If you're dealing with Google for example and somebody came out with a much better search engine, you know, there's nothing to stop you from going to the other one, the problem with this is that even if somebody didn't develop a great other alternative social media site, you're not going to move unless all of your friends move too. And that's probably not going to happen immediately. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dan, real quick. Intel and Microsoft after the bell tonight, good quarters? What are you expecting?</p><p>NILES: Yes. I mean, Intel is one of our largest positions. We like it quite a bit. I think the real key for Intel is enterprise demand has been really bad for the last couple years. That really started to improve in the fourth quarter and I think it's going to be very good for this year. So we like Intel a lot and it's got a low multiple as well in this environment at about 14 times. So we like that quite a bit and Microsoft, similarly we think they should have a pretty solid quarter. A multiple is quite a bit higher at 24 times, so not as preferred to us as Intel.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Dan, always great to talk with you. Thanks so much.</p><p>NILES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We appreciate it. Dan Niles joining us there. AlphaOne Capital. Coming up. House Republican Conference chair and Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rogders joins me next. We'll get her take on French President Macron's state visit with President Trump, trade, and a lot more. Then a new twist on coffee just in time for summer. Starbucks introducing cold foam before reporting earnings after the bell tonight. We break down the expectations. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, April 26th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast. It is the single busiest day for first-quarter earnings, General Motors and Pepsico among the companies reporting their first-quarter this morning. G.M. beat expectations, while PepsiCo was mixed. Both stocks are under some selling pressure this morning by a fraction. Investors are waiting on big tech. Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all reporting, after the close tonight, all the stocks are trading up about two percent right now.</p><p>Broader markets this morning are higher. March durable goods just came out up 2.6 percent versus an estimate of 1.6 percent that was better than expected. The news is a positive for markets, and we are seeing a pretty good tone today. The Dow Industrials set to open about 50 points, that's a quarter of a percent higher.</p><p>The S&amp;P is up a third of a percent right now. And the NASDAQ up 50 points, that's three-quarters of one percent. The Dow yesterday snapped a five-day losing streak. And the momentum continues today. That was lifted by Boeing's big earnings beat. Boeing's stock did well as did the Dow up 60 points at the close, a quarter of a percent higher. The S&amp;P was also fractionally better on the day. The NASDAQ yesterday, closed lower by three points.</p><p>In Europe, this morning, the major indices are higher. The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, and Mario Draghi is about to speak in his press conference. FT-100 up 7-1/2, CAC Quarante up 35, that's two-thirds of a percent. And the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a percent, 43 points higher. In Asia overnight, markets were mixed. The worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>President Trump lashing out against Jim Comey. He's targeting the former FBI Director on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago. We will tell you what the President just told our colleagues there. And breaking news this morning, Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. President Trump weighed in on the announcement earlier this hour on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" he placed the blame squarely on Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I even told them a day or two ago. I saw this was -- where this was going. And you know they're very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again first in his class at West Point, top in class at Harvard Law School, a brilliant guy, a great guy, and somebody I get along with very well. You know, Mike got through and they thought they had him stopped. The Democrats are obstructionists. It's horrible what they're doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Reaction from Capitol Hill coming up this morning. And then just in time for summer, Starbucks added -- adds cold foam. The details ahead of the company's earnings report later this hour. The stock is up, half of a percent. Plus, it is National Pretzel Day. We are celebrating pretzel day here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Wait until you see this pretzel that they made of my face. I don't -- I don't think it looks like me but let me see if I can grab this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is Pretzel Day. There you go. OK, we'll get to that coming up this morning, but first, our top story right now, President Trump lashing out at Jim Comey, this morning. Here's what he had to say about the fired FBI Director in a new interview this morning with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Comey is a leaker and he's a liar. And not only on this stuff, he's been leaking for years. He's probably been using his friend, the so- called professor, who now turns out to have FBI clearance which he never said. He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress, he said he gave it to a friend. And he gave it to a friend to leak classified information. It is all classified, it was totally classified. So, he illegally -- he did an illegal act, and he said it himself, in order to get a special counsel against me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is House Republican Conference Chair and Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Good to see you, Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p>REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R), WASHINGTON, CHAIR, HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on this. You know, I was actually really struck by the interview last night that Comey did with CNN, and basically he said, no, I didn't leak anything but then went on to talk about how, in fact, he did leak these memos that he wrote which as soon as an FBI Director writes a memo in FBI, you know, headquarters, that is the property of the FBI, but he said he passed it on to his friend and told his friend, oh, just get this to the New York Times but don't actually give them the paper, and he said that's not leaking. Your reaction.</p><p>RODGERS: Well, it's -- yes, it begs a lot of questions. And in someone who believes it's so important that we are restoring trust, that we're restoring the rule of law in this country, the FBI is the highest law enforcement agency. This is -- the people within the FBI must be held to the highest standards, and that is what causes me so much dismay right now is just the cloud that is over the FBI, and the questions that it has raised. We need the men and women there to act in the utmost authority, as well as transparency and accountability to the American people. And so, yes, he clearly leaked, and it raises a lot of questions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But is there going to be any accountability here, Congresswoman? I mean, look, last weekend, I had your colleague, Congressman Devin Nunes on my Sunday morning program and he said, after looking at all the electronic communications, he realized that there was no intelligence used to actually launch an investigation into the Trump campaign. So, what happens now? I mean, can we just keep seeing, you know, people at the top of these important agencies abuse their power with no accountability?</p><p>RODGERS: No one is above the law and they must be held accountable. And that's the role of Congress, that's the role of the elected representatives of the people within the House to make sure that we are taking action to hold them accountable. So, both in the Intelligence Committee as well as the government oversight and reform committee which Trey Gowdy is the chairman of, that's where these questions are asked and that's where there's been frustration, that documents have not been turned over, that people have not been as forthright in answering the questions, but it is up to us to make sure that people are held accountable and that no one is above the law.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we'll be watching what develops then. Then there is this, the breaking news this breaking news this morning, Congresswoman, and that is Dr. Ronny Jackson withdrawing his name for consideration for the head of the V.A., President Trump's pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs pulled his nomination in the last hour amid all of these questions surrounding his professional conduct. Congresswoman, your reaction to this news?</p><p>RODGERS: I respect his decision. It's most important that we get someone at the V.A. Again, we need to restore trust between the veterans and this agency whose mission is to serve our veterans. And as someone who represents nearly 70,000 veterans in eastern Washington, I hear regularly from veterans who feel like when they contact the V.A. that they're more of a burden than actually having the red carpet rolled out for them. So, we need someone to head up the V.A., we need to get focused on the mission of the V.A., and make sure that our veterans, those who have served are getting the care that they need when the time comes, that has to be a top priority for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I mean, can we just ignore all of the barriers and the booby traps that the left is putting in place for the Trump administration? I mean, look at all of the positions that are yet unfilled. Look at all of the slow walking going on in terms of getting his nominees passed. You know, Mike Pompeo got -- you know, got support, but it was close. I mean, what about that, who is doing this? We know that three administrations have said how great Dr. Ronny Jackson is and all of a sudden, somebody leaks all of this speculation about his personal life.</p><p>RODGERS: Well, that is -- yes, that's tough to see, and I respect his decision just to pull out. I am concerned that the left is putting politics ahead of what's best for the country, and there's so many -- there's the V.A. position, Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, he's an honorable man, a well-respected leader, he's proven himself, and yet too many were willing to put politics ahead of what was best for the country. We do need to get these people in place because that is part of making sure that President Trump has the people around him to actually lead, and people equal policy and he needs these people in place so that we can keep moving forward. There's a lot on our plate right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think people are figuring this out, that there's -- all of these booby traps that are being put in by the skeptics and critics of President Trump. And then there's China, of course, reportedly threatening to \"fierce counterstrike\" if the President goes ahead with these another $100 billion in tariffs as punishment for the alleged intellectual property theft. Congressman, your thoughts on this. I know Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary and a whole delegation are going next week to meet with their counterparts in China to talk this out.</p><p>RODGERS: Right. Well, there's too many examples of illegal practices by China, where we have seen them taking our intellectual property and duplicating it. I have examples in Eastern Washington, Washington State, and it destroys companies here in America. I am encouraged that President Trump is focused on making sure that we hold China accountable. I have had concerns about the across-the-board approach to tariffs that, you know, he was talking about imposing upon steel and aluminum. I do believe it needs to be more targeted but we must hold a country like China accountable for illegal practices or free and fair trade will never work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bottom line, do you think that the President with his tough talk and the team is going to be able to account that budget deficit with China, which is already now up to 375 billion?</p><p>RODGERS: Well, if anyone can do it, I believe it's President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes,</p><p>RODGERS: And he is focused on this. I had the chance to spend some time with Larry Kudlow just last week. I'm really pleased to see him as the head of the economic advisors, his chief economic adviser. He understands economics, world trade, and also what's going on in China. And he basically told us everything is on the table, tariffs, no tariffs, sanctions, but we must hold them accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he's going to be on that trip as well, Larry Kudlow, and Peter Navarro. What about this budget about face, Congresswoman? President Trump is now urging lawmakers to rescind some of the spending of that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill which he signed last month. Congresswoman, are there enough votes to make it happen and obviously you must be getting just as much pushback as so many others are, for signing that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill with all the spending?</p><p>RODGERS: Right. Well, we must address the spending in this country. It is the number one threat that faces us, both from a military perspective as well as economic perspective, we needed to get a budget in place, but it spends too much, and that's where I am -- I'm actually encouraged that the President, Mick Mulvaney is leading on putting together a rescission package.</p><p>We should have been doing this all along, really taking a look at those opportunities to go into programs, go into agencies and actually through the House and the Senate, cut the spending. The budget process is broken, the House passed all 12 of our appropriations bills. We went through program by program, agency by agency, the Senate did zero. So, this has been very frustrating.</p><p>This is our fundamental job as the elected representatives, this is where we exercise the power of the purse, and yet this process is broken. So, I am -- I definitely want to look at what the President -- what they can propose. I think the House and Senate should also be using this tool of rescissions to take action that we can to reduce those deficits and reduce the debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his three-day state visit with an address to the joint meeting of Congress. How was it, what was your takeaway? He was critical of the President's planned withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>RODGERS: Well, I think, it is important that these conversations continue. I've never been a supporter of the Iran deal. I thought it was bad deal. It did not hold Iran accountable for not developing or obtaining nuclear weapons. And that's where we need our European allies to join us in making sure that we have a deal that is going to accomplish the goal of ensuring that they do not develop nuclear weapons. And right now, we do not have that confidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, real quick, who are you supporting for Speaker of the House?</p><p>RODGERS: Well, you know, I -- we need to make sure that we are voting on a Republican speaker after the elections, so we need to stay focused on the policy and on our midterms and making sure that we're getting that done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. Thanks so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Ford Motor now pulling all but two of its passenger cars from its North American line up as part of a plan to save money and make the company more competitive. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney. Stu, a car company canceling all of its cars?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: Yes. Well, you know, if you can't make money selling cars, I guess you forget about selling cars, and you go to light trucks and SUVs because that's where the money is. It's a perfectly rational move but boy, does it come as a shock. You know, when I think of the Ford Motor company, I think of the Taurus, one of the best-selling marks for almost a generation. It's gone. They're not going to sell that thing in North America any longer. The Fiesta is going. A couple of other marks, I guess you'd call them, are going. I was just shocked to hear that. It's a car company, but it's not a car company. It's now a light truck and SUV company because it wants to make some more money. Look at the stock, up 2-1/2 percent, just because its walking away from the car market. I wondered if General Motors will do something similar or FiatChrysler, walk away from unprofitable lines because you got to make money in this environment and that's what you got to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's really fascinating.</p><p>VARNEY: I find it fascinating, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is -- it is fascinating. And remember the last CEO wanted to make it a mobility company.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, that's right. Yes. My, how times change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes. I know you'll have a lot more on it.</p><p>VARNEY: Sure, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Join Stuart. It is the busiest day of the earnings season today, G.M. one of the big names out this morning. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the numbers. Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. The busiest day of 68 S&amp;P 500 companies, and to your point, your chat with Stuart, guess what, G.M. is doing much of the same, focusing on a highly-profitable pickup trucks, and that's what's costing them going forward for 2018. So, for the quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line. Profit was on the rise, and it's the high-margin vehicles that they're going to be working on. So, 2018, they expect that they will have flat profits but expect the all new pickup trucks would boost the margins in 2019. The stock is down a half of one percent.</p><p>Then, let's take a look at Starbucks. So, we're expecting for Starbucks to report after the bell today. Global same-store sales are likely on the rise to the tune of about 1.8 percent. They still, obviously or have the P.R. that they have to deal with from Philadelphia, removing those two black men, but big spot is China. That's where they see the growth. In fact, they're opening one new store in China every 15 hours. And also, you can get cold foam on your new -- on your new Starbucks. All right, Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Nicole. So, coming up, it's not your average day. We are celebrating National Pretzel Day. Maria's pretzel with a small business is growing fast. We take you live to plaza, where there is a pretzel truck waiting. I've already eaten one, they're delicious. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We're coming to you outside on the plaza, outside headquarters. What a twist in this National Pretzel Day. We are celebrating in style with a small business that is growing fast. Joining me right now is Dan Dizio, he's the CEO and co-founder of Philly Pretzel Factory and we've got the team here ready to munch on all pretzels. Dan, great to see you.</p><p>DAN DIZIO, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY: Me, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us, and I love the MORNINGS WITH MARIA in pretzel. That is very cool, nice touch. You've been selling pretzels since you're 11 on the corner in Philadelphia. Tell us how you started your business.</p><p>DIZIO: Yes, my next door neighbor had a pretzel bakery, got stuck with a bunch of pretzels. I'm 47 now. This week, I'll be 47. And he got stuck. A woman asked if I would sell them on the shoe corner and we would split the money. And my mom said it would be OK. He had to ask my mom permission, and, for some reasons, my mom said it would be OK to stand on the street corner all day (INAUDIBLE) but she said it was a different time back then. So --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIZIO: And, yes, I did it, and did real well, and the next thing I know every guy was selling pretzels, and did all through middle school and high school. And I went to college and was a graduate, and had a stockbroker job and just didn't like the 9:00 to 5:00 thing, and I want to get back to the pretzel business and I talked my college roommate into doing a pretzel business and that's how it started, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You started with the food truck, the Philly Pretzel Factory, you've got the food truck -- Hi, everybody. Did you have a pretzel? Tell me about the food truck business because this is a really successful way to sell.</p><p>DIZIO: Yes, we've had the truck for a few years now. We're really doing well with the weddings, bar mitzvahs, just different event. I mean, there's different places we could take it, so it'd be mobile. That's the way you have to be in this moment right now as for -- be able to (INAUDIBLE) and be able to bring the pretzel to the people where they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And now, you have 170 locations across the country.</p><p>DIZIO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're opening more stores.</p><p>DIZIO: Yes, we're actually opening up 25 in New York right now. We just did area development deal to open up 25 in Manhattan over the next few years. So, we're excited about that. And we have about 42 stores under development. So, we're really excited.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: How long does it take to actually bake a pretzel?</p><p>DIZIO: It takes about seven minutes to bake a pretzel. Yes, yes.</p><p>CASONE: OK. Some of these. OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: And some sausage, am I right?</p><p>DIZIO: They're hotdogs.</p><p>CASONE: I'm digging it.</p><p>DIZIO: They're hotdogs. (INAUDIBLE) This is a new product we had. It's our mini hotdog trade. We've done really well over the years with hotdog pretzels.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a mini-hotdog stand. I like that.</p><p>DIZIO: And we do many hotdogs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fit for a party.</p><p>DIZIO: That's exactly what it's meant for. Tailgating parties. It's been a big hit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the Republican tax plan, did that impact you as a small business?</p><p>DIZIO: It actually did. I mean, more money for the small businesses. Remember, our franchisees are business owners and there are small businesses in communities, and to be able to have a tax break for them, really lets them reinvest, maybe open another location up, reinvest. I mean, these are part of the community, these franchise locations. I mean, they sponsored the little league. They have more money to do these things and it really does have that effect to help everything in their communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where does the growth come from now?</p><p>DIZIO: It's -- we're doing a lot in Midwest, a lot down south. I mean, Philadelphia has been haven for pretzels and it is where it all started. So, we're stretching out, we're in 19 states now and it continues to grow and people are fascinated and falling in love with the (INAUDIBLE) once we had --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: These are so good, Maria. We have to get involved. These are so good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dan Dizio, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIZIO: Thank you. It's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wait, can I have the (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- MORNINGS WITH MARIA. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. These are just out of the oven. Stuart Varney, over to you. Do you want to have pretzels?</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. Delivery, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll have it set up for you.</p><p>VARNEY: Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Take it away, Stu.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018042603cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S66-RXC1-JB20-G3N2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8055\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 26, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good Thursday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  April 26.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m.  on the East Coast.   Earnings in focus on Wall Street.  Futures indicated to open stronger this  morning.  Stocks are expected to be up at the start of trading with Dow up  55, NASDAQ up 42.  Technology bigwigs, Amazon and Microsoft headlining the  biggest earning season of -- earnings day of the season rather.  This is  the single busiest earnings day of the quarter.  Both are due out after the  bell tonight.  We'll be watching those.  General Motors meanwhile beat  expectations last hour.  The stock is under pressure however over the  automaker's high restructuring expenses, stock down two percent.</p><p>Facebook meanwhile, shaking off the scandal.  Shares soaring in the  premarket up almost seven percent after the company beat expectations  yesterday and posted strong growth in daily users.  Take a look at European  indices this morning after the ECB left interest rates unchanged last hour,  the Ft-100 now changed very much.  The CAC quarante is up about a half of a  percent and the DAX Index up a quarter of a percent.  We are waiting on the  ECB President Mario Draghi to start his news conference, that starts in  about 30 minutes and we'll tell you if there's anything else that he says  that might be market moving.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  Shanghai Composite was the worst performer down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump's pick to head the Department  of Veterans Affairs has pulled his name out of consideration.  The details  as Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination in a growing scrutiny from  lawmakers.  And the West Wing, Kanye not backing down from his support of  President Trump.  The Rapper's powerful message to his critics coming up.   A new robot that's more than meets the eye how scientists in Japan created  a real life transformer.  All of those coming up this morning and joining  me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall  Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman along with  Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth.  Great  to see you guys.  </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And great show so far.  We got a lot on the docket.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Sad story about Ronny Jackson.   This guy has really  served his country honorably and well and this is how Washington treats him  on the way out.  Just horrendous.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that is the news of the moment. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know if he's going to remain the doctor at the White  House but really, he didn't deserve this.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Well, it's a way for some people to try and  discourage from anybody serving in the Trump administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  A way to create chaos in President Trump's  administration.  That is the breaking news.  Dr. Ronny Jackson has  withdrawn as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Blake Burman is  live at the White House with all the details right now.  And Blake, the  news just broke about 10 minutes ago.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.  And Ronny Jackson has put out a  statement within the last few minutes here, Maria.  the bottom line with  this was the allegations just continue to pile and pile up against Dr.  Jackson who is the White House doctor had served under President George W.  Bush, President Obama, and now as the personal doctor as well to President  Trump who nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The  allegations were that he was drinking on the job, overprescribing medicine,  fostering a hostile work environment.  </p><p>Jackson had denied all of that but this morning says he does not want to go  forward with this process.  In a statement Jackson says the following,  \"going into the process, I expected tough questions about how to best care  for our veterans but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and  anonymous attacks on my character and integrity.  </p><p>He goes on to say, \"the allegations against me are completely false and  fabricating.  If they had any merit, I would not have been selected,  promoted, and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as  physician to three Presidents over the past 12 years.\"  The White House  throughout all of this over the last few days continues to stand by  Jackson, there was a Press Secretary Sarah Sanders joining the briefing  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Through Jackson's  record as a White House physician has been impeccable.  In fact because Dr.  Jackson has worked within arm's reach of three Presidents, he has received  more vetting than most nominees.  Given this unique position of trust and  responsibility, Dr. Jackson's background and character were evaluated  during three different administrations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  One thing that keep in mind here, Maria, is before all of these  allegations started rolling in and before the folks up on Capitol Hill put  a temporary pause on the nomination process.  There were serious questions  about whether or not Jackson was qualified to handle such a huge  bureaucracy.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, the President during that  news conference with Emmanuel Macron backed Jackson by saying look, this is  his decision to make, he is a qualified to lead this department and we will  find out from Jackson what he decides to do.  This morning, we have found  out he has pulled his name out from the nomination process and now the  White House has yet another open slot to fill, someone to lead the V.A.   Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that is exactly what the left and the resist movement wants  as much chaos as possible around the Trump administration.  Joining us  right now is Gianno Caldwell, we just saw in the moment.  Gianno, thanks  very much for being here this morning.  Fox News Political Analyst,  Republican strategists, Caldwell strategic consulting founder.  Your  reaction to this.  I mean, obviously, this is more -- booby traps in the  Trump administration.  Who leaked all of this or created this around Dr.  Ronny Jackson forcing him to withdraw in your view? </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  We've seen leaks throughout  this entire start of this administration.  And I think it's very  unfortunate.  Further, I think Sarah Sanders said something that was  particularly interesting and I -- and I thought to be very true that Dr.  Ronny Jackson is an individual who's been vetted by three administrations.   So if these were to be true why wasn't that found to be the case in these  other vetting processes?  So it's something that I think that's obviously  harmful to the Trump administration because we've seen nominees put their  name in and have to withdraw.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  So that particularly problematic.  And I'm sad to see him go but  I know that there are some other good people that can step in his place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  I think an excellent candidate with V.P. to be the new V.A.  secretary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, exact -- well, we talked about that earlier, you're  absolutely right.  But I mean, is -- are the people going to -- going to  come forward and make noise about this?  How is this going to stop with all  of these, you know, booby traps and barriers that the resist movement is  putting in place for the Trump administration? </p><p>HEGSETH:  I think your only option in situation like this is to fight back  and fight back ferociously because it isn't just the leaks, it isn't just  the Obama administration.  Do watch other networks --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The media.</p><p>HEGSETH:  They go wall-to-wall on person speculation, anonymously source  with no verification to smear this guy.  I was forced to watch one of these  other networks yesterday for whatever reason and they didn't stop, it was  all Ronny Jackson, all based on nothing.  Gianno, how do you overcome that  in this environment?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know what, I think that's why it's been President Trump's  best quality.  You saw that through the 2015 election where they would  smear him, they would come at him hard and he wouldn't back down.  And I  think that that President Trump is going to people who love and that's the  reason why he actually won the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And we have to see more of that just that we're going to push  back, we're going to push book no matter what you say and how you try to  smear people because these are legitimately good people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all shaming, it's public shaming.  I'll tell you who  is pushing back, Kanye West.  He's calling it the mob.  Let's talk about  his Make America Great moment.  The rapper face backlash for praising  President Trump yesterday posting on Twitter.  Here's what he said, Kanye  West.  You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob cannot make me not  love him.  We are both dragging energy, he is my brother, I love everyone,  I don't agree with everything anyone does.  That's what makes us  individuals and we have the right to independent thought.  Amen to Kanye  West.  Good for him.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Amen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He goes on to -- and then the President actually responded, and  the President tweeted out, thank you, Kanye.  Very cool.  Gianno, your  reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know, it's interesting.  I'm in my hometown at Chicago right  now and of course this is where Kanye is from.  And I'll be talking about  this on largest urban radio station after this interview but this is I  think excellent.  And I'll tell you why I think it's excellent.  Kanye West  has been an individual who's not willing to back down, he's unrelenting in  what he believes.  And I think that the degree, he really appreciates that  in President Trump more than anything.  </p><p>We saw in the 2016 election as I mentioned before, President Trump did not  back down, whatsoever and I wrote a piece about him in the Hill why the  Republican base (INAUDIBLE) it won't break and he read it and sent me a  note.  And in that piece, I said that the Republicans chose him as the guy  that they wanted to win elections because after the media began to attack  him and he was losing business deals, he lost millions saying what he  believes.  </p><p>He didn't step back like most businessmen would, he didn't step back like  most politicians would, he doubled down on it.  And with that being the  case, then says that I'm unapologetic in my view, I'm unapologetic in  American First policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And I'm unapologetic keeping our country safe.  And I think most  people can appreciate that, most people can evaluate that and most people  voted for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gianno though, it's Dagen.  Never forget, Kanye is always about  Kanye.  Kanye is not about -- he is not -- he is not standing up for any  issue quite frankly, he is doing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a shame.  He's pushing back on shaming, calling them  the mob.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I argue that he is doing it for the attention because he knows  that basically siding with President Trump will get him the most attention.   Going after President Obama will get him the most attention.  He isn't  married to the Kardashian clan after all.  Maybe they're learning from him  rather than the other way around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But this also started after the USA communications  director Candace Owens, she hit back at the Democratic Party and she  defend-- she was Fox last night with Martha.  Listen to how she defended  Kanye and what she said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CANDACE OWENS, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Once they inflate our body's  Democratic Party, let's say they haven't slayed our minds, they have told  true who we must love, who we must hate, what we must think, what ideas are  unacceptable.  In the long run, it just -- it just doesn't add up.  Listen,  I think differently, Kanye West thinks differently.  I can guarantee you if  he and I get in the same room, we will have a lot of disagreements.  The  one thing that we will celebrate is our right to think differently.  I  don't understand what's so controversial for the left to understand this.   The way that they had demonized him in the last 72 hours, it's almost  sickening but at the end of the day it's going to have adverse effects.  I  can guarantee you that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well said, Candace.  Gianno, what do you make of all of this?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  I agree with what Candace has said and I'm going to have to push  back on Dagen just a -- just a bit respectfully.  Kanye is about himself,  that's unquestionable.  I know we all realize that.  However, this is an  individual who definitely has gone against ever since I have known him  before he became a national figure.  The marginalization of thought.   Specifically marginalization of who we are as individuals so often as the  society were programmed.  </p><p>I believe to do what's reasonable and what were pretty much taught in  school and I think he goes beyond that and says look, let's look deep  inside ourselves and fulfill our greatest potential.  And generally  speaking when you do that, when you legitimately do that, it's going to  make people uncomfortable and say, hey what you're doing is unreasonable  and maybe you should rethink your decision but generally speaking the  greatest folks we've seen, Mark Zuckerberg, Kanye West, Donald Trump, the  individuals that really succeeded become these megastars are the ones that  go beyond what's public as a final thought.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.  James Freeman here at the Journal.  I'm not sure why  we're talking about Kanye allegedly being all about himself.  I mean, I  don't know -- I don't know what's in his head but the idea that someone  puts out a message that compliments the President, encourages people to  think freely, and says he loves everyone.  Or why are you saying -- well,  he's about himself?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can ask me that question because I'm the one who said it --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- James because he does -- he does and says things to garner  the most attention.  And so being complimentary in this environment,  President Obama is not going to garner him the most attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he has courage by saying it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has to --</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's triggering a very important conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- he -- Kanye West has never lacked courage.  I'm not  arguing that.  I'm just saying that there's always a motive and it is about  -- Kanye is not right or left, not Democrat or Republican, Kanye is Kanye  at the end of the day.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  He has an album that's coming out and he loves --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. The album is coming out.</p><p>CALDWELL:  -- due to his compliments in the President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this -- they shame you if you say anything positive about  the President.  You know, you get shamed online if you say anything  positive about the President.  I like to see somebody, who pushes back  because it's wrong.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And he's is breaking the mode on that, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's breaking --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  Because we've got -- we've gone to an extreme point in time  where you can't say anything complimentary about President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Former FBI Director Jim Comey who's been  trashing the President in every interview and he leaked memos, a catalyst  for the special counsel investigation.  That memo was more wildly shared  than we thought initially.  Sources telling Fox News Comey likely gave the  documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another  person along with the with Columbia Law School professor and watch Comey  struggle to defend his actions last night at a CNN town hall.  Listen to  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  You did leak memos, I mean, is it OK for  somebody at the FBI to leak something, an internal document even if it's  not classified?  Isn't that leaking? </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  It was a whole lot wrong with your  question, Anderson.  First, I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to  communicate the substance of one unclassified </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that  it'd be out in media, I wanted it to get in the media.  As a private  citizen, I could do that and did that just as I have written about it in my  book.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does he think just saying this is going to make people think  otherwise?  We're -- we saw what happened.  Gianno, your reaction.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  That is my definition leaking.  He gave information and now,  this is developing at the harvest of the FBI and he gave it to a friend, to  spring this special counsel and if I -- if I recall correctly, I think it  was reported at The Washington -- Wall Street Journal who said after  reading the Comey memos, there is -- they see no reason why there should  have been a special counsel to begin with.  So with that being the case,  Jim Comey definitely is in a position where he's losing all credibility if  he had any left.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget that zero intelligence that was used  to launch the investigation which Devin Nunes told us about.  Gianno, thank  you.  Good to see you.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Good seeing you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive dragnet in Maine after a man shot and  killed a sheriff's deputy.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, John Williams.  They say that the 29-year-old gunned down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine.  That is just  North of Augusta.  Williams drove the cruiser to a nearby convenience store  and he robbed it.  Police releasing this photo, this captured of him from  inside of the stolen car.  He then abandoned that car nearby, he has not  been seen since.  Deputy Cole had been on the force 13 years. He leaves  behind a son.  The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot at  a Dallas Home Depot, one of them was killed there.  Officer Rogelio  Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him  in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest.  22 officers have  been shot and killed so far this year.  That is more than double from the  same time last year and on average, you're not going to believe this, at  least one officer has reportedly been shot to death every week in 2018.  </p><p>Well, earning season is in high gear this morning.  We're just getting  results from a couple of big airlines, you know, and let's start with  American, the stock is trading lower almost 4-1/2 percent to the downside  in the premarket.  Their first quarter revenue just missed the street  estimate.  Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents actually topped  expectations, not helping out though.  Let's take a look at Southwest, they  also are under pressure ahead of the opening bell down more than 3-1/2  percent.  Revenue coming up short of estimates.  Southwest did add -- the  bookings are down after an engine on its one planes exploded last week  killing a passenger and that was Southwest's first fatality in the  carrier's history.  </p><p>And then finally there's this.  You want to be careful, the next car that  you hop in to might be Megatron.  Japanese engineers created a real life  Transformer that can actually carry people onboard.  This is the first  scene we've ever seen anything like this.  It's a robot car.  It walks over  18 miles an hour and transforms into a sports car with people still inside.   The robot creator says he was yes inspired by his childhood Transformer  heroes that he watched in the movies in growing up.  There you have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, very cool.</p><p>CASONE:  Very cool.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  The outlook on trade with China, big delegation  going next week.  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers will weigh in on the  new report that Chinese companies are already reconsidering investments in  the American market as Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary gets set to  visit his counterpart in China next week.  Then founding partner of  AlphaOne Capital Partners Dan Niles joins me to talk about Facebook's  quarterly results, he predicted the company would beat.  I'll get his take  on the company's surging revenue and where it goes next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Focus on Facebook.  The social media company  beat earnings and revenue expectations last night despite the fallout from  the privacy scandal.  Yesterday, Facebook reported adjusted earnings per  share of $1.69 on revenue of $11.97 billion.  That was the first quarter of  2018.  Shares of Facebook right now are up seven percent in the premarket.   Joining us right now on the telephone is the founding partner of AlphaOne  Capital Partners, Dan Niles.  One of his big positions is Facebook.  And  Dan, good to have you.  Thanks very much for weighing in here.  You  predicted that the company would beat revenue and earnings expectations.   What's your take away from the numbers?</p><p>DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDING PARTNER (via telephone):  I  mean, quite honestly, it's even better than what I was expecting.  You have  to look at the revenues first and revenues year-over-year in the June  quarter were up 45 percent.  And the September and December quarters,  accelerated up 47 percent.  And what's interesting is even with all the  negative publicity around the supposed data scandal, the revenues  accelerates 50 percent year over year in (INAUDIBLE) they keep the  operating income by about 14 percent where their margins were better than  expected and they keep the ETF by over 20 percent.  I mean, back out some  of the one time.  So it's really hard to find a whole lot negative in the  report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about expenses going forward in this whole regulatory  scrutiny?  I mean, are we going to see, you know, new rules regulations  that this company is going to have to adhere to in the entire industry,  we'll have to adhere to that will change the reason to own the stock  because expenses are higher?</p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I really don't think so.  I mean, here is a way to think  about it.  Even though expenses they guided to up 50 to 60 percent,  originally they guided up 45 to 60.  Estimates are actually going up after  this print because they beat the operating income margins by so much that  even though their guiding expenses higher most of the street is actually  raising EPS.  </p><p>The second thing is, I'm sure there will be some extra regulations they  need to adhere to, obviously they talk on the call about the general  protection regulations coming out on May 25th in Europe but the interesting  thing as they said, even with those regulations, they don't anticipate  those changes really significantly impacting our revenue, they do think  daily active users could be cracked down in the second quarter but, you  know, that's really not affecting the revenues.  </p><p>And quite honestly the extra regulations with them, it will -- it will help  make their site a lot safer and to some extent it's going to impact their  smaller competitors a lot more.  They don't have same resources as Facebook  to comply with that. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Hi, Dan.  James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal.  I'd like to  talk about those potential smaller competitors.  Normally those kind of fat  profit margins attract competition.  Who is it that can challenge Facebook,  either among startups or existing tech giants moving into their business. </p><p>NILES:  Well, I mean, you obviously know the list of characters, you've got  Twitter, you've got Snapchat obviously, two public companies talked about  most often.  But I mean, they've been competing since the beginning and  you've obviously seen this market is, you know, not necessarily winner take  post but it's sort evolving that way as Facebook continues to execute and  they're executing really across all of the metrics.  So it's not just  growing revenue but they're highly, highly profitable.  </p><p>They have 46 percent operating marks. And so -- and you have to remember,  to some extent they are a startup in different businesses, so we talked  about Facebook, they've got 2.2 billion users and Instagram 800 million  users, so that's great.  What we don't talk about that much is the 1.3  billion users for Facebook messenger is that they just started to make  money off of and they make absolutely no money off of the 1.5 billion  WhatsApp users.  </p><p>So they've got -- to some extent two startups buried within the company  between Messenger and WhatsApp that they still haven't really started to  monetize yet and that gives me a lot of comfort especially when you look at  the multiples of trading at 20 times non-gap, you know, under 18 earnings.   Markets up 17.  These are growing the top line at 50 percent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The world is wash in venture capital.  Are new competitors being  funded?  And if not, why not?  Is Facebook seen as so dominate that that  won't work? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, I think people are trying to work around the edges  but you have to remember with Facebook, there is something pretty unique  which is the network effect.  You're not going to get off of Facebook and  go to Google plus if your friends aren't there.  So, you can't really  easily switch.  If you're dealing with Google for example and somebody came  out with a much better search engine, you know, there's nothing to stop you  from going to the other one, the problem with this is that even if somebody  didn't develop a great other alternative social media site, you're not  going to move unless all of your friends move too.  And that's probably not  going to happen immediately.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan, real quick.  Intel and Microsoft after the bell tonight,  good quarters?  What are you expecting? </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I mean, Intel is one of our largest positions.  We like it  quite a bit.  I think the real key for Intel is enterprise demand has been  really bad for the last couple years.  That really started to improve in  the fourth quarter and I think it's going to be very good for this year.   So we like Intel a lot and it's got a low multiple as well in this  environment at about 14 times.  So we like that quite a bit and Microsoft,  similarly we think they should have a pretty solid quarter.  A multiple is  quite a bit higher at 24 times, so not as preferred to us as Intel. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Dan, always great to talk  with you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>NILES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Dan Niles joining us there.  AlphaOne  Capital.  Coming up.  House Republican Conference chair and Washington  Congressman Cathy McMorris Rogders joins me next. We'll get her take on  French President Macron's state visit with President Trump, trade, and a  lot more.  Then a new twist on coffee just in time for summer.  Starbucks  introducing cold foam before reporting earnings after the bell tonight.  We  break down the expectations.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first-quarter earnings, General Motors and Pepsico among  the companies reporting their first-quarter this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations, while PepsiCo was mixed.  Both stocks are under some selling  pressure this morning by a fraction.  Investors are waiting on big tech.   Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all reporting, after the close tonight, all the  stocks are trading up about two percent right now.  </p><p>Broader markets this morning are higher.  March durable goods just came out  up 2.6 percent versus an estimate of 1.6 percent that was better than  expected.  The news is a positive for markets, and we are seeing a pretty  good tone today.  The Dow Industrials set to open about 50 points, that's a  quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up a third of a percent right now.  And the NASDAQ up 50 points,  that's three-quarters of one percent.  The Dow yesterday snapped a five-day  losing streak.  And the momentum continues today.  That was lifted by  Boeing's big earnings beat.  Boeing's stock did well as did the Dow up 60  points at the close, a quarter of a percent higher.  The S&amp;P was also  fractionally better on the day.  The NASDAQ yesterday, closed lower by  three points.  </p><p>In Europe, this morning, the major indices are higher.  The European  Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, and Mario Draghi is about to  speak in his press conference.  FT-100 up 7-1/2, CAC Quarante up 35, that's  two-thirds of a percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a  percent, 43 points higher.  In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The  worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>President Trump lashing out against Jim Comey.  He's targeting the former  FBI Director on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" moments ago.  We will tell you what the  President just told our colleagues there.  And breaking news this morning,  Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws his nomination as Secretary of Veterans  Affairs.  President Trump weighed in on the announcement earlier this hour  on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" he placed the blame squarely on Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I even told them a day or  two ago.  I saw this was -- where this was going.  And you know they're  very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again first in his class at West  Point, top in class at Harvard Law School, a brilliant guy, a great guy,  and somebody I get along with very well.  You know, Mike got through and  they thought they had him stopped.  The Democrats are obstructionists.   It's horrible what they're doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Capitol Hill coming up this morning.  And then  just in time for summer, Starbucks added -- adds cold foam.  The details  ahead of the company's earnings report later this hour.  The stock is up,  half of a percent.  Plus, it is National Pretzel Day.  We are celebrating  pretzel day here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Wait until you see this pretzel  that they made of my face.  I don't -- I don't think it looks like me but  let me see if I can grab this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is Pretzel Day.  There you go.  OK, we'll get to that coming  up this morning, but first, our top story right now, President Trump  lashing out at Jim Comey, this morning.  Here's what he had to say about  the fired FBI Director in a new interview this morning with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\"  moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Comey is a leaker and he's a liar.  And not only on this stuff,  he's been leaking for years.  He's probably been using his friend, the so- called professor, who now turns out to have FBI clearance which he never  said.  He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress, he  said he gave it to a friend.  And he gave it to a friend to leak classified  information.  It is all classified, it was totally classified.  So, he  illegally -- he did an illegal act, and he said it himself, in order to get  a special counsel against me. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is House Republican Conference Chair and  Washington Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Good to see you,  Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p>REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R), WASHINGTON, CHAIR, HOUSE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this.  You know, I was actually really struck  by the interview last night that Comey did with CNN, and basically he said,  no, I didn't leak anything but then went on to talk about how, in fact, he  did leak these memos that he wrote which as soon as an FBI Director writes  a memo in FBI, you know, headquarters, that is the property of the FBI, but  he said he passed it on to his friend and told his friend, oh, just get  this to the New York Times but don't actually give them the paper, and he  said that's not leaking.  Your reaction.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, it's -- yes, it begs a lot of questions.  And in someone  who believes it's so important that we are restoring trust, that we're  restoring the rule of law in this country, the FBI is the highest law  enforcement agency.  This is -- the people within the FBI must be held to  the highest standards, and that is what causes me so much dismay right now  is just the cloud that is over the FBI, and the questions that it has  raised.  We need the men and women there to act in the utmost authority, as  well as transparency and accountability to the American people.  And so,  yes, he clearly leaked, and it raises a lot of questions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is there going to be any accountability here,  Congresswoman?  I mean, look, last weekend, I had your colleague,  Congressman Devin Nunes on my Sunday morning program and he said, after  looking at all the electronic communications, he realized that there was no  intelligence used to actually launch an investigation into the Trump  campaign.  So, what happens now?  I mean, can we just keep seeing, you  know, people at the top of these important agencies abuse their power with  no accountability?</p><p>RODGERS:  No one is above the law and they must be held accountable.  And  that's the role of Congress, that's the role of the elected representatives  of the people within the House to make sure that we are taking action to  hold them accountable.  So, both in the Intelligence Committee as well as  the government oversight and reform committee which Trey Gowdy is the  chairman of, that's where these questions are asked and that's where  there's been frustration, that documents have not been turned over, that  people have not been as forthright in answering the questions, but it is up  to us to make sure that people are held accountable and that no one is  above the law. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, we'll be watching what develops then.  Then  there is this, the breaking news this breaking news this morning,  Congresswoman, and that is Dr. Ronny Jackson withdrawing his name for  consideration for the head of the V.A., President Trump's pick to lead the  Department of Veterans Affairs pulled his nomination in the last hour amid  all of these questions surrounding his professional conduct.   Congresswoman, your reaction to this news?</p><p>RODGERS:  I respect his decision.  It's most important that we get someone  at the V.A.  Again, we need to restore trust between the veterans and this  agency whose mission is to serve our veterans.  And as someone who  represents nearly 70,000 veterans in eastern Washington, I hear regularly  from veterans who feel like when they contact the V.A. that they're more of  a burden than actually having the red carpet rolled out for them.  So, we  need someone to head up the V.A., we need to get focused on the mission of  the V.A., and make sure that our veterans, those who have served are  getting the care that they need when the time comes, that has to be a top  priority for us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean, can we just ignore all of the barriers and the  booby traps that the left is putting in place for the Trump administration?   I mean, look at all of the positions that are yet unfilled.  Look at all of  the slow walking going on in terms of getting his nominees passed.  You  know, Mike Pompeo got -- you know, got support, but it was close.  I mean,  what about that, who is doing this?  We know that three administrations  have said how great Dr. Ronny Jackson is and all of a sudden, somebody  leaks all of this speculation about his personal life.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, that is -- yes, that's tough to see, and I respect his  decision just to pull out.  I am concerned that the left is putting  politics ahead of what's best for the country, and there's so many --  there's the V.A. position, Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, he's an  honorable man, a well-respected leader, he's proven himself, and yet too  many were willing to put politics ahead of what was best for the country.   We do need to get these people in place because that is part of making sure  that President Trump has the people around him to actually lead, and people  equal policy and he needs these people in place so that we can keep moving  forward.  There's a lot on our plate right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think people are figuring this out, that there's -- all of  these booby traps that are being put in by the skeptics and critics of  President Trump.  And then there's China, of course, reportedly threatening  to \"fierce counterstrike\" if the President goes ahead with these another  $100 billion in tariffs as punishment for the alleged intellectual property  theft.  Congressman, your thoughts on this.  I know Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary and a whole delegation are going next week to meet with  their counterparts in China to talk this out.</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, there's too many examples of illegal practices by  China, where we have seen them taking our intellectual property and  duplicating it.  I have examples in Eastern Washington, Washington State,  and it destroys companies here in America.  I am encouraged that President  Trump is focused on making sure that we hold China accountable.  I have had  concerns about the across-the-board approach to tariffs that, you know, he  was talking about imposing upon steel and aluminum.  I do believe it needs  to be more targeted but we must hold a country like China accountable for  illegal practices or free and fair trade will never work. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bottom line, do you think that the President with his tough  talk and the team is going to be able to account that budget deficit with  China, which is already now up to 375 billion?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, if anyone can do it, I believe it's President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes,</p><p>RODGERS:  And he is focused on this.  I had the chance to spend some time  with Larry Kudlow just last week.  I'm really pleased to see him as the  head of the economic advisors, his chief economic adviser.  He understands  economics, world trade, and also what's going on in China.  And he  basically told us everything is on the table, tariffs, no tariffs,  sanctions, but we must hold them accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's going to be on that trip as well, Larry Kudlow, and  Peter Navarro.  What about this budget about face, Congresswoman?   President Trump is now urging lawmakers to rescind some of the spending of  that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill which he signed last month.   Congresswoman, are there enough votes to make it happen and obviously you  must be getting just as much pushback as so many others are, for signing  that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill with all the spending?</p><p>RODGERS:  Right.  Well, we must address the spending in this country.  It  is the number one threat that faces us, both from a military perspective as  well as economic perspective, we needed to get a budget in place, but it  spends too much, and that's where I am -- I'm actually encouraged that the  President, Mick Mulvaney is leading on putting together a rescission  package.  </p><p>We should have been doing this all along, really taking a look at those  opportunities to go into programs, go into agencies and actually through  the House and the Senate, cut the spending.  The budget process is broken,  the House passed all 12 of our appropriations bills.  We went through  program by program, agency by agency, the Senate did zero.  So, this has  been very frustrating.  </p><p>This is our fundamental job as the elected representatives, this is where  we exercise the power of the purse, and yet this process is broken.  So, I  am -- I definitely want to look at what the President -- what they can  propose.  I think the House and Senate should also be using this tool of  rescissions to take action that we can to reduce those deficits and reduce  the debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his three-day  state visit with an address to the joint meeting of Congress.  How was it,  what was your takeaway?  He was critical of the President's planned  withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, I think, it is important that these conversations continue.   I've never been a supporter of the Iran deal.  I thought it was bad deal.   It did not hold Iran accountable for not developing or obtaining nuclear  weapons.  And that's where we need our European allies to join us in making  sure that we have a deal that is going to accomplish the goal of ensuring  that they do not develop nuclear weapons.  And right now, we do not have  that confidence. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, real quick, who are you supporting for Speaker of  the House?</p><p>RODGERS:  Well, you know, I -- we need to make sure that we are voting on a  Republican speaker after the elections, so we need to stay focused on the  policy and on our midterms and making sure that we're getting that done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Thanks so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ford Motor now pulling all but two of its  passenger cars from its North American line up as part of a plan to save  money and make the company more competitive.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  Stu, a car company canceling all of its  cars?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Well, you know, if you can't make money  selling cars, I guess you forget about selling cars, and you go to light  trucks and SUVs because that's where the money is.  It's a perfectly  rational move but boy, does it come as a shock.  You know, when I think of  the Ford Motor company, I think of the Taurus, one of the best-selling  marks for almost a generation.  It's gone.  They're not going to sell that  thing in North America any longer.  The Fiesta is going.  A couple of other  marks, I guess you'd call them, are going.  I was just shocked to hear  that.  It's a car company, but it's not a car company.  It's now a light  truck and SUV company because it wants to make some more money.  Look at  the stock, up 2-1/2 percent, just because its walking away from the car  market.  I wondered if General Motors will do something similar or FiatChrysler, walk away from unprofitable lines because you got to make money  in this environment and that's what you got to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really fascinating.</p><p>VARNEY:  I find it fascinating, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is -- it is fascinating.  And remember the last CEO wanted  to make it a mobility company.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  My, how times change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  I know you'll have a  lot more on it.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Sure, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart.  It is the busiest day of  the earnings season today, G.M. one of the big names out this morning.   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the  numbers.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The busiest day  of 68 S&amp;P 500 companies, and to your point, your chat with Stuart, guess  what, G.M. is doing much of the same, focusing on a highly-profitable  pickup trucks, and that's what's costing them going forward for 2018.  So,  for the quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line.  Profit was on  the rise, and it's the high-margin vehicles that they're going to be  working on.  So, 2018, they expect that they will have flat profits but  expect the all new pickup trucks would boost the margins in 2019.  The  stock is down a half of one percent.  </p><p>Then, let's take a look at Starbucks.  So, we're expecting for Starbucks to  report after the bell today.  Global same-store sales are likely on the  rise to the tune of about 1.8 percent.  They still, obviously or have the  P.R. that they have to deal with from Philadelphia, removing those two  black men, but big spot is China.  That's where they see the growth.  In  fact, they're opening one new store in China every 15 hours.  And also, you  can get cold foam on your new -- on your new Starbucks.  All right, Dagen,  back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  So, coming up, it's not your average  day.  We are celebrating National Pretzel Day.  Maria's pretzel with a  small business is growing fast.  We take you live to plaza, where there is  a pretzel truck waiting.  I've already eaten one, they're delicious.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you outside on the plaza,  outside headquarters.  What a twist in this National Pretzel Day.  We are  celebrating in style with a small business that is growing fast.  Joining  me right now is Dan Dizio, he's the CEO and co-founder of Philly Pretzel  Factory and we've got the team here ready to munch on all pretzels.  Dan,  great to see you.  </p><p>DAN DIZIO, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY:  Me, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, and I love the MORNINGS WITH  MARIA in pretzel.  That is very cool, nice touch.  You've been selling  pretzels since you're 11 on the corner in Philadelphia.  Tell us how you  started your business.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, my next door neighbor had a pretzel bakery, got stuck with a  bunch of pretzels.  I'm 47 now.  This week, I'll be 47.  And he got stuck.   A woman asked if I would sell them on the shoe corner and we would split  the money.  And my mom said it would be OK.  He had to ask my mom  permission, and, for some reasons, my mom said it would be OK to stand on  the street corner all day (INAUDIBLE) but she said it was a different time  back then.  So -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  And, yes, I did it, and did real well, and the next thing I know  every guy was selling pretzels, and did all through middle school and high  school.  And I went to college and was a graduate, and had a stockbroker  job and just didn't like the 9:00 to 5:00 thing, and I want to get back to  the pretzel business and I talked my college roommate into doing a pretzel  business and that's how it started, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You started with the food truck, the Philly Pretzel Factory,  you've got the food truck -- Hi, everybody.  Did you have a pretzel?  Tell  me about the food truck business because this is a really successful way to  sell.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we've had the truck for a few years now.  We're really doing  well with the weddings, bar mitzvahs, just different event.  I mean,  there's different places we could take it, so it'd be mobile.  That's the  way you have to be in this moment right now as for -- be able to  (INAUDIBLE) and be able to bring the pretzel to the people where they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, you have 170 locations across the country.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're opening more stores.</p><p>DIZIO:  Yes, we're actually opening up 25 in New York right now.  We just  did area development deal to open up 25 in Manhattan over the next few  years.  So, we're excited about that.  And we have about 42 stores under  development.  So, we're really excited.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  How long does it take to actually bake a pretzel?</p><p>DIZIO:  It takes about seven minutes to bake a pretzel.  Yes, yes.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  Some of these.  OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  And some sausage, am I right?</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm digging it.</p><p>DIZIO:  They're hotdogs.  (INAUDIBLE) This is a new product we had.  It's  our mini hotdog trade.  We've done really well over the years with hotdog  pretzels.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a mini-hotdog stand.  I like that.</p><p>DIZIO:  And we do many hotdogs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fit for a party. </p><p>DIZIO:  That's exactly what it's meant for.  Tailgating parties.  It's been  a big hit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the Republican tax plan, did that impact you as a small  business?</p><p>DIZIO:  It actually did.  I mean, more money for the small businesses.   Remember, our franchisees are business owners and there are small  businesses in communities, and to be able to have a tax break for them,  really lets them reinvest, maybe open another location up, reinvest.  I  mean, these are part of the community, these franchise locations.  I mean,  they sponsored the little league.  They have more money to do these things  and it really does have that effect to help everything in their  communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p>DIZIO:  It's -- we're doing a lot in Midwest, a lot down south.  I mean,  Philadelphia has been haven for pretzels and it is where it all started.   So, we're stretching out, we're in 19 states now and it continues to grow  and people are fascinated and falling in love with the (INAUDIBLE) once we  had --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  These are so good, Maria.  We have to get involved.  These are so  good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan Dizio, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DIZIO:  Thank you.  It's great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wait, can I have the (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  These are just out of the oven.  Stuart Varney,  over to you.  Do you want to have pretzels?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Delivery, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll have it set up for you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take it away, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Trump called on tech firms to 'develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike,' and also blasted violent video games and elements of the culture at large. </p><p>A series of shooters, including the El Paso suspect, have used the Internet to broadcast warped manifestos before carrying out their deeds. </p><p>Trump this week tore into search giant Google and its CEO Tuesday, touting claims that it worked to undermine his 2016 election and saying he was watching the company 'very closely.'</p><p>Trump issued the warning to the tech behemoth amid a legislative push to regulate big tech, and his own repeated claims that forces are arrayed against him in the elections. </p><p>He claimed its boss, CEO Sundar Pichai, had groveled to him on how well the administration was performing.</p><p>The attack on Google came a day after he blamed social media as one of the reasons for mass shootings, in a speech which also took aim at online forums and the internet as causing a 'culture of violence.'</p><p>Trump began his Twitter blasts at the company by claiming its chief executive officer had sought to flatter him, in a likely reference to a meeting held last month at the White House with Pichai and other tech executives. </p><p>'@sundarpichai of Google was in the Oval Office working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China's military, that they didn't help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election, and that they...are NOT planning to illegally subvert the 2020 Election despite all that has been said to the contrary,' Trump tweeted. </p><p>'It all sounded good until I watched Kevin Cernekee, a Google engineer, say terrible things about what they did in 2016 and that they want to 'Make sure that Trump losses [sic]...in 2020,' Trump continued.</p><p>He was referencing a segment on Lou Dobbs' Fox Business Network, which was broadcast Monday, where Cernekee promoted the theory that Google suppressed positive search results on Trump and promoted negative news about him.</p><p>He also touted an appearance by 'Clinton cash' author Peter Schweizer.</p><p>'@peterschweizer stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on Hillary Clinton, and boosted negative stories on Donald Ttump [sic]. All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!' Trump wrote. The tweet included a typo when it referenced Trump's name. </p><p>Cernekee, a former Google engineer, told Dobbs on Monday: 'When President Trump won in 2016, Google executives went up on stage right away and cried, literally tears streaming down their faces over the fact that President Trump won. </p><p>'They vowed that it would never happen again, and they want to use all of the power and all the resources that they have to control the flow of information to the public and make sure that Trump loses in 2020.'</p><p>Cernekee was fired from Google in 2018. He claims he was subjected to 'bullying' due to his conservative political posture. Google denies his claim.</p><p>Hours earlier, Trump had tweeted out a clip of Schweizer telling Dobbs about Google: 'They suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and they boosted negative stories about Donald Trump.' </p><p>Schweizer also said that in 2016 Google didn't feel like it had to 'tip the scale all that much' and predicted the firm would go 'all-in' in 2020.</p><p>Last year, Trump issued a similar threat, and claimed the firm's search results were 'RIGGED.' </p><p>Google issued a statement denying the charge in 2018, which online search experts also have said is untrue. </p><p>'Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology,' it said.</p><p>'Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. </p><p>'We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.' </p><p>The election result did cause upset inside Google. During a company meeting immediately after the election, several execs said they had backed Hillary Clinton but sought to reassure employees. </p><p>Said co-founder Sergey Brin at the meeting: 'Myself as an immigrant and a refugee, I certainly find the selection deeply offensive and I know many of you do too ... I think it's a very stressful time and conflicts with many of our values.'</p><p>Tensions between Silicon Valley and Trump and the Republican party over what the right claims is anti-conservative bias on Google and social media platforms have been growing.</p><p>One pro-Trump senator has brought forward draft legislation which would limit social media companies' ability to produce 'endless scrolls.'</p><p>And Republican members of Congress have repeatedly questioned executives on allegations of bias.</p><p>They have asked whether Google News results are rigged in favor of liberal outlets, and whether Twitter in particular has selectively censored conservative views.</p><p>Trump himself has railed against Twitter, claiming it has made it difficult for users to follow him, although the platform denies that is the case. </p><p>In July Trump publicly endorsed a claim by controversial Paypal founder Peter Thiel that Google was working with the Chinese military rather than the U.S. military, which Thiel called 'seemingly treasonous.'</p><p>But Trump's Treasruy Secretary Steven Mnuchin walked back that claim, which was made at a conservative conference.</p><p>Mnuchin told CNBC: 'We're not aware of any areas where Google is working with the Chinese government that in any way raises concerns.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-55087357</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS1-1XF1-JCJY-G2GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1262\"/><timeReceived>10:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Paul Gosar lashed out on Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The impeachment hoax makes one thing clear: Democrats will never accept the outcome of the 2016 election,  Gosar <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RepGosar/status/1202602280543014914\"> wrote </url>.  I stand with @realDonaldTrump! </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sentiment was typical of Gosar and indeed of most Republican lawmakers as impeachment proceedings drive partisanship on Capitol Hill to new heights.</p><p>All that bad blood appears increasingly irrelevant, however, when it comes to sticking it to Silicon Valley.</p><p>At the same time Gosar was fuming over impeachment, he was quietly applauding Pelosi s new effort to strip the tech industry s legal-liability protections from the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. </p><p> It s never too late to do the right thing,  Gosar said in a statement.  Permanently codifying Big Tech's immunity under CDA 230 in the USMCA will constrain Congress' ability to modify the law in the future. When it comes to free speech, free markets, and free elections the stakes are simply too high to cut corners. I urge this particular provision s removal from the USMCA and other future trade agreements. </p><p>Gosar isn t the only Trump ally making common cause with Pelosi. </p><p> I agree with Speaker Pelosi that they should strip the provision from the deal,  said Sen. Ted Cruz.  I sent a letter earlier to [U.S. Trade Representative Robert] Lighthizer urging him to delete the provision, and I m very glad Speaker Pelosi is urging him to do the same thing.\"</p><p> It is completely irrelevant to the substance of the USMCA,  Cruz later told reporters.  It was nothing but a giant gift to big tech that was airdropped into the text of the agreement. </p><p>The growing debate over tech regulations on Capitol Hill has already produced an unusual level of bipartisanship.

The language, modeled off of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, prevents online platforms from being sued for content posted by their users. </p><p>Concerned about the proliferation of hateful, violent, and illegal content online and in some cases, worried about the perceived liberal bias of Silicon Valley lawmakers have spent well over a year mulling serious changes to Section 230. </p><p>Given the ongoing debate, leadership in both parties now agree that adding similar liability language to future trade agreements is unacceptable. And they haven t been shy in making their displeasure known.</p><p> I am troubled that the U.S. Trade Rep has continued to insert this ... at a time when Republicans and Democrats are raising serious questions about how Section 230 has been interpreted by the courts,  said House Energy and Commerce ranking member Greg Walden.</p><p>In August, Walden joined Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone in a letter <url normalizedValue=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/pallone-and-walden-urge-lighthizer-not-to-include-section-230-in-trade\"> urging </url> Lighthizer not to include similar language in future trade agreements. </p><p>Walden was frustrated when the language was nevertheless included in an agreement with Japan and even more frustrated now that, months later, he finds himself still waiting on a response from Lighthizer. </p><p> I m talking directly to the White House about it now,  Walden said.</p><p>As a supporter of the USMCA more broadly, Walden wouldn t go as far as some of his fellow Republicans in supporting Pelosi s effort. </p><p> I don t want to upend USMCA,  he said.  I respect Speaker Pelosi weighing in I get that and there are a lot of us frustrated. But the best we can do on USMCA is get the changes that have been negotiated done and voted. </p><p>That puts Walden in opposition with Pallone, his erstwhile ally on the issue, who enthusiastically endorsed Pelosi s effort on Thursday.</p><p> I think they should take the language out,  Pallone told reporters.  I ve said it repeatedly. </p><p>Even Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, an occasional ally of the tech industry and a rare congressional supporter of Section 230, said he d defer to Pelosi.</p><p> We need to protect Section 230 for the United States, but we shouldn t be imposing it on other countries,  Khanna said.</p><p>The burgeoning bipartisan opposition to the export of Section 230 and the increasing skepticism of the provision s impact inside the United States has surprised some experts.</p><p> The consensus regarding [tech] firms as non-publishers has dissipated so rapidly, it s shocking,  said Susan Aaronson, director of the Digital Trade and Data Governance Hub at George Washington University.</p><p>Experts in international trade say Pelosi s effort to remove tech s legal shield from the USMCA shouldn t be a huge logistical challenge. Though Mexico has already signed the agreement, they say any changes can be resolved through side letters or amendments. </p><p>But those experts also say Walden s fear is likely justified that a successful attempt to remove Section 230 language will make it much tougher for the USMCA to pass the House. </p><p> It s not just a nail it s a spike in the coffin of the USMCA,  said Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Treasury official.  As I see it, the platforms would lobby very heavily against the USMCA if this was ripped out. </p><p>While tech lobbyists seemed momentarily stunned by news of Pelosi s effort, by Thursday afternoon they had begun to coordinate a response.</p><p> Failing to include intermediary liability protections which have been a part of U.S. law for two decades in USMCA would negatively impact the countless small businesses and entrepreneurs that use online platforms to export and advertise their businesses,  Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement.</p><p>Despite their diminished political clout, Hufbauer expects the tech platforms will fight tooth-and-nail to keep the language in the agreement.</p><p> They would see this as the camel s nose in the door for opening up legal liability in the U.S., in Europe, and elsewhere,  he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-703093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNS-S751-JBNW-33G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Trump's attack against the Alphabet Incunit follows a string of grievances against technology companies, including social media Twitter Incand Facebook Inc , which he has accused of silencing conservative voices, and Amazon.com Inc , which he has said is hurting small businesses and benefiting from a favourable deal with the U.S. Postal Services. He frequently berates news outlets for what he perceives as unfair coverage. Googledenied any political bias, saying in a statement that its search engine is \"not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results towards any political ideology.\" </p><p>Trump said in several tweets on Tuesday that Googlesearch results for \"Trump News\" were \"rigged\" against him because they showed only coverage from outlets like CNN and not conservative publications, suggesting the practice was illegal. \"I think Googleis really taking advantage of our people,\" Trump said on Tuesday in the Oval Office. \"Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful. It's not fair to large portions of the population.\" Facebookdeclined to comment. Twitter did not comment when asked for a response. In congressional testimony, both companies have denied engaging in partisan censorship. Neither Trump nor the White House detailed how or under what legal justification they would use to probe Google. Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later told reporters that the White House was \"taking a look\" at Google, saying the administration would do \"some investigation and some analysis,\" without providing further details. Earlier this summer, the new Republican chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. In a previous investigation, the FTC decided that Googlewas likely justified in developing a search function that harmed other companies. Congressional sources cautioned that it may be difficult for Trump to find a way to probe Googleabout news search results, and that Congress is unlikely to pass any applicable laws. The Federal Communications Commission ceded jurisdiction over regulating online communications when it repealed its net neutrality rules. U.S. member of Congress<person><nameText>Ted Lieu, </nameText></person>a Democrat, said in a tweet directed at Trump that such restrictions on Googlewould violate the U.S. Constitution: \"If government tried to dictate the free speech algorithms of private companies, courts would strike it down in a nanosecond.\" Shares of Alphabet fell 0.8 percent to US$1,245.86. TRUMP'S CRITICISM OF MEDIA While the exact science behind Googlesearches on the internet is kept secret, its basic principles are widely known to be generated with a variety of factors measured by the company's algorithms. The factors Googleuses to determine which websites appear first in search results include how often that page is linked to on other sites, the use of keywords, the popularity and respectability of the news site, and personal browsing history of the person conducting the search. Highly trafficked and cited websites like CNN.com and NYTimes.com, two of the most Trump's most frequent targets, often appear first in search results. Trump's accusation of bias on the part of Googlecomes as social media companies have suspended accounts, banned certain users and removed content as they face pressure from the U.S. Congress to police foreign propaganda and fake accounts aimed at disrupting American politics, including operations tied to Iran and Russia. Companies such as Facebookand Twitter have also been pressed to remove conspiracy driven content and hate speech. Tech companies have said they do not remove content for political reasons. Some Republican U.S. lawmakers have also raised concerns about social media companies removing content from some conservatives, and have called Twitter's chief executive to testify before a House of Representatives panel on Sept. 5. Earlier this month, Alphabet's YouTube joined Apple Inc and Facebookin removing some content from Infowars, a website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones was also temporarily suspended on Twitter.

And today I'm signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule: Hire American. We've been doing it at a level that hasn't been done maybe ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'll also be taking firm, disciplinary action against the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has sadly and cruelly betrayed American workers. And we have some of those great American workers with us at the table. This is the Cabinet Room, and it's an honor to have you in the Cabinet Room and at the Oval Office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're joined by the Vice President; Congressman Tim Burchett, who's doing a fantastic job in the state of Tennessee; Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia; Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Secretary, Ken Cuccinelli. Where's Ken? Hi, Ken. I didn't see you down there. That's great. Doing a great job.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Quiet, as usual.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Keep you busy, right? (Laughter.) We're keeping you busy, Ken.</p><p>Recently, the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeffrey Lyash, made a disastrous and heartless decision. The TVA announced that it would lay off over 200 American workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers brought in from overseas.</p><p>The Tennessee Valley Authority leadership then ordered the American workers to train their foreign replacements, rubbing salt in their very open wound.</p><p>So we're going to bring in workers. They're going to foreign workers. And people from Tennessee, and some others states right around it, are going to train them -- what to do and how to do it. It doesn't work that way.</p><p>As we speak, we're finalizing H1-B regulations so that no American worker is replaced ever again. H1-Bs should be used for top, highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor program to destroy American jobs.</p><p>Sitting at the table are six of the TVA workers who were ordered to train the foreign labor flown in to replace them. I want you and your colleagues to know that my administration will not be putting up with -- I happen to know a young woman who's been very active over the last couple of years because we were together on Disney and a couple of other things.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it all seems to be working out pretty well.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And thank you for it.</p><p>But that's why I'm formally removing the chairman of the board, James Thompson, and board member Richard Howorth. If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers, then more board members will be removed. We have the absolute right to remove board members. And the board makes the decision; I don't make the decision. I saw there was an ad on television talking about the amount of money that the chairman makes, and it's a ridiculous amount of money. But we have the right to replace the board, and the board is the one -- the only ones that get the right to then hire a new person.</p><p>Furthermore, the board must immediately hire that new CEO who puts the interest of American workers first. The current CEO, Jeff Lyash, is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year. Did you know that? Eight million. He's the highest-paid government official of any country anywhere in the world.</p><p>Now, I don't know that you call him officially a \"government.\" It might be a public-private. It may be something -- a lot time ago, it was established, Tennessee Valley Authority. But he gets $8 million a year. So that was just a succession of deep-swamp things happening, and it's a disgrace. But he gets $8 million a year, and I can think of about almost 100 percent of the people I know would take that job. (Laughter.) It's not a very hard job. I mean, you have not a lot of debt, not a lot of anything, right?</p><p>Public service is just that: Those who takes these jobs must be focused on the public good, not on personal profit. He would have taken the job for millions and millions of dollars less, but nobody asked him to do that. Okay? He would have gone for less. You could have had him for $4 million, $6 million, $7 million, $2 million, $1 million, probably $500,000 a year.</p><p>But the new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year, which is still a significant amount more than the President of the United States makes. And I donate my salary. I've donated it. From what I hear, I'm the only President to do that. You'll have to check on that, but that's what I've heard. I'm very surprised to hear that. But I donate my full salary; I don't take it.</p><p>The board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure, too. We don't want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars.</p><p>We want the TVA to take action on this immediately: Lower energy prices in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. I love all those states. Any additional states you can think of there? I don't know. Let's see. So we're talking about of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Great states, there -- every one of them.</p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words: \"You're fired.\" \"You're fired.\" It's ridiculous. The man is getting $8 million. It'd be interesting to see how much money he made before this. And I have no idea. Maybe he made more. I don't know. But I doubt it. But it'd be interesting to see. He got this position -- must have been politically inspired because I can think of probably, almost, everybody in the nation would have liked this position, including every one of the media folks across the table from me. I would say that everybody would have liked this position.</p><p>So, with that, we're getting rid of him in one form or another. Either the board is going to do it, we're going to do it. But he's gone. And he's done not a great job. He's done not even a good job, in certain ways. Plants in Kentucky -- he could've kept the plant open in Kentucky, if he wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant. And he didn't do that, did he, Congressman?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't do that.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We asked him to do it. He didn't want to do it. We said, \"That's okay.\" And here we are doing what we're doing today.</p><p>So we will get somebody for a much lower price. I want the saving -- much lower salary -- I want the saving to go to the people of these great states in the form of energy savings. And that's a pretty substantial number.</p><p>So, Kevin, could I ask you to start off and say a few words, please?</p><p>MR. LYNN: I certainly appreciate that, Mr. President. My name is Kevin Lynn. I'm the executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform and the founder of U.S. Tech Workers. And thank you for paying attention to our ad, Mr. President.</p><p>We were founded -- we founded U.S. Tech Workers three years ago to look at the -- and inform the public on the great harm that's being caused by the outsourcing and offshoring of our skilled labor jobs. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for inviting us here. On behalf of U.S. Tech Workers and the Tennessee Valley Authority, we appreciate your willingness to look at the endangered jobs of the Tennessee Valley Authority workers, especially in a time of pandemic and an election year, when you've been so busy signing documents that affect the welfare of millions of Americans.</p><p>Taking time to ensure that these hundreds of workers, under your administration, can continue to provide great services to the American people, as they have since 1933, shows the people of Tennessee and beyond that you stand by your promise to keep American jobs with Americans.</p><p>This is a historic moment that I'm hopeful will reverse the harm outsourcing and offshoring have done to our nation's productive classes. And it is my hope that Congress will join you, Mr. President, in making sure our workers are more secure in their jobs.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. LYNN: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're the one that took the ad about me that -- I didn't know that. (Laughter.) I was just saying, you know, \"I think he's the one that took this, really, vicious ad.\" Like, I hired this guy for $8 million, that I had nothing to do with it. I said, \"What's that?\" But, actually, you brought something very important up, because when I looked into it, I said, \"This guy is actually making $8 million a year.\" And you did the ad. So you really made me aware of what was going on with the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has been a -- a feeding pot for a long time. And a lot of deep state, a lot of swamp creatures, okay?</p><p>So, that's it. So we're going to make that -- I see. So I think now you realize that it wasn't about me. I hope you now realize that.</p><p>MR. LYNN: I do realize that, Mr. President. (Laughter.) But if I could --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I accept -- I accept your apology. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: In full disclosure, Mr. President, when we sat down with the Davis Agency constructing the ad, they said, \"Who's your audience?\" And I said, \"Just one person. He's the only one that...\" --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's smart. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: -- \"...would do this, and he's the only one that can come to the aid of these workers in the Tennessee Valley.\"</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He's the only one with any guts to do it -- who has guts to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll tell you, though -- I have to say, Kevin, the end was very appropriate. And while it has nothing to do with me, I can do things with respect to the board, and ultimately, the board controls that decision. This is a very, very old authority done in the --</p><p>MR. LYNN: 1933, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So it was done during the FDR days. And it's been -- you know, it's been getting crazier and crazier just over the years. And they have, basically, nobody watching over them. And the board isn't watching. You see this happening in public companies also. You see it happening a lot.</p><p>But for a essentially -- I would say, for a federal employee to be paid $8 million -- now what we're doing is we're looking at the board members, how much are they paid. Because usually what happens is they pay, and then he says, \"You know, I think you ought to get more money.\" And everybody is making a lot of money, and your pricing for electric and utilities starts going up, and people say, \"I wonder why.\"</p><p>I also see that they're doing a lot of things in terms of electric, which is very expensive electric. They're building facilities that are very, very expensive to build and don't work well. But we'll discuss that separately.</p><p>But I appreciate it because you did make me aware of what's going on, and it's a terrific thing we're doing today. Thank you very much, Kevin.</p><p>Please, Stacy. How are you?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: I'm doing fine. Mr. President, my name is Stacy Whetzell. I'm the son of a sharecropper.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for being the great American President you are and for caring about and looking out for the great American citizens and workers. We thank you for that.</p><p>I picked cotton from the time I was big enough to carry my own pick sack until I married. My wife and I have been married 47 years and have 7 children and 14 grandchildren. I began working for TVA in 1975 as a carpenter's apprentice. Currently, I'm the system administrator on TVA's core team that's responsible for installing a $20 million computer system. Our team and the entire IT department have been praised and thanked multiple times this summer for the outstanding performance we've done.</p><p>So it was shocking and devastating to be notified on July the 23rd that IT leadership had decided our team and a total of 40 workers would be terminated and our work done to others. This brings the total planned outsourced jobs to over 200 in TVA information technology alone. We believe there are more planned to come.</p><p>The three companies chosen to do the IT work are all three foreign companies that depend heavily on H1-B workers. We're required to train these -- our replacements, as President Trump said. Apparently, we're good enough to train but not retain.</p><p>Using H1-B workers to replace capable and willing American citizens is turning entire American communities upside down. Left unchecked, it will turn our nation upside down and negatively impact our national security as certainly as our 50-year build-up of dependence on China for manufacturing has. Thank you, President Trump, for beginning to reverse that hive-centric mistake.</p><p>American patriots will forever be grateful that you're also acting and fought the misguided and out-of-control H1-B worker program. I thank you for Americans first and acting to stop this travesty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you're a very powerful speaker. And so powerful that we just got a call -- Mark just brought this in from -- the TVA CEO, and he's indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course. (Laughter and applause.)</p><p>So it must have been Stacy. I think Stacy did a much better job than me. I mean, you're talking and all of the sudden, I get the note.</p><p>So he's looking to change course and reverse it, and that's good. Now, maybe he'll take a major cut in salary, too. That'll be phase two, right? So we'll take a look at that. And maybe you'll start looking at that on behalf of everybody, gratis. Right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your group. That's great, isn't it.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I mean, TVA told me while we were in this process of working on behalf of the workers -- I'm the union president, IFPTE-Engineering Association. They told me it's going to take a message -- a stop order from the President in order to keep us from moving forward. And I said, \"I'm working on that.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Everybody in this room did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: I appreciate you, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, Congressman, you have my endorsement.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You had it anyway, but you have it now. It's a great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Well, I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: The only congressman in the room. I tell you, Tim, great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, brother.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's only phase one. Phase two is -- imagine being paid the $8 million a year to run a thing that's pretty easy to run, in all fairness. It's not like he built it; he didn't build it. He went there and he's been there, and he gets a lot of money, and it shouldn't be. Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, right?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir. In Tennessee, it is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And I'm willing to say he gets paid more money than I do. I don't care.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But, you know, it shouldn't happen.</p><p>So that's a start. That's a start. And I think we should find out what board members make, okay? Because --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I'll look into that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- I can almost guarantee you they're paid heavily.</p><p>Congratulations, Stacy. Really good.</p><p>Please, go ahead.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir. Mr. President, thank you. My name is David Littlejohn. I am a soon-to-be father. This November, my wife will be giving birth to my first child. I am a long line -- I'm the son in a long line of military men and women, so I was born with a heart of service. And with that, I love to serve the people of the Valley.</p><p>I was told July 23rd that I would be sent home and to be trained -- training a contractor from a H1-B-dependent contract company. Now, I'm shaking right now because --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing great.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You had a big victory already. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>I'm shaking right now because this really impacts me and my wife and my unborn child, and I greatly appreciate everyone here to support us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate it, and thank you very much.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you'll see what happens. It's going to be very quick, too. Thank you.</p><p>Wendy, please.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah. I'm Wendy Turner, and thank you for having us here. I've been a software engineer at TVA for 19 years. I'm going to change my comments a little. I was (inaudible) saying, you know, for the first time in 19 years, I didn't know what was going to happen to me and my kids, and I also take care of my mom. But what we're going to do going forward -- so, thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And this was -- everybody felt this way in Tennessee Valley Authority then, I guess- right? -- if you do. You've been there for 19 years. So everyone had to feel this way, like there's been a big feeling of doubt, right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Right. Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's a terrible thing.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They're waiting for it to happen to them.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, and I've been training since June. I've been training our replacements from a company that relied on --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've been training people?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yes. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And so, did they let you off yet? Or are you not sure?</p><p>MS. TURNER: I got my notice in June that we would be laid off September 1st.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're training people to take your job at a -- whatever. Right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They told us it would be --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And where are the people from that you're training?</p><p>MS. TURNER: All over the place. We -- everything is done remotely or --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are they from other countries?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They're here on soil now. I don't know their status as far as --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Because with Disney, they were from other countries, right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, so I don't know. I know the com- -- Accenture is replacing our group, and I know they rely heavily on H1-B workers, but I don't know for sure where everyone is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, we'll make sure that things work out for the three of them because they're brave to be here, actually, Sara. So you'll check that out, right?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let's see that they get their jobs back --</p><p>MS. TURNER: Thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- because I hear you're great workers. I mean, I said I want people, but I also people that are really good workers -- that did a great job. Because, you know, people can be let go; should be able to -- if they're not doing a good job. I'm all for that. I think -- I'll bet you are.</p><p>But I said, \"I want people that really do a great job and were unfairly let go.\" Right, Tim?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's, to me, very important.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Wendy. We'll see what happens. Okay? We're going to push it hard.</p><p>Chuck, please.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I recognize how busy your schedule is, and I sincerely appreciate your time today. Okay?</p><p>I'm Chuck Charnawskas. Basically, I've had the opportunity to work with the really technically competent people of the Tennessee Valley for seven years, okay? It's been a great experience. I have a degree in electrical engineering, 45 years of valuable industrial experience, and I'm a certified security professional here, okay?</p><p>Working with the people in Tennessee Valley was how I learned just how important the Tennessee Valley is to 11 million people in seven different states, okay, and how it basically impacts their lives. It's absolutely significant. And that is the reason that I'm really here today.</p><p>The TVA basically has the capability to produce 35 billion watts of powers, okay? They have 17,000 lines of high-voltage transmission.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How does that compare to other big utilities, would you say?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: It definitely ranks right in the top of them. There's no question about it. And very significant: Tennessee Valley is part of the Southeastern Reliability Corporation, and it's obviously one of the biggest players in that area.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yea, it's very big. That's a lot.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Very significant in that respect, okay? And in essence here, as a consequence of that, they also basically support 35 dams -- that produce power from 29 -- to do flood control.</p><p>Just a couple years ago, they were able to reduce billions of dollars of potential damage by managing the rivers correctly, in that case.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: They have three major power plants -- nuclear power plants.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What's your biggest dam? What's the big dam?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Probably it would be Chickamauga or --</p><p>MR. HICKS: Wilson. Wilson Dam, in Alabama.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Wilson in Alabama.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: There's the expert, right down there. (Laughter.) So I defer to the expert about that.</p><p>But the bottom line of it: As a consequence of this, it's a very -- a very important player not only in the Southeast region, but for (inaudible) internationally, okay? And today, the TVA receives hundreds if not thousands of potential attacks -- cyberattacks -- testing its network here, right?</p><p>It's imperative to have experienced, knowledgeable employees to handle that situation, yeah. Okay?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And a fine example of this -- and I just kind of -- you know, it's a little bit humorous, but the great power outage in 2003 was affected by a software glitch -- okay? -- that impacted and it shut down Manhattan for 24 hours.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I remember that very well. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: I thought you might be related -- or familiar with that. So, as a -- it just really points to the significance of having qualified, vetted people with proper clearances.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: -- dedicated to that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree. That wouldn't happen with you, would it? Huh? It wouldn't happen.</p><p>MS. TURNER: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And then just a -- quickly, two other quick points. Basically, this outsourcing agreement could impact -- the Tennessee Valley has always -- our goals are to provide energy, economic development, and protect the environment. This particular outsourcing agreement could impact the Valley by $88 million to these local economies here. And for the individuals that are in there, not only may they lose their primary income, but they may consequently have insurance costs that basically reflect a 3- to 400 percent increase for these families on how they manage it.</p><p>And I'd like --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And you're going to lose -- you're going to lose people when you're firing people that are -- they live in Tennessee and they live in Georgia and they live in the other states that I mentioned, and it's not a fair situation.</p><p>Go ahead. Let's -- let's go, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Final point: The effort here to make America great again -- okay -- reflects the fact that we need to take into repatriate manufacturing companies and companies to take and spend our money domestically and support the domestic product. How can we justify spending these millions of dollars -- for one particular consulting firm, $15 million to --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Who is the consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, that would be Capgemini (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You spent $15 million a year on a consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, this was a --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We just found another nugget of gold. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Sara doesn't care about that one, but that's a -- (laughter) -- I care about. You spent $15 million to one consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: It's not -- it's not a consulting -- that's one of the companies that are picking up. And it's Capgemini, and that's $15 million that -- just for that one company.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How many are there -- how many are there like that?</p><p>MS. HENSON: There's Capgemini, CGI, Accenture, and Tech Systems at TVA --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And they're paying tremendous amount of money?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir. And our workers are more than capable.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very -- they're very political people. You know this is a very political group of people you just named?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Really? I just know that --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Not to me. Not to me, I don't care. (Laughter.) I don't care who they are, but they -- they are very political.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, I mean, and these people are more than capable of doing the job and have done it with excellence. And TVA says your matrix for your performance is above; it doesn't make sense. And what you're doing -- I cannot tell you how much it means to me. And for these workers it -- and I'm very emotional because TVA is a large racket. They do their thing, and nobody can touch them. And I believe today they've been touched.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a racket.</p><p>MS. HENSON: They've been touched. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, it's a racket. Well, we just found that out. (Laughter.) No, it's a racket.</p><p>I mean -- I mean, I understand it. The four firms that you just mentioned that are paid tens of millions of dollars, they're very political firms. You know, they may be good, but they're very political firms. And they do it for much less much -- much, much, much less. You could give them half. You could give them 10 percent, they'd probably do it for. Those are big numbers for a consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they're -- they're not the consulting firm; they're the ones actually going to take these people's jobs. That --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's worse.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, it is worse. So I mean --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim, go ahead, please.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Mr. President, thank you --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: -- and Vice President so much for this. My mama worked at TVA after the Second -- during the -- at the end of the Second World War, when dad came home from the Pacific and married her, and then she went into education. But, you know, working people are the backbone of this country. That's not cliche and you've --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: -- you've highlighted that so much with the trades and other things, and I'm very appreciative of the fact.</p><p>But I'll you what: Dadgummit, if TVA wants be Duke Electric, let them because Duke Electric, but they're not. And they -- they hide behind the government's skirt and they -- they use eminent domain, and their arrogance is beyond belief. You know, when they had the ash spill, people died, and then -- you know, and then they are just these poor country folks that are just pushing them off until they all die off, until those lawsuits go away. It's ridiculous.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, that's right. And, by the way, in Kentucky, when we wanted to have a plant open with a lot of jobs, they didn't even want to consider it.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No. No, they didn't. It's their arrogance. You're questioning them, and finally we have a President with the guts that understands business and government. And if TVA wants to be a government entity, they need to -- they need to declare it, and quit using -- they hide behind -- you know, they have their -- their --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think Joe Biden would do this?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Heck no.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't know you're alive.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He'd be -- no, he'd --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He doesn't know he's alive either. (Laughter.)</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He needs to get out of the bunker.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, can you imagine him sitting at this table right now? Wouldn't have a clue.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. So go ahead, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, I think you pretty much covered it, Mr. President. I'm just honored to be here. And I --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm honored that you're here. And you've done a fantastic job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: And I thank you for standing up for working Americans.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, well we're going to -- and we're going to get this finished too. So we'll get it finished, Sara.</p><p>Thank you very much, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Gene, please.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Mr. President, thank you for bringing this group together. And this this meeting has, I think, shown a very human impact on individual working --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Incredible.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: -- men and women of a practice that's actually pretty widespread.</p><p>And the way it's worked under our immigration laws for a while now is that a company that wants to bring in workers from overseas -- wants to use the H1-B program for high-skilled workers -- has to file an attestation with us at the Labor Department, saying American workers aren't going to lose their jobs when I bring in these H1-B workers. And they have to say it's not going to hurt their wages.</p><p>But what companies do is they bring workers in, and then they lease them out to another company. And so you've got one company bringing them in and then leasing them to TVA. And it's true, the company bringing them in -- their workers aren't being affected, but the TVA workers are.</p><p>And so I took a look at this, as your Labor Secretary, recently, and I said to my staff -- I said, \"Well, if the workers are going to the other company, why doesn't the other company, where they're actually going to be working and supervised, also file an application?\"</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. Right.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: \"And say, 'We're not going to affect U.S. workers either.'\" And I said to staff, \"Why can't we do that?\" They looked into it. And, Mr. President, today, you're going be signing an order --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: -- that requires that change.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: So, going forward, when those workers are going to another company, both companies are going to (inaudible) -- (applause) -- and that's a change we'll make. We'll do it together with the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>I just want to mention one other thing we're doing together. For more than 15 years, the Secretary of Labor has had the authority to initiate an investigation of abuse of H1-B program when he or she finds reasonable cause. That has never been done. That authority has never been used.</p><p>But again, we saw -- signed a memo of understanding on Friday with the Department of Homeland Security that'll change that too. They're going to now share information they have, which I can then use to bring cases when we're finding the program (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. You're going to find a lot. And thank you very much, Gene.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Thank you. And thank you for this order today.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Good work, Stacy. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right, Stacy? Right? I like that. You like that?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: We'll take it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Linda, please.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being with us today. The concern you show for American workers is greatly appreciated. And my mother made me promise to tell you that Alabama loves and appreciates your leadership. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I love Alabama.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, a promise that my mother made.</p><p>My name is Linda McDonald. I've lived in northeast Alabama my entire life. My goal was to work at TVA; that was my American Dream. After years of sacrifice and hard work, I achieved that goal. I've been working for TVA for seven years now. But -- so, and in that role, I got to see every day --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So that was like an ambition of yours to work someday for TVA?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Correct.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you finally got there?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I did.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, what's happening?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, June 30th, we were told that we would be outsourced to another company with --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: All right. Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, so, here I am, faced with --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you had to have these consulting firms making 10, 15 million dollars a year?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, I feel like my --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And the man that heads it making $8 million a year, right? (Laughter.)</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I feel like my American Dream was being stolen from me --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: -- and given to someone else. So I just think --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Is that the way you view it: \"given to somebody else\"?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: It is. It was taken from me, and --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a very interesting way --</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: -- it was then given to someone else.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- of viewing it, right?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, I thank you for listening to us, because it felt, for so long, like no one was even listening to us. So thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I've been hearing about it for a long time. When I was running, I met Sara, and we worked on the Disney situation --</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- but that was a long time ago. But -- and, you know, this has been happening for a while. So we're taking care of it.</p><p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Linda. We'll see what happens. You may be very pleasantly surprised. Okay?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I hope so.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>Jonathan, please.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, thank you for your time.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MR. HICKS: My name is Jonathan Hicks. I'm a -- I'm from a large family, and we've had three -- three members of our family who have served in the U.S. military. I grew up in Tennessee, around the Knoxville area, and started my career with TVA in 2001 as an IT intern. During -- as soon as I graduated, I got a fulltime job there, and I've been there for -- for 19 years. I've been --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And that was a big deal, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Working -- because there's a great prestige to that.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's true.</p><p>MR. HICKS: I've spent my time there working for river operations for the -- for their group, and helping them, you know, have programs -- mostly in-house solutions to be able to manage the river and the river systems.</p><p>I was told in June -- early June -- that I would be training replacements, that I would be receiving my work notice in September, and that the workers that I'd be training, there's been five or plus that I've been training for my one position, and at least four of those seem to be H1-B type workers.</p><p>I guess there's a concern with the kind of stuff that we do, at least for the river operations, and that they're generating a significant amount of power out of all the -- out of all the -- all of these dams. And, you know, is this something that -- that we want to turn over this knowledge, this ability to control these dams and -- you know, whether it be generation, whether it be floodgates -- and hand it over to corporations that aren't in the U.S., to workers that aren't necessarily in the U.S. doing this work?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are you there now? Are you --</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I -- I've been put on non-work status. I'm still employed and still getting a paycheck until September 1st, but I've been --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What happens on September 1st?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I've been relieved of my job duties, but September 1st is when I would lose --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you train people to take your job?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you've worked with people to take your job.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've taught them, like, almost everything you know, but plenty, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I -- I think there's a big --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Maybe not. Maybe you held back a couple of secrets. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I think there's a -- I think there's a big learning curve and there's -- for the knowledge that they do there for river operations, I think it takes several years of understanding the job in order to be able to do this.</p><p>The people that are taking over the job have never dealt with utilities, they've never dealt with power generation, they've never dealt with any kind of water management or hydrogenation. And so the -- to say that they're ready to go is a misstatement. So --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, let's see how out it works out, Jonathan. I think you're going to be in very good shape. Okay? I have a prediction.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>Please.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: It's -- I'm so honored to be here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Honored to have you.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: My name is Renae McKenzie, and I actually work for the Engineering Association as an advocate for these IT employees and for other white-collar workers. But I've worked really closely with the IT professionals at TVA, with all of this that has been going on.</p><p>I've had to witness the anguish of the different employees that are performing these knowledge transfers on the software and the applications that they actually custom built themselves.</p><p>But so many TVA employees have been there from the beginning of their careers. So to actually witness what's happening to them, being replaced by these non-Americans, is very difficult.</p><p>But I think one of the hardest things to witness is what TVA is actually doing to themselves. I mean, their mission is about bringing economic development to the Tennessee Valley. And to be taking that -- taking our economy and just giving it outside of the United States is just almost -- it's unbelievable because of what they stand for and what they were built for. To come out of economic --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you see them going outside of the United States, not just here. You see them go --</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Well, if you look at these companies, these companies are based outside of the United States. So -- so when they're getting their millions of dollars, I mean, it's going to France, it's really going to -- I think one of them is --</p><p>MS. HENSON: India.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: India, Canada.</p><p>PARTICIPANT: Ireland</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: And Ireland. So, yes, our dollars are going to them.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Unbelievable. And they get us in many other ways too, but we're stopping it, as you noticed. That's very interesting.</p><p>So you would say France, India, Ireland, Canada. Who else?</p><p>MS. HENSON: That's the main groups right there. Those (inaudible) countries.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Those are the main ones.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: A lot of them -- are a lot of the workers being outsourced --</p><p>MR. LYNN: All these firms: H1-B visa dependent. And 70 percent of H1-B visa workers in the United States come from one country: mainly, India.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: You know, Mr. President, I worry too about the national security. You know, we're during a pandemic, people are out of work, and our electric grid could be put in the hands of folks that, maybe, their loyalty isn't to this great country, and that bothers me.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You know, with TVA, more so than most companies. You're right -- you're talking about controlling all of that energy and power. It's -- you're right. You're right about that, Tim. That's a very good statement. Anything else?</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Just, it -- again, it's such an honor to be in your presence. (Laughs.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's my honor. It's my great honor. Do you know the man next to you is Ken Cuccinelli, a legend? (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Look, and I tend to be very quiet like him. Just saying.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's a legend in his own mind. (Laughter.)</p><p>Ken -- Ken has done a fantastic job on the border. Unbelievable job on the border. And you might just tell us for a couple of seconds while we have the -- the media here -- I'm sure they'll report it very accurately -- how well we're doing on the border and then maybe get on to make a statement, because I know you've been working with Gene and everybody very hard.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Yes. And Secretary Scalia really covered the partnership with -- between DHS and Department of Labor to solve this problem. You're solving it forcefully today for these folks. You're certainly putting the ball in motion to do that. And what we're -- our two agencies, at your direction from June, are going to do is solve this permanently so that we never have to see this happen again.</p><p>But, on the border, we're seeing success with your leadership with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The relationships you helped us forge last year, in 2019, are bearing fruit at the border during a very difficult time with the coronavirus and that taskforce, of course, led by the Vice President. And the ability since March to enforce the public health order there has changed the nature of our ability to protect the border.</p><p>There are still people getting away, more than we would like. But last year, they were running to us; this year, they're running from us, at the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's right.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a bit different. And over 80 percent of the folks that we're apprehending are being returned to Mexico in under two hours, which is astonishing. It's just an astonishing turn.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It used to take, in some cases, years. Years.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Right. Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's been incredible what's happened at the border. And I think the wall is helping you quite a bit, right? We have now about almost 271 miles of wall.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Everywhere that that new system is put in place, the Border Patrol agents are just universal in their praise for both their safety and the way it impedes illegal traffic -- not just people, but drugs, as well, and so forth. So it's extremely effective, and it's going up faster and faster and faster.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They had a human trafficker the other day saying that they used to go out and they're trafficking -- human traffic -- mostly women and children, but mostly women, and they'd bring them across the border, taped up and -- horrible.</p><p>And this guy was saying how they used to go up and they'd make a left turn. They'd make a right and then a left into the United States. He says, and now we just keep driving into this massive wall that nobody gets through. Nobody is getting through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And it's steel, concrete, and everything else. And lots of cameras all over it.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And drones on top of it. And people aren't getting through. But it's been an incredible, incredible success.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a real force multiplier for the Border Patrol and OFO.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And Mexico is helping us a lot. They have --</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: A lot better partnership.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- 27,000 soldiers.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: I remember how people complained about how you were pushing them so hard last year. But the partnership that's grown up with Mexico has been the best. We have really had, in decades, if not forever --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's what they say.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: -- in cooperating and securing the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They have a very good President who was just here two weeks ago.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: He was. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's really doing a good job. And we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding the border. And they don't play games. They don't play games. It's been pretty amazing. The numbers are way, way down. And we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally, and that's --</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: You got to come in legally. That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it.</p><p>Okay, please. Go ahead. You can finish up.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I appreciate you so much. I really do. As I said earlier, I'm the union president for the workers that are represented by this move that TVA has taken. I met earlier with Tim Burchett and he told me how disgusted he was with it. But that was earlier.</p><p>We've really tried to get our voice heard. We've been screaming, \"Hey! Hey! Help us out.\"</p><p>Finally, U.S. Tech Workers came out, kind of put a commercial together, and we're -- you know, that got your attention, and we appreciate it so much.</p><p>I've lived my whole life in the Tennessee Valley region, and my uncle was a -- worked at TVA during World War Two. He laid his job aside, and went and served and perished in that war. My mother told me TVA was a great place to work, and I -- I've worked there now 35 years.</p><p>This means a lot to the people of the Tennessee Valley region, more than you will ever know. I know that consulting companies looked at what to do with this IT work. They're now looking at what to do -- the same consulting companies are looking at what do with the transmission work. That transmission -- that grid has got to be protected at all cost. And we've got to. We cannot afford to let someone else, who may not have the loyalty to our nation, have the grid.</p><p>And I think that some of these workers here at this table, IT workers, that's one of the biggest they've said to me: There's a large chance that we would be breached. And we can't do that. And we tried to say all those things --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, with our people running it, a very small chance, from what I understand.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes. With the right people running it. right. But you can't give it to just anybody. And that's why these workers at TVA are so important. And I appreciate you and all that you are doing for us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are the people that you're representing, are they -- because you represent a big group of people -- are they all nervous, like the folks at the table?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Like Wendy?</p><p>MS. HENSON: They're going, \"Are we next, Gay? Is this what's coming next?\" And my answer is, \"Not on my watch, if we can help it.\"</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tell them no. Tell them no, they're not next.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You can tell them. I think we can say that. So thank you very much.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Thank you. I just think you bringing TVA back to their mission of service to the people of the Valley, service to people of the Valley and to this nation is -- is a pivotal moment for the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, right now, their mission is taking care of a lot of consultants and a lot of people and paying -- paying heads of this whole thing $8 million a year. And you'll find a lot of other things in there that are crazy.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, people over profit. And that's what you're doing here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What do the people of Tennessee think when they hear that the head of TVA -- which has been running for a long time -- and, in all fairness, not a very difficult thing; there are many people who can do it. What do they hear when they hear -- and they think of government, you know? It's sort of semi- -- I guess, you call it -- public-private. But there's not private, really, when you think of it. So, it's a board member.</p><p>What do they think when they hear that the head person is making $8 million a year? Which is, by the way, I said it before, the most highly paid person anywhere in any country if you call this government, which it sort of is. What do they think when they hear? Do they know he makes $8 million a year?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they do now after Kevin's commercial. (Laughter.) But they're pretty shocked. I mean -- in fact, they -- I think the workers even -- I think some of the workers at TVA have been shocked about that. It is a lot of money.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But people have known. I've known, actually, before the commercial because we were looking at it. We sent them notices a year ago and two years ago saying, \"We want some information.\" And, you know, people have known this. I just can't even imagine that somebody gets paid $8 million a year.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, the difference --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's the most sought-after job. It has to be the most sought-after job in any country in any government. Right, Tim? You'd take the job. Would you resign from Congress immediately?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Take it for one year. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You only need it for one year. You --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I don't know. You don't know my wife and daughter, Mr. President. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim would take it. That's -- he'll take it only --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, they're actually pretty thrifty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Only for a year. You just need it for one year. That's right. Anyway.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So the workers -- they are surprised at that. But, you know, back to the days of Kilgore and having worked there so long -- I tell people I started when I was eight, because I can't believe how long I've worked there now --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MS. HENSON: But the truth is, there are very capable people at TVA that love --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll bet.</p><p>MS. HENSON: -- the TVA and the mission that they're really -- were put together for and would love to take that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I even think they like your President -- your current President, anyway. I'm not sure about the past President.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Tennessee Valley is -- that's right. The boats on the lake all say, you know --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \"Trump.\" Yeah. No, they're great people. Say hello to them. Just say hello. They're great people.</p><p>Sara, why don't you just discuss it real quick, and you can maybe work with us in getting it all done very quickly. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Of course, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for having us and having everyone here and for all you're doing with regard to immigration. Immigration should be about America, Americans, and the immigrants. Right now -- the way it was, before you started working on it, it's always been the big business, big tech, and universities. And with you, we are working to make immigration in America for the right reasons.</p><p>And Protect U.S. Workers -- I endorsed you in 2016, we endorse you in 2020, and we know for a fact that \"Slow Biden\" and the Democrats will never push towards immigration that benefits Americans, America, and the immigrants. And I think they hide behind: \"Nationalists are bad, immigrants are kind and good.\" And if we are against the immigration the way it is now, then we are \"racists.\"</p><p>But the reality is, if you can keep immigration the way it's going now, the way Joe Biden will push it, the problem is you're actually benefiting the big tech billionaires and universities, and that is not what immigration is about in this country.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Where you come up with the name \"Slow Biden\"? You know, so many people want me to use that term, and I say, \"It's too mean; it's too nasty.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Oh, no! That means I'm mean.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you just come up with that term. And where did that come from? Is that the --</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: My son, actually, who's 11.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your son? He's 11?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: If he's 11, and he said he's slow and that he shouldn't be President --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: They need to pay your son $15 million in consulting. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Actually, during the rallies in 2016, you met my son. He had a Thor, and he dressed him up like President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, that's great.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's very nice. Thank you, Sara. Very -- great job you're doing.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELLL: Thank you so much. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for all you do.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay, Mike. Go ahead. We'll knock it out, Sara.</p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'll be -- I'll just be very brief.</p><p>Four years ago, when you ran for this office, you said the forgotten men and women in America would be forgotten no more. You said that we'd put America first and American workers first, you said that American workers would have a seat at the table in this administration, and we'd deliver real results.</p><p>And today, we see all that happen right in front of us. Because of your leadership indicated during this meeting, that the TVA is going to reverse course on their plan to use H1-B visa workers to replace hardworking Americans. And I can see the gratitude and the emotion on faces around the room, Mr. President, and the gratitude that these people feel and all those that will be reading about this and hearing about this in the days ahead.</p><p>But I also just want to say, finally, to all the -- all the great Americans who gathered here, who have been willing to speak up: Know that with the executive order the President is signing today, we're not just solving your problem. What the President is committing to today is to end the abuse of our worker visa program once and for all, and pulling together multiple agencies to do that. And I want to promise you that you've not only gone out and been a champion for fellow workers at TVA, but you've been champions for American workers all across this country.</p><p>And I know I speak on behalf of the President and our whole administration when I thank you. Thank you for stepping up for American workers and making it possible for this President to keep one more promise to working Americans. God bless you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. So we're going to sign a little document now. Is that okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: I would love that. Thank you, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it's very important one, aligning federal contractors and contracting and hiring practices with the interests of the American workers, which is very simple -- which actually just boils down to pretty much what we're talking about today. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much, President Trump.</p><p>(The executive order is signed.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Here, give that to Sara because she was there very early. (Distributes signing pen.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I have to give -- I have to give one to you. You got us moving here. That's good. Will you pass these around the table, Mike? We'll just pass them on that side. You'll pass them on this side. Everybody that doesn't get it -- (distributes signing pens.)</p><p>So here we are.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I'll get you one, Tim. Don't worry.</p><p>So, thank you very much everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>We're going to be -- we're going to be discussing, very shortly, a immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It'll be a very, very comprehensive bill. That's a word that some people love and some people hate, but it'll be very comprehensive only in the sense that it'll cover just about everything.</p><p>It'll be based on merit. It will be -- it'll cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to. And I think it'll be bipartisan, in the sense that people are going to like a lot of the things that are in there. And probably some people won't; we're going to have that. And we'll probably do it maybe a little bit after our convention. We'll sign it after the convention.</p><p>Likewise, we're going to be doing a healthcare bill -- act -- and it'll be extremely comprehensive. It will cover a lot of things that nobody thought you would be able to get, and -- I mean, in a positive way. And I think it'll be very popular. And it will be a great thing for our country.</p><p>In addition, we have many other things. But immigration and healthcare -- it doesn't get much bigger than that. Immigration will be very merit-based, but it'll be -- it'll be great for the worker, and it'll be great for people coming into our country -- but coming into our country legally and loving our country and wanting to help our country, as opposed to people coming in and they don't like our country.</p><p>You see that, and you see that with certain of our politicians that ran for office. I say, \"I don't think they like our country too much. All they do is complain.\" And you would never tell them to go back to their own country because that would be inappropriate, wouldn't it? But all they do is complain about our country, and their country is going to hell. So, you know, it's sort of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>So the -- the merit-based immigration is going to be incredible, and the healthcare bill or act is going to be something that I don't think anybody in this country thought they'd ever see. And we've done much of that. If look at some of the legislation that we passed, Ken, I think you can say very strongly we've -- we've gotten things passed that nobody would be possible.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Whether it's Right to Try -- that's where you're terminally ill and you don't have a right to use our great medicines because they haven't been approved -- they're in a line of approval and it takes some time. We've cut the time in half, by the way, for approval by the FDA. But people are sick.</p><p>We have very promising drugs and they're not allowed to use them because -- I mean, they're terminally ill and they wouldn't let them use them because of liability and other things, but I got that taken care of. So, Right to Try was a very important one.</p><p>Getting Veterans Choice was so important -- having Veterans Choice. Nobody thought we could get that. Hasn't been done in 50 years. They haven't been able to get it. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Accountability. Because we have so many other things. So many things.</p><p>And on the border, Ken, we've done things that nobody thought would have been possible. Right? Do you want to name a couple of them?</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: We're making enormous progress in the -- especially in the regulatory arena: reestablishing the 140-year-old American tradition of inviting immigrants here who can stand on their own two feet, as -- much like Sara had said. And to add to this country and not -- while not becoming a burden on the country.</p><p>We've also -- the security that you've advocated for and pushed us to achieve has been unprecedented on a border that we still have more work to do. But we --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great progress.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: -- the amount of improvement in three years is just extraordinary.</p><p>And one more piece of legislation you know is near and dear to my heart that you led is criminal justice reform, which was -- you know, lots of people before you talked about it, and this is the first administration to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Nobody else could've gotten that done. Nobody. And we really thank Ken, but we thank a lot of people that came through.</p><p>By the way, some conservative -- very conservative really wanted it and some liberal wanted it. But we got criminal justice reform done. Nobody thought that was possible. The biggest beneficiary is African Americans and Hispanic Americans, I would say -- and Asian Americans -- the three, the groups.</p><p>But tremendous benefits and -- you know, it's really amazing. When we got that done, we had people supporting that that I would've never thought would've supported it. Not for bad reasons, but they would've never supported it, and they actually led the way. It's pretty incredible. Criminal justice reform was a big deal. You know that, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So -- and you were helpful actually, and I appreciate it. And thank you very much. Anybody have a question?</p><p>Q Yes, Mr. President --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, on TikTok: You said over the weekend --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q -- that you're planning to ban it. I know that you spoke with the CEO of Microsoft after that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I did.</p><p>Q So can you give us an update on --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q -- where you're at?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We had a great conversation. He called me to see whether or not -- how I felt about it. And I said, \"Look, it can't be controlled, for security reasons, by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can't be.\" And here is the deal: I don't mind if -- whether it's Microsoft or somebody else -- a big company, a secure company, very -- a very American company buy it. It's probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. Because they say, \"How do you do 30 percent? Who's going to get the name?\" The name is hot; the brand is hot. And who's going to get the name? How do you do that if it's owned by two different companies?</p><p>So my personal opinion was: You're probably better off buying the whole thing rather than buying 30 percent of it. I think buying 30 percent is complicated. And I suggested that he can go ahead. He can try. We set a date -- I set a date at around September 15th, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States. But if somebody -- and whether it's Microsoft or somebody else -- buys it, that'll be interesting.</p><p>I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it. Because I guess it's China, essentially, but more than anything else. I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we're making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now, they don't have any rights, unless we give it to them. So if we're going to give them the rights, then it has to come into -- it has to come into this country.</p><p>It's a little bit like the landlord/tenant: Without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what's called \"key money,\" or they pay something. But the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money, because without the United States, they don't have anything -- at least having to do with the 30 percent.</p><p>So I told him that. I think we're going to have -- maybe a deal is going to be made. It's a great asset. It's a great asset. But it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it'll close down on September 15th, unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal -- an appropriate deal. So the Treasury of the -- really, the Treasury, I guess you would say, of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money. Okay?</p><p>Q Mr. President, can you explain why so many of the public health experts on the coronavirus task force are contradicting you on things like why the virus is so widespread in this country, on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine? Why are so many of these people on your task force contradicting you?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we're doing a great job. I think we're doing great on vaccines. We're doing great on therapeutics. You'll be seeing that very soon. I think we're -- when you look at a map, this is a map of the -- I've got -- I sort of shown that around a little bit, but that's -- the red is the area of most concern. (Displays a U.S. map.) Pretty recent map of the -- of the country. And there's a lot of -- a lot of people that -- in a lot of areas that have gotten very -- you know, better very fast.</p><p>Hydroxy has tremendous support, but politically, it's toxic because I supported it. If they would have said, \"Do not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances,\" they would have come out and they would've said, \"It's a great -- it's a great thing.\" Many doctors have come out strongly in favor of it. They want it very badly. It's a great malaria drug.</p><p>So, for many years --</p><p>Q But Admiral Giroir says it's not effective.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me finish my -- let me finish my answer.</p><p>So for many years -- it's, I guess, 60 years it's been a malaria drug; very successful, as you know. And it's been also a drug for lupus. And it caused no trouble -- virtually nothing, in terms of causing people to get sick or having problems with anything. You add the zinc and you add the azithromycin -- the Z-Pak, as they call it -- and it's been very -- I happened to take it myself, the threesome.</p><p>I took it myself for a period of two weeks. I mean, I -- I had no problem. I had no problem whatsoever. And, importantly, I, you know, didn't test positive. That's very nice. Okay? I'm very happy about that negative.</p><p>And so -- so that's the story. It's -- it's very highly thought of. Interestingly, a great doctor, from what I understand -- a great doctor from Yale feels very strongly about hydroxychloroquine.

TheOffice of Science and Technology Policy and theOffice of Management and Budget co-authored a memo outlining that strategy on Tuesday, having also named national security, agricultural solutions, modern medicine, and energy as other fields in which the government is planning to invest moving forward. </p><p>The plan is in line with research and development ambitions that have been pursued by anumber of U.S. administrations, including the one headed by President Trump. The 2020 fiscal year starts on October 1, 2019. The federal agencies whose purview encompasses any one of the areas outlined above may hence have their budgets increased by Congress moving forward, or at least that's what the White House will push for once the 2020 budget is on the legislators' immediate agenda. Washington is also looking to help basic research in those fields through deregulation, having also encouraged its agencies to do the same, i.e. eliminate as much administrative red tape to tech R...s possible. The White House is also supportive of the idea of government agencies partnering with private companies on such efforts, the memo indicates. The same document argues in favor of extra commitments to the creation of new cybersecurity technologies[1] and the improvement of existing solutions in the sector, while also pushing for new investments in border surveillance. The Trump administration recently became more proactive in the technology segment, having started discussing the possibility of new regulations meant to protect user privacy[2]. While a U.S. version of the European Union's General Data Protection[3] Regulation is unlikely due to the fundamental differences in the political landscapes of the two Western allies, a less strict legislative framework regulating big tech in the country might still end up being enacted in the near future. Washington's tech policy may also be affected by the outcome of the November mid-terms which could see the Republican party lose its majority in both Congress houses.
