The social media group's announcement last week that it wants to expand into payments and launch its own coin Libra has focused minds of regulators and central bankers, the BIS said.</p><p><br/> Such a move by Big Tech mixes extensive data on individuals with activities that could potentially undermine financial stability, the BIS said. It touches on competition, data privacy, markets and banking, all areas that have their own regulators that would need coordinating, Hyun Song Shin, economic adviser and head of research at the BIS, told reporters. \"To make that coordination possible, I think there would need to be more of a concerted effort on the part of our political leaders to take that forward,\" Shin said.<br/> The Group of Seven economies is looking at Facebook's plans, but no single global authority has taken the lead role so far. Shin suggested it could be up to the Group of 20 economies (G20), a body that last year failed to muster consensus that went beyond gathering more information on crypto assets.<br/> \"The role of Big Tech in finance introduces very many new and very unfamiliar elements which pushes us to take a fresh look at some of the activities that international policymakers engage in,\" Shin said. \"This is something that needs attention sooner rather than later.\"<br/> COURTESY MEETING Shin said the BIS, a forum for central banks based in Basel, Switzerland, had a \"courtesy meeting\" with the initiators of the Libra project ahead of its announcement, but knows no more than what the social media company has made public. He added that questions over what kind of regulation Libra would be subject to did not come up in the meeting, declining to give details of when it took place.<br/> Banks have so far faced external competition in payments from financial technology (fintech) firms, but many are relatively small and without the depth of data that the likes of Google, Alibaba, Amazon, Apple and eBay have to hand. On Sunday the BIS published a chapter on Big Tech in finance from its annual economic report. It looked at the sheer volume of data held by social media, search engines and ecommerce firms, putting them at an immediate advantage over fintech firms and banks.<br/> Their entry into finance could spark rapid change in financial services as the broad range of data on consumer behaviour and preferences paints a more detailed picture of a person's creditworthiness, the BIS said. Banks typically rely on credit scores.<br/> While Big Tech could mean financial services becoming available to people normally shut out of banking, it also raises potential data privacy and competition issues, Shin said. It was early days regarding the impact of Libra if it goes ahead. \"We need to see much more before we can come to a judgment,\" Shin said.<br/> Regulators will need to decide how the activity of Facebook and others in finance fits into existing, regulated categories. The same activity should face the same regulation, the BIS paper said, though Shin added: \"We should not rule out a new approach that fits better.\" But even the biggest forays by Big Tech into finance, such as in money-market funds in China, represent a tiny fraction of total banking deposits, the BIS said.<br/> \"Banks are not in imminent danger of being squeezed out,\" Shin said. \"It would not be right to be alarmist here as the banks still have a very big advantage.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANKFI-n11056044</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANKFI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDT-G6M1-JBYT-H430-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Banking and Finance : Policy Changes</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 25, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC6099 FUNCTIONS RELATED TO DEPOSITORY BANKING, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The other covering the legitimate business uses of the technology can be found here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Manipulated media enhanced by artificial intelligence and machine learning is becoming more common, and lawmakers and tech giants have begun to explore remedies. But some industry experts say big tech companies should be doing more to combat abuse of the technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The emerging technology, known as \"deepfakes,\" has gone viral in recent months on platforms like Facebook Inc. and Instagram Inc., stoking public awareness and debate about the integrity of the content found on social websites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A recent survey from Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan \"fact\" tank, found that 77% of 6,127 U.S. adult respondents support restrictions on publishing and accessing altered videos and images. The survey also found that 61% of U.S. adults do not think the public should have the burden of recognizing altered videos and images.</p><p>\"Now that this [deepfake technology] has gotten into the hands of basically the novice, one person can do as much damage as an entire graphic arts [team] could five years ago,\" said David Doermann, director of the University of Buffalo's Artificial Intelligence Institute in New York.</p><p>Big tech's response</p><p>Siwei Lyu, director of the Computer Vision and Machine Learning Lab at the University of Albany, State University of New York, said tools used to create deepfakes are becoming as accessible as popular photo-editing software, such as Adobe Systems Inc.'s Photoshop, which is readily available to consumers.</p><p>\"You can have all these knobs and you can turn up and down these knobs to actually make several changes to the faces and expressions,\" said Lyu, who leads a research group that works on detecting and combating deepfakes.</p><p>Lyu said the first thing big social companies should do is implement detection algorithms to \"stop those fake videos at the doorstep before they can actually be propagated on the internet.\"</p><p>When asked about the work Facebook is doing to combat deepfakes, a company spokesperson confirmed it has engineering teams working on designing systems to identify manipulated media. The spokesperson also said that part of Facebook's work involves \"getting outside feedback from academics, experts and policymakers.\"</p><p>In May, Facebook announced it would partner with the University of Maryland, Cornell University and the University of California, Berkeley to research new techniques to detect manipulated media across images, video and audio. The company also rolled out fact checking for photos and videos in 2018. This process uses a machine learning model to identify potentially false content and sends it to fact checkers for review.</p><p>A fake video featuring Barack Obama shows elements of facial mapping used in deepfake technology.Source: Associated Press</p><p>Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC and Twitter Inc. did not respond to requests for comment about what they are doing to combat deepfakes, though Google has previously said it is using deep-learning models to create collections of synthetic speech to help advance fake audio detection. Lyu's research also was, in part, funded through a Google Faculty Research Award.</p><p>Beyond detecting media as it is uploaded, Lyu said companies should dedicate resources to weed out existing deepfakes on their platforms.</p><p>\"They have the resources to do that,\" he said, noting that YouTube LLC can quickly filter videos involving violent language or hate crimes and can do \"this kind of detection and filtering\" also.</p><p>Doermann, meanwhile, would like to see large platforms be more transparent about the work they are doing to combat manipulated media. According to Doermann, who also previously carried out research as a program manager on computer vision, human language technologies and voice analytics at a U.S. Department of Defense agency, big tech needs to make their efforts to detect and mitigate deepfakes public and to \"educate their people and work together.\"</p><p>Risks</p><p>From an investor perspective, deepfakes themselves do not pose a unique risk to big tech companies, but they do represent one issue in a series of ongoing risks, such as privacy concerns, and whether the platforms incite violence, said Jonas Kron, senior vice president and director of shareholder advocacy at Trillium Asset Management, in an interview.</p><p>\"A lot of our thinking about these issues and what we're asking of the companies and what we're looking for ... lands more in the governance realm, in terms of   is the company holding itself to certain human rights obligations in a meaningful way,\" Kron said.</p><p>Kron also said a substantial legal risk could emerge if Congress reforms Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet platforms from civil and state criminal prosecution for content created and posted by users. Members of Congress have floated the idea amid conversations about how to regulate big tech.</p><p>\"230 is about shielding it from slander and libel laws, that creates a shield against defamation,\" Kron said. \"That is what a deepfake essentially is. So if that 230 protection goes away, then, sure, the sky is the limit in terms of legal liability.\"</p><p>Additionally, Kron noted that deepfakes could pose a risk to future product development at major online platforms.</p><p>\"Future business may be curtailed or challenged because of the lack of trust that comes from these controversies,\" he said of ongoing scrutiny of big tech. \"For so many companies ... it's really all about the next big thing, and if the next big thing withers on the vine because of the lack of trust, that's a problem.\"</p><p>The solution to the litany of risks confronting big tech, Kron said, could be to adopt governance reforms, rather than address each issue individually.</p><p>\"The risks are popping up all over the place, which is why I think governance reforms are worth considering, because they have the potential to provide systems to address a multitude of problems, rather than creating a solution to each problem,\" he said.</p><p>Policy proposals</p><p>As for what role Congress will play, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the committee that hosted a hearing on deepfakes last month, wrote a letter on July 15 attempting to make tech companies' work on the issue clearer. Specifically, Schiff wrote a letter to the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter to learn more about what deepfake policies they have and whether they are conducting research into techniques to automatically detect deepfakes.</p><p>A month earlier, Schiff also introduced a bill that would instruct the director of national intelligence to hold a competition offering an award up to $5 million for people who stimulate \"research, development or commercialization of technologies to automatically detect machine-manipulated media.\" The bill has passed the U.S. House, but has not yet been taken up by the U.S. Senate.</p><p>Companion bipartisan bills in both the House and Senate also were recently introduced that would require the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to publish an annual report on the use of deepfake technology. The report would include a description of technological counter measures that could be used to address \"concerns with digital content forgery technology\" and an assessment of how \"nongovernmental entities\" use deepfakes. Neither the House nor the Senate has taken up the bill yet.</p><p>Advancing more comprehensive legislation does not appear to be a high priority at the moment. In fact, Schiff himself acknowledged legislation at this stage may be premature at the June hearing.</p><p>\"We need to soberly understand the implications of deepfakes, the underlying AI technologies and the internet platforms that give them reach, before we consider appropriate steps to mitigate the potential harms,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-52973731</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRG-MNW1-JDVW-N23B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1297\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

No one should be surprised that 'Break up big tech!' is a major talking point for many 2020 presidential hopefuls. But how, exactly, would this be accomplished? And, what would the world look like in the aftermath?</p><p> Let's start with a list of a few observable techno-facts: We are using more digital technology today than ever before. We will use more digital technology tomorrow than we use today. Technology writ large is way ahead of any policy or law that might govern it. Societal norms and mores cannot keep up with our technological progress. Social media addiction is real. Social media-empowered tribalism cannot be controlled. Echo chambers are virtual vortexes, escape from which requires exceptional force. We have granted a small number of very large companies permission to transform the data that we willingly provide them into wealth. Those companies are doing so with exponentially increasing efficiency. As far as I can tell, nothing being suggested by any politician or pundit will do anything to change any of the above. But let's review.Big TechWhen people say, 'Big Tech' they mean GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft). These companies are both dollar- and data-rich, and they are exceptionally efficient in translating the value of our behavioral data into wealth. Some say that GAFAM are de facto monopolies. They may be, but that doesn't mean they don't vigorously and actively compete for ad dollars with traditional media businesses and with each other. In the past few years, Amazon has gone right after Google and Facebook, snagging about 9 percent of the digital ad sales market. By 2023, it could take as much as 14 percent[2] of total U.S. digital ad sales. No matter how you look at it, you need scale to play this game. Importantly, when you couple the unprecedented decline in ratings with the aging of its audience, television can no longer effectively reach many of the target audiences mass marketers desperately seek. To compensate, big advertisers are in need of data-driven one-to-one marketing at scale, and GAFAM are laser focused at putting the right message in front of the right person in the right place at the right time. GAFAM can do this precisely because they collect and analyze data at scale. Take away the scale and the economics don't work.  I'm not sure how candidates and pundits plan to 'redistribute wealth' after destroying the value of the organizations they wish to tax. That said, let's have a look some candidates' plans for the dismantling of big tech.Joe BidenBiden has yet to formally lay out his tech policy.Elizabeth WarrenUnder Elizabeth Warren's proposal, regulators would be appointed to undo some tech mergers, and new legislation would prohibit[3] 'platforms like Amazon from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace.' Her proposal would also roll back acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp (by Facebook), Whole Foods (by Amazon), and Waze (by Google). She's not backing down, either, having put up a giant tech breakup billboard 'in San Francisco's face[4].' Bernie SandersBernie Sanders supports[5] calls to break up big tech, saying we have 'an increasingly monopolistic society where you have a handful of very large corporations having much too much power over consumers.'Pete ButtigiegWhile Pete Buttigieg thinks[6] no company 'should have the type of power that these tech companies have,' he hasn't said these companies should be broken up. Rather, he's proposed[7] a 'spectrum' of regulation with ideas like fines and preventing new mergers. Andrew YangAndrew Yang has also been outspoken about wanting to break up big tech. The former start-up CEO said[8] they'd be 'well served' if broken up: 'I think in many cases they are too big.' But Yang has other issues with big tech that wouldn't be remedied if they were broken up. Yang's biggest concern is the 'negative effects on young Americans' mental health and the effects of depression and dependency on social media websites,' a problem he says wouldn't be solved by breaking up a company like Facebook.Cory BookerDespite opposing agricultural and pharmaceutical mergers throughout his career as a senator, Cory Booker has countered[9] Warren's ideas: 'I don't think that a president should be running around, pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here.'Other Candidates' PositionsWant more candidates' stances? The New York Times lists[10] 21 Democratic candidates' views on breaking up big tech, among many other topics. An America Without Big TechThere are several legal hurdles to breaking up big tech. As big as Amazon is, its business represents only 5 percent of the total U.S. retail market. Facebook is the largest collection of human beings on the planet, but it offers its services for free. Free is very pro consumer. Alphabet (Google's parent company) is already separated into individual units, each with its own P...so it already acts like a bunch of separate operating companies.  None of this is the point. You will decide how this plays out. You will vote with your wallets. Before you do, think about this: the idea that breaking up big tech will somehow slow the pace of technological advancement is a false premise. For America to be competitive (and digitally secure), we need big infrastructure, big R...big AI, big tech writ large, and the business models to support it. I'm all for watchdog groups, sensible regulation, and laws that protect us from bad actors. I am not in favor of framing big tech as one thing that can be 'fixed' with a soundbite policy.

Frankly, Gaia-X is a horrendously late entrance into a global land grab that has already been won for now.</p><p>It will take a legislative big stick to make corporations unwind all the work they have done to integrate themselves into the Azure and AWS ecosystems, and most business leaders and regulators had the debates about data sovereignty years ago.</p><p>Even Australia's prudential regulator is largely on board with Australian financial services firms committing important data to the cloud ... comfortable that acceptable governance and security provisions are in place. Talking in Sydney last week, IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty was involved in a very interesting panel discussion</p><p>of the existential topic of just what it meant to trust a company in an age when everyone has realised that data is the most valuable global currency.</p><p>\"Our data policy says everything we build has the purpose to augment man-or woman-kind,\" she said. \"The second is that ownership of the data belongs to you, as does its insights.\"</p><p>In other words, IBM has recognised that the second its corporate or government clients even so much as get a sniff of the idea that their data is being snooped on or used by a big cloud company, then they will simply lose the business. It is so far against the commercial incentives of these huge global companies to play ball with their home governments' hypothetical snooping demands that they would arguably up sticks and relocate their operations rather than do it.</p><p>The heads of the biggest tech companies have become almost as statesmanlike and influential as heads of state - particularly as the public can't vote them out.</p><p>Microsoft's Satya Nadella - arguably the most successful public CEO of the past decade - is in Australia this week, speaking publicly at an Australian Financial Review Chanticleer lunch event tomorrow.</p><p>It will be fascinating to hear how he views his role as a tech specialist thrust on to the global political agenda.</p><p>His company's victory over AWS and others in winning an exclusive deal to provide cloud services to the US Department of Defence's AI-based weapons platform (which will be worth $US10 billion) is set to be legally challenged by AWS.</p><p>Nadella will likely rise above any political arguments, and is certainly not accused of colluding with President Donald Trump, but he will know that his words carry weight beyond the techy realm.</p><p>Big cloud computing companies like Microsoft and AWS are the world's most valuable companies because not only are they the custodians of the data that run the planet's companies, they are increasingly the providers of the smarts used to unlock its value with AI.</p><p>That is a lot for any politician to look to challenge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc780zn9lo0o81hx7hqnbd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHX-JM01-JD34-V3SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"892\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But its growing influence and power have also made it the target of lawmakers, regulators, labor unions and corporate rivals like Walmart, and even President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>himself.  That quickly became apparent as critics slammed the proposed taxpayer subsidies for Amazon \u2014 voiced first by one of the Democratic Party\u2019s rising liberal stars, New York Rep.-elect <person><nameText>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, </nameText></person>who decried the \"race-to-the-bottom competition\" for corporate favors, and then by scholars at George Mason University's libertarian Mercatus Center, who wrote that the winning communities are most likely \"throwing their money away.\"  The bipartisan range of negative reactions is no accident, said Matt Stoller, policy director at the nonprofit Open Markets Institute, even as praise for the headquarters selection poured in from elected leaders in both regions. </p><p> \u201cThe reason Amazon is getting so big is that it is just so predatory,\" Stoller said. \"And it\u2019s the predatory aspects of it that are causing people to react against it.\"  Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.  Amazon still has plenty of fans among U.S. consumers: A survey last year ranked it the most trusted big tech company, and an estimated half of American householdshave memberships in its premium Prime service.  Yet its challenges in Washington just start with the man in the White House, who has threatened antitrust action against Amazon and accused it \u2014 without offering evidence \u2014 of unfairly profiting off the U.S. Postal Service. Trump also regularly rages at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.  Meanwhile, lawmakers are seeking an investigation into the company\u2019s connections at the Defense Department, where Amazon is competing for a $10 billion Pentagon contract that would add to its already-massive cloud computing empire. Progressive lawmakers and labor unions have taken aim at the company over workplace safety, employee pay and, indeed, government-subsidized expansions. <person><nameText>Sen. Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>(I-Vt.) weighed in earlier this year with the BEZOS Act, a bill that would tax corporations for every dollar their low-wage workers receive in government assistance.  All this comes as the company's fortunes increasingly depend on decisions in Washington: Amazon is still awaiting federal approval to use drones to deliver packages, nearly five years after Bezos announced its plans on \"60 Minutes,\" for example. At the same time, Bezos\u2019 separate company Blue Origin is seeking a role in the president\u2019s push for an American renaissance in space.  Amazon\u2019s industry rivals have weighed in, too. The clothing and footwear lobby wants Amazon declared a \u201cnotorious marketplace\u201d that traffics in counterfeits. Pharmacy companies, big retailers like Walmart and small merchants are all sounding warnings about what they consider predatory practices. The company also has alarmed UPS and FedEx as it lays the groundwork for its own logistics network that could compete with their package delivery services.  An association of small e-tailers, the Online Merchants Guild, is organizing to fight Amazon in California state court. The group\u2019s first action will be a lawsuit challenging tax collection practices that benefit Amazon and hurt its small sellers, guild founder Paul Rafelson told POLITICO on Tuesday.  Even WikiLeaks has gotten in on the anti-Amazon game, publishing in October a confidential document that purports to map the location of the company\u2019s data centers. For some, the \u201cAmazon atlas\u201d confirmed suspicions that the controversial Pentagon contract proposal was written with Amazon in mind.  Even so, the company's new headquarters in Crystal City and Queens will bring thousands of new employees \u2014 read: voters \u2014 and give Amazon an opening to make new friends in powerful places. Those include some lawmakers with an eye on the 2020 presidential race. As a corporate citizen that employs thousands of constituents in those districts, Amazon will have their attention more than ever before.  New York is home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who sets the chamber\u2019s Democratic agenda, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a likely contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. In Virginia, Sen. Mark Warner is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and a proponent of tighter oversight of the tech industry, an issue that will greatly affect Amazon.  Some of those elected leaders were quick to offer praise for Amazon's choice Tuesday.  \"We've seen that major investments like these can bring not only thousands of direct jobs but also lead to job growth in other industries,\" Warner said in a statement. \"As we welcome Amazon's new investment in Virginia, we must commit to implementing this announcement in a way that will benefit the whole region and all of the Commonwealth.\u201d  In the House, Amazon's Long Island City location will fall within the district of Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the top Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee. Democratic Rep. Don Beyer, the No. 2 Democrat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, will be the company's representative from Virginia.  Amazon employees also are likely to settle down in districts represented by New York Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, who is making a bid to lead the House Democratic Caucus, and Jerry Nadler, the presumed chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee antitrust hearings.  \u201cThey're going to have a footprint in major areas that have big delegations and have tended to have more influential members,\" said Bruce Freed, president and co-founder of Center for Political Accountability, which advocates for transparency in corporate political spending. \"It means they're going to be much more sensitive to Amazon\u2019s interests or its needs.\"  Even before HQ2 mania, Amazon\u2019s company\u2019s lobbying presence in Washington had expanded rapidly. The company spent $12.8 million to influence federal policy last year, a record it\u2019s on pace to smash again this year. That\u2019s an increase of more than 400 percent since 2012, when the company spent a modest $2.5 million on lobbying.  The company's policy portfolio has expanded along with its business interests, from entertainment and cloud computing to groceries and self-driving cars. Its traditional e-commerce issues \u2014 online sales tax, electronic payments and data privacy \u2014 have been joined over time by copyright infringement and music licensing, drone testing, artificial intelligence and federal I.T. modernization.  To up its government game, Amazon has been hosting Washington decision makers at its Seattle headquarters, flooding a company Twitter feed with images of lawmakers at HQ1, including Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington state, and Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) in recent months. State and local lawmakers stop in at Amazon offices and fulfillment centers in Michigan, Indiana, Virginia, Arizona and Georgia, to name a few.  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis got his Bezos-led tour in August 2017, as Amazon was being drawn into a war with other tech giants over the $10 billion contract to move Pentagon data to the cloud. In July, the department had solicited proposals on a winner-take-all contract that seemed designed to favor Amazon. Oracle filed a protest on Aug. 6. A few days latter, Mattis was schmoozing in Seattle.  \u201cA pleasure to host Secretary of Defense James Mattis at Amazon HQ in Seattle today,\u201d Bezos wrote on Instagram.  IBM followed suit with a bid protest in August, writing that the contract\u2019s \u201crigid\u201d requirements \u201cserve only one purpose: to arbitrarily narrow the field of bidders.\u201d The companies have launched lobbying and media campaigns that got the attention of lawmakers.  On Oct. 22, House Appropriations Committee members Steve Womack (R-Ark.) and Tom Cole (R-Okla.) asked for an investigation. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN994927020181115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRM-P5N1-J9XT-P3DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1438\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

'And it\u2019s the predatory aspects of it that are causing people to react against it.'</p><p>Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Amazon still has plenty of fans among U.S consumers: A survey last year ranked it the most trusted big tech company, and an estimated half of American householdshave memberships in its premium Prime service.</p><p>Yet its challenges in Washington just start with the man in the White House, who has threatened antitrust action against Amazon and accused it \u2014 without offering evidence \u2014 of unfairly profiting off the U.S Postal Service. Trump also regularly rages at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.</p><p>Meanwhile, lawmakers are seeking an investigation into the company\u2019s connections at the Defense Department, where Amazon is competing for a $10 billion Pentagon contract that would add to its already-massive cloud computing empire. Progressive lawmakers and labor unions have taken aim at the company over workplace safety, employee pay and, indeed, government-subsidized expansions. <person><nameText>Sen. Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>(I-Vt.) weighed in earlier this year with the BEZOS Act, a bill that would tax corporations for every dollar their low-wage workers receive in government assistance.</p><p>All this comes as the company's fortunes increasingly depend on decisions in Washington: Amazon is still awaiting federal approval to use drones to deliver packages, nearly five years after Bezos announced its plans on '60 Minutes,' for example. At the same time, Bezos\u2019 separate company Blue Origin is seeking a role in the president\u2019s push for an American renaissance in space.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s industry rivals have weighed in, too. The clothing and footwear lobby wants Amazon declared a \u201cnotorious marketplace\u201d that traffics in counterfeits. Pharmacy companies, big retailers like Walmart and small merchants are all sounding warnings about what they consider predatory practices. The company also has alarmed UPS and FedEx as it lays the groundwork for its own logistics network that could compete with their package delivery services.</p><p>An association of small e-tailers, the Online Merchants Guild, is organizing to fight Amazon in California state court. The group\u2019s first action will be a lawsuit challenging tax collection practices that benefit Amazon and hurt its small sellers, guild founder Paul Rafelson told POLITICO on Tuesday.</p><p>Even WikiLeaks has gotten in on the anti-Amazon game, publishing in October a confidential document that purports to map the location of the company\u2019s data centers. For some, the \u201cAmazon atlas\u201d confirmed suspicions that the controversial Pentagon contract proposal was written with Amazon in mind.</p><p>Even so, the company's new headquarters in Crystal City and Queens will bring thousands of new employees \u2014 read: voters \u2014 and give Amazon an opening to make new friends in powerful places. Those include some lawmakers with an eye on the 2020 presidential race. As a corporate citizen that employs thousands of constituents in those districts, Amazon will have their attention more than ever before.</p><p>New York is home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who sets the chamber\u2019s Democratic agenda, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a likely contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. In Virginia, Sen. Mark Warner is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and a proponent of tighter oversight of the tech industry, an issue that will greatly affect Amazon.</p><p>Some of those elected leaders were quick to offer praise for Amazon's choice Tuesday.</p><p>'We've seen that major investments like these can bring not only thousands of direct jobs but also lead to job growth in other industries,' Warner said in a statement. 'As we welcome Amazon's new investment in Virginia, we must commit to implementing this announcement in a way that will benefit the whole region and all of the Commonwealth.\u201d</p><p>In the House, Amazon's Long Island City location will fall within the district of Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the top Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee. Democratic Rep. Don Beyer, the No. 2 Democrat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, will be the company's representative from Virginia.</p><p>Amazon employees also are likely to settle down in districts represented by New York Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, who is making a bid to lead the House Democratic Caucus, and Jerry Nadler, the presumed chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee antitrust hearings.</p><p>\u201cThey're going to have a footprint in major areas that have big delegations and have tended to have more influential members,' said Bruce Freed, president and co-founder of Center for Political Accountability, which advocates for transparency in corporate political spending. 'It means they're going to be much more sensitive to Amazon\u2019s interests or its needs.'</p><p>Even before HQ2 mania, Amazon\u2019s company\u2019s lobbying presence in Washington had expanded rapidly. The company spent $12.8 million to influence federal policy last year, a record it\u2019s on pace to smash again this year. That\u2019s an increase of more than 400 percent since 2012, when the company spent a modest $2.5 million on lobbying.</p><p>The company's policy portfolio has expanded along with its business interests, from entertainment and cloud computing to groceries and self-driving cars. Its traditional e-commerce issues \u2014 online sales tax, electronic payments and data privacy \u2014 have been joined over time by copyright infringement and music licensing, drone testing, artificial intelligence and federal I.T modernization.</p><p>To up its government game, Amazon has been hosting Washington decision makers at its Seattle headquarters, flooding a company Twitter feed with images of lawmakers at HQ1, including Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington state, and Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) in recent months. State and local lawmakers stop in at Amazon offices and fulfillment centers in Michigan, Indiana, Virginia, Arizona and Georgia, to name a few.</p><p>Defense Secretary Jim Mattis got his Bezos-led tour in August 2017, as Amazon was being drawn into a war with other tech giants over the $10 billion contract to move Pentagon data to the cloud. In July, the department had solicited proposals on a winner-take-all contract that seemed designed to favor Amazon. Oracle filed a protest on Aug. 6. A few days latter, Mattis was schmoozing in Seattle.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure to host Secretary of Defense James Mattis at Amazon HQ in Seattle today,\u201d Bezos wrote on Instagram.</p><p>IBM followed suit with a bid protest in August, writing that the contract\u2019s \u201crigid\u201d requirements \u201cserve only one purpose: to arbitrarily narrow the field of bidders.\u201d The companies have launched lobbying and media campaigns that got the attention of lawmakers.</p><p>On Oct. 22, House Appropriations Committee members Steve Womack (R-Ark.) and Tom Cole (R-Okla.) asked for an investigation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1879039I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRN-8H51-F0YC-N04B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

'And it\u2019s the predatory aspects of it that are causing people to react against it.'</p><p>Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Amazon still has plenty of fans among U.S consumers: A survey last year ranked it the most trusted big tech company, and an estimated half of American householdshave memberships in its premium Prime service.</p><p>Yet its challenges in Washington just start with the man in the White House, who has threatened antitrust action against Amazon and accused it \u2014 without offering evidence \u2014 of unfairly profiting off the U.S Postal Service. Trump also regularly rages at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.</p><p>Meanwhile, lawmakers are seeking an investigation into the company\u2019s connections at the Defense Department, where Amazon is competing for a $10 billion Pentagon contract that would add to its already-massive cloud computing empire. Progressive lawmakers and labor unions have taken aim at the company over workplace safety, employee pay and, indeed, government-subsidized expansions. <person><nameText>Sen. Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>(I-Vt.) weighed in earlier this year with the BEZOS Act, a bill that would tax corporations for every dollar their low-wage workers receive in government assistance.</p><p>All this comes as the company's fortunes increasingly depend on decisions in Washington: Amazon is still awaiting federal approval to use drones to deliver packages, nearly five years after Bezos announced its plans on '60 Minutes,' for example. At the same time, Bezos\u2019 separate company Blue Origin is seeking a role in the president\u2019s push for an American renaissance in space.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s industry rivals have weighed in, too. The clothing and footwear lobby wants Amazon declared a \u201cnotorious marketplace\u201d that traffics in counterfeits. Pharmacy companies, big retailers like Walmart and small merchants are all sounding warnings about what they consider predatory practices. The company also has alarmed UPS and FedEx as it lays the groundwork for its own logistics network that could compete with their package delivery services.</p><p>An association of small e-tailers, the Online Merchants Guild, is organizing to fight Amazon in California state court. The group\u2019s first action will be a lawsuit challenging tax collection practices that benefit Amazon and hurt its small sellers, guild founder Paul Rafelson told POLITICO on Tuesday.</p><p>Even WikiLeaks has gotten in on the anti-Amazon game, publishing in October a confidential document that purports to map the location of the company\u2019s data centers. For some, the \u201cAmazon atlas\u201d confirmed suspicions that the controversial Pentagon contract proposal was written with Amazon in mind.</p><p>Even so, the company's new headquarters in Crystal City and Queens will bring thousands of new employees \u2014 read: voters \u2014 and give Amazon an opening to make new friends in powerful places. Those include some lawmakers with an eye on the 2020 presidential race. As a corporate citizen that employs thousands of constituents in those districts, Amazon will have their attention more than ever before.</p><p>New York is home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who sets the chamber\u2019s Democratic agenda, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a likely contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. In Virginia, Sen. Mark Warner is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and a proponent of tighter oversight of the tech industry, an issue that will greatly affect Amazon.</p><p>Some of those elected leaders were quick to offer praise for Amazon's choice Tuesday.</p><p>'We've seen that major investments like these can bring not only thousands of direct jobs but also lead to job growth in other industries,' Warner said in a statement. 'As we welcome Amazon's new investment in Virginia, we must commit to implementing this announcement in a way that will benefit the whole region and all of the Commonwealth.\u201d</p><p>In the House, Amazon's Long Island City location will fall within the district of Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the top Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee. Democratic Rep. Don Beyer, the No. 2 Democrat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, will be the company's representative from Virginia.</p><p>Amazon employees also are likely to settle down in districts represented by New York Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, who is making a bid to lead the House Democratic Caucus, and Jerry Nadler, the presumed chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee antitrust hearings.</p><p>\u201cThey're going to have a footprint in major areas that have big delegations and have tended to have more influential members,' said Bruce Freed, president and co-founder of Center for Political Accountability, which advocates for transparency in corporate political spending. 'It means they're going to be much more sensitive to Amazon\u2019s interests or its needs.'</p><p>Even before HQ2 mania, Amazon\u2019s company\u2019s lobbying presence in Washington had expanded rapidly. The company spent $12.8 million to influence federal policy last year, a record it\u2019s on pace to smash again this year. That\u2019s an increase of more than 400 percent since 2012, when the company spent a modest $2.5 million on lobbying.</p><p>The company's policy portfolio has expanded along with its business interests, from entertainment and cloud computing to groceries and self-driving cars. Its traditional e-commerce issues \u2014 online sales tax, electronic payments and data privacy \u2014 have been joined over time by copyright infringement and music licensing, drone testing, artificial intelligence and federal I.T modernization.</p><p>To up its government game, Amazon has been hosting Washington decision makers at its Seattle headquarters, flooding a company Twitter feed with images of lawmakers at HQ1, including Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington state, and Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) in recent months. State and local lawmakers stop in at Amazon offices and fulfillment centers in Michigan, Indiana, Virginia, Arizona and Georgia, to name a few.</p><p>Defense Secretary Jim Mattis got his Bezos-led tour in August 2017, as Amazon was being drawn into a war with other tech giants over the $10 billion contract to move Pentagon data to the cloud. In July, the department had solicited proposals on a winner-take-all contract that seemed designed to favor Amazon. Oracle filed a protest on Aug. 6. A few days latter, Mattis was schmoozing in Seattle.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure to host Secretary of Defense James Mattis at Amazon HQ in Seattle today,\u201d Bezos wrote on Instagram.</p><p>IBM followed suit with a bid protest in August, writing that the contract\u2019s \u201crigid\u201d requirements \u201cserve only one purpose: to arbitrarily narrow the field of bidders.\u201d The companies have launched lobbying and media campaigns that got the attention of lawmakers.</p><p>On Oct. 22, House Appropriations Committee members Steve Womack (R-Ark.) and Tom Cole (R-Okla.) asked for an investigation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1879039I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRN-7SN1-F0YC-N1HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Follow today\u2019s European Council summit, as well as the hearings in the European Parliament for Ireland\u2019s Commissioner-designate Mairead McGuinness and Valdis Dombrovskis, the economy and trade commissioner, on our live blog .     Tips, tales, traumas to the POLITICO Brussels Team at @cgs_atl or [email protected] | View in your browser    QUICK FIXES    Talks stall: The European Parliament and the German presidency of the Council of the EU are pointing fingers at one another as the specter of an EU budget delay looms closer.    Pandemic dilemma: As infections rise, EU political leaders\u2019 travel schedules are facing scrutiny .    EU Influencers: Congrats to the new batch of EU Influencers , an annual list curated by ZN Consulting. You may recognize a few faces, including some of POLITICO\u2019s own.     LOBBYING THE EU    UPDATING TECH\u2019S TRANSPARENCY SETTINGS: Following complaints, Amazon now discloses its membership of the Center on Regulation in Europe (CERRE) think tank and Apple its CERRE and the European Policy Center (EPC) memberships. Facebook told Der Spiegel it was \u201cin the process of updating our entry in the EU transparency register.\u201d    Backstory: Last week, LobbyControl and Corporate Europe Observatory released a report demonstrating that Big Tech companies had not disclosed all the think tanks they were part of in their EU Transparency Register entries.    \u201cBig Tech and think-tanks prefer to keep their ties secret,\u201d the report reads, noting that think tanks did not publish the list of their members in the Transparency Register. LobbyControl also questioned the truthfulness of some entries in the register.    Increasing spending: The study also shows that digital giants are spending more and more on lobbying. Last year, tech giants spent approximately twice as much as the car industry. Google is the biggest spender (\u20ac8 million in 2018), followed by Microsoft and Facebook (\u20ac5 and \u20ac4.25 million in 2019, respectively).    BIG TECH BAN: MEP St\u00e9phanie Yon-Courtin suggested banning Big Tech companies from lobbying EU lawmakers if their CEOs refuse to testify before the European Parliament. \u201cIf they refuse to talk to us, we will shut the Parliament\u2019s doors to them. We can forbid their lobbies or their representatives to speak to us,\u201d the French MEP from the Renew Europe group said in an interview.    In early September, a majority of the Parliament\u2019s political groups supported the idea of a public grilling of Big Tech CEOs, following the example of the United States. The presidents of the Parliament\u2019s groups still have to decide whether to hold hearings and to determine which parliamentary committee would be in charge. (More here for our Tech and Competition Pro subscribers.)    Hold your horses: \u201cWe call on MEPs not to stretch the wording, nor the spirit, of the Parliament rules of procedure when withdrawing access to companies who correctly comply with the Transparency Register requirements,\u201d the Society of European Affairs Professionals VP Paul Varakas told EU Influence. \u201cThe inability to provide a CEO attending a hearing or a committee meeting is not the same as refusing to cooperate, considering the possibility for senior EU affairs professionals representing these companies to answer any questions they might have.\u201d    Facebook, Amazon and Google did not respond to requests for comment.    EU TRANSPARENCY    A GROW-ING CHEMICAL ROMANCE? An NGO has accused the European Commission\u2019s industry department, DG GROW, of being \u201cfar too relaxed\u201d in employing people that used to work in the chemicals industry. In a new report , the Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) claimed that several of the DG GROW officials who commented on a draft of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, which is expected to land on October 14, previously worked for the chemicals industry.    These comments, which POLITICO obtained , showed that a raft of new laws and regulatory initiatives proposed by the Commission\u2019s environment department DG ENV in a first draft were heavily criticized by their colleagues from DG GROW. The CEO report singled out two \u201cex-chemical industry insiders\u201d that commented on the document, one of which worked at A.I.S.E., which represents the makers of cleaning products, between 2016 and 2019 \u2014 before and after which they worked for DG GROW.    A Commission spokesperson said that its recruitment service \u201cdid not identify any personal interest that could lead to a potential or actual conflict of interest. The Appointing Authority concluded there was no risk of conflict of interest.\u201d The Commission added that \u201cthe Unit of the staff member concerned does not have contacts with A.I.S.E.\u201d One Commission official said that \u201call parties, including industries, are working together to combine better health and environmental protection and increased global competitiveness.\u201d    Repetition allegations: The NGO also claimed that DG GROW officials repeated industry arguments in their own commentary of the chemicals strategy. An access-to-documents request showed that the department held nine lobby meetings \u2014 seven of which were with industry \u2014 on the strategy between January and July. Notes from those meetings showed the industry\u2019s \u201cpreference for sticking with the status quo\u201d and other wishes, some of which were repeated in DG GROW\u2019s communication with DG ENV.    RULE OF LAW REPORT: On Wednesday, the Commission unveiled its first rule-of-law audit of all EU member countries . Each country was assessed based on a number of criteria \u2014 among them were rules on conflicts of interest, revolving doors and lobbying transparency.    Germany\u2019s lobbying hole: While sound in other categories, \u201cGermany does not have a lobby register yet,\u201d the report notes. \u201cAs regards lobbying, the mandatory registration of contacts with both members of the Federal Parliament and members of the Federal Government is missing, although reforms in this area are being considered.\u201d    Countries were consulted in the process of assembling this report. Perhaps this explains why German politicians have changed their tune in recent months on the establishment of a mandatory lobby register, which I\u2019ve covered in this newsletter.    Not alone: Lobbying in Bulgaria remains unregulated, its country report notes. Meanwhile, regulation of lobbying in Hungary is \u201cincomplete,\u201d because registration of lobbyists isn\u2019t mandatory to meet with government officials, nor are their contacts disclosed to an independent body. But then countries like Denmark , with the lowest corruption scores, have no clear rules or guidance on contacts with lobbyists.    Read our team\u2019s full analysis of the report here .    OETTINGER\u2019S CONSULTING GIG: The Commission on Wednesday issued its approval for former Commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger \u2018s consulting firm, Oettinger Consulting, which he established in July 2019 (while he was still working in the Berlaymont).    The decision was over a year in the making, going through several rounds of consultations with the Independent Ethical Committee and Oettinger, primarily to determine the scope of his activities, the report shows.    Restrictions: Oettinger can, of course, not lobby the Commission until November 30, 2021; cannot accept contacts from clients that fall under the scope of his work as a commissioner, which are noted as energy, the digital single market, budget and human resources; and must inform the Commission in January, July and December 2021 about his clients and contracts, among the nearly dozen restrictions listed.    Consultancy test case: The Independent Ethical Committee recommended to the Commission that it should \u201cexamine in all cases related to the provision of general consultancy services by a former Member of the Commission whether these restrictions and conditions should be imposed.\u201d    COUNCIL SPONSORSHIP GUIDELINES: A Council working party discussed proposed guidelines for the sponsorship of presidencies on Tuesday. But the guidelines were not adopted. France continued to be the hold-out because it believes the guidelines are too binding (FYI: they are non-binding). Member countries have until today to provide their comments and the Secretariat will then come up with a revised text.    LOBBY REGISTER UPDATE: Political-level talks on a mandatory transparency register will take place on October 6.    **Register today to our Pro Intelligence workshop: How Brussels works. It takes place on October 26 and will give you all the insider information you need on the decision-making process in Brussels. **    GLOBAL GLANCE    US &amp; UK LOBBYISTS TEAM UP: American and British financial lobbyists are joining forces to weigh in more on transatlantic trade talks. The freshly-launched British-American Finance Alliance (BAFA) is aiming to get a seat at the table for industry in trade talks between the U.S. and the U.K.    Goals: Financial industry associations want to shape the future transatlantic trade deal, for instance, by obtaining a ban on data localization, harmonizing stress-testing and capital requirements for banks. In the past, the U.S. refused to include financial services in trade negotiations with the EU but financial lobbyists are more confident as far as the U.K. trade deal is concerned. After the EU, the U.S. is the top destination for U.K. financial exports, which stand at roughly $28 billion per year.    Members of BAFA include the Securities Industry &amp; Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) of the U.S. and TheCityUK, which will have the role of anchor members, providing secretarial services. Here\u2019s the full story by Matei Rosca for our Brexit Transition, Financial Services, Trade and Trade UK Pro subscribers.    ALSTON &amp; BIRD TO ADVISE ARMENIA: The law and lobbying firm Alston &amp; Bird is advising the Armenian government on \u201cits efforts to build on the strategic partnership with the United States in advance of planned diplomatic talks\u201d next month, according to a Foreign Agents Registration Act filing.    \u201cDuring the course of this engagement, Alston &amp; Bird will monitor current events relevant to US-Armenia relations and provide strategic counsel with respect to improvement of that relationship,\u201d former Republican Senator from Kansas Bob Dole , a senior counsel at the firm, wrote in a letter to Varuzhan Nersesyan , the Armenian ambassador to the U.S., filed with the Justice Department. \u201cThese services may include outreach to United States Government officials as well as Members of Congress and their staffs.\u201d    The contract runs through October 14 and is worth $10,000. It was secured before violence flared over the weekend as Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over the embattled region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Here\u2019s our explainer on that conflict .    INFLUENCERS    Shada Islam is BCW Brussels\u2019 newest senior adviser, the consultancy announced Tuesday, after leaving her role as director of the Friends of Europe think tank in June. She also remains senior adviser at the European Policy Centre and has her own company New Horizons Project. \u201cThere is nothing I like more than exploring and counselling on the politics of the European Union, its multi-faceted interactions with Asia and Africa, and the necessity to build a more diverse and inclusive Europe,\u201d she said of her new BCW role.    Former Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso  was appointed chairman of the board of Gavi, the public-private partnership for vaccines. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the Gavi appointment, saying : \u201cI look forward to working together to ensure access to safe and effective vaccines for everyone who needs them, everywhere on Earth.\u201d    The CERRE think tank (which just celebrated its 10-year anniversary) added Lara Natale to the team as director for tech, media and telecom (TMT). Natale previously co-led FTI Consulting\u2019s TMT practice in Brussels.    Steve George joins Rud Pedersen as a senior adviser in its chemicals and environment team, where he will focus on chemicals policy and regulation. He spent the last 20 years at Rolls Royce.    Tim Peters remains the chairman of CDU Brussels, its general assembly decided earlier this week.    Kimon Zorbas leaves Nielsen where he was SVP of government relations and public policy to head up public policy at DATEV.    NGVA Europe elected Timm Kehler as its new president. Kehler has been serving as chairman and CEO of Germany\u2019s leading gas advocacy group Zukunft ERDGAS e. V. since 2013.    Ga\u00ebtan Claeys has left EUGINE and will be heading the Brussels office of the French region Grand Est as of October 1.    Conor Foley \u2018s new consultancy, Prospect Strategies, joined the EU lobby register. Foley left Norton Rose Fulbright in October 2019 to open the New York-based firm. Foley was also previously a partner at Hume Brophy. The entry lists one client, Virtu Financial \u2014 one of the largest financial service providers based in New York.    Franziska Broich is leaving KNA newswire, and journalism, to start a new venture at the European Parliament\u2019s in-house sustainability watchdog, the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, next month.    Wolfgang Blau and Jennifer McGuire  are joining the Reuters Institute as visiting fellows after leaving their roles at Cond\u00e9 Nast and CBC News, respectively.    Lucia Bonova has joined the cabinet of EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager to take over the responsibilities of Michele Piergiovanni , POLITICO has learned. Bonova was the head of the transport mergers unit since the end of 2018. Piergiovanni, who was in charge of antitrust, mergers and cartels in digital and financial services, was promoted to lead the competition cluster within the cabinet after Linsey McCallum was appointed deputy director general for antitrust. The changes will take effect on October 1.    Marcin Cichy was appointed Access Partnership\u2019s senior adviser for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Falling demand, particularly in the all-important Chinese market is causing a slump in sales. The VW emissions scandal has emboldened regulators to enforce far tougher standards on car producers, and in some instances introduce city bans on diesels. This in turn is forcing car companies to ramp up the development and delivery of new electric models. </p><p>All the while, a new generation of urban buyers are being lured towards car-sharing schemes and a shift away from ownership. It's hardly surprising then, that the share prices of many auto giants are down over 20 per cent so far this year, in a market that is otherwise flat. </p><p>For all the seismic shifts in the sector, it is the politicians who seem to be most determinedly steering the car giants towards the kerb. </p><p>Two major announcements on Thursday had evident political fingerprints, despite denials. Ford's decision to shut its engine plant at Bridgend in south Wales was a consequence of several factors, but claims that it has nothing to do with Brexit are a little hard to take. Uncertainty over Britain's plans to leave the EU has clearly fed into the company's calculations. Earlier this year Ford warned that a so-called no-deal exit would have \"catastrophic\" implications for its operations in the country.</p><p>On the continent, the proposed EUR 33 billion merger of FiatChrysler and Renault came unstuck because of French government concerns over safeguarding jobs in France. The government is Renault's largest shareholder. It's likely that officials in France were also concerned about having to fend off pressure from the Italian government if the time came to make cuts at plants there. </p><p>At the same time European and US auto groups are regularly forced to adjust their business plans to fit the mood music emanating from the Trumpian White House. </p><p>These political sidewinds are battering the already unstable industry. The auto giants have plans in train for the big tech and social shifts, often taking shelter in partnerships and consolidation: it's the political intrigue that's likely to cause them to crash. And if there is one lesson we can learn from the UK auto industry, it's that politicians should not be let near the wheel. If in doubt, consider the sorry tale of British Leyland. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3919368</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W93-K441-JC8Y-80PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"382\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 8, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002R1H</classCode><className>FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES &amp;

Today, politicians are basically crowd-sourced AI algorithms, fed by polling data, played by an actor. This becomes even more evident when you get an email from a candidate or visit their site. When you digitally interface with a candidate, you are interacting with that candidate\u2019s customized persona created specifically for you by a complex set of algorithms that very few people fully understand. This means we are all test subjects in an unprecedented sociopolitical experiment that, quite frankly, scares the hell out of me.</p><p>AI is empowering each candidate to present themselves as if that candidate were speaking to us one-on-one. This has always been possible in small groups, at political rallies or even in specially crafted messages. But no politician in history has had the ability to speak to every individual voter one-on-one. Human politicians still can\u2019t, but their AI-generated political avatars can. And frighteningly, these AI-generated political avatars know more about our real hopes and dreams than any human candidate ever could. Need proof? You already know how this works.</p><p>Predictive analytics are now so good that most people believe their devices are spying on them. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. The algorithms predict what you will care about by analyzing what you search, click and hover over\u2014AI-generated political avatars are simply advanced digital marketing tools.</p><p>Whenever you interact with an app (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google) or website or any other online data aggregator (Nest, Alexa, Waze, your smartphone), you are creating two sets of data.</p><p>The first set of data is the data required to enable the technology you are using to work. This might include the location of your device, if you\u2019re using Waze or your smartphone, or the current temperature of your home, if you\u2019re using a Nest thermostat, or what you are interested in at the moment, if you are using social media.</p><p>But you also create a second set of data. Sometimes referred to as \u201csurplus data,\u201d this data is not specifically required to achieve your immediate objective. For example, your location when you tap a like button, the time of day you are usually in your home when you adjust your thermostat or the kinds of images that get your attention when you stop scrolling on a social network.</p><p>Surplus data is collected with the explicit purpose of improving the engineering of bespoke online environments and messaging that you will find irresistible. Said differently, these are the data used by algorithms to feed your social media addiction.</p><p>Where does XYZ candidate stand on universal healthcare, reproductive rights, tax reform, the environment, gun violence prevention? Ask 100 million people, and you\u2019ll get 100 million answers informed by customized messaging because the algorithm will deliver the message it believes matters most to you exactly the way you want to hear it. This is truly new.</p><p>Here\u2019s how it\u2019s done:</p><p>The goal of all targeted messaging (in fact, the goal of all advertising ever created) is simple: put the right message in front of the right person in the right place at the right time. This is not new, and it is not news.</p><p>But AI has changed the game. The amount of (big) data that is available about each and every one of us is simply staggering. We willingly contribute to data-rich organizations such as Google, Facebook and Twitter when using data, and any candidate can appear to be a champion for the causes or issues you are most passionate about.</p><p>Convincing a single-issue voter that a candidate believes what that voter believes is truly child\u2019s play. But life is not that simple. Most voters are not single-issue. Most voters are nuanced and passionate about lots of issues.</p><p>To customize messaging for multi-issue voters, behavioral data is fed into algorithms designed to score those behaviors and then predict what attributes should be crafted into the customized persona of the particular candidate. You can call it \u201cpandering at scale.\u201d</p><p>While this technology is table stakes in best practices digital advertising, dynamic apps and websites, it is relatively new for politicians. They may be late to the game, but they are now using the schooling they received in 2012 from the Obama campaign and in 2016 from the Trump mar-tech machine, and we\u2019re about to get an up-close and personal view of the unintended consequences of the lessons learned.</p><p>The 2020 elections are going to be politically, technically and physically hacked, and there is almost nothing any of us can do about it. But they are also going to be socially hacked. Personalized politics is the number one way that politicians, PACs, criminal hackers, casual hackers and nation-states are going to socially hack the 2020 elections.</p><p>We all love to be blanketed in the comfort of the information we want to hear. But for the 2020 elections,\u00a0we\u2019re going to have to get out of our comfort zones. If you feel strongly about an issue, go visit some politician\u2019s website in incognito mode. No cookie? No personalization.

Breaking up big tech will certainly not have an impact on AI-generated political avatars, customized campaigning or nation-states socially interfering using hyper-targeted messaging for 2020.</p><p>We are going to have to figure out some thoughtful, future-focused way to frame the conversation around data regulation.

Mr. Skripal was a Russian double agent who had moved to Britain in a spy swap. British authorities blamed Russia, calling the incident a \"hostile action\" and moved to expel 23 members of the Russian embassy in London. Days later, Russia responded in kind, expelling 23 Britons. But this diplomatic war was not confined to just the United Kingdom and Russia. Canada got involved in the standoff and expelled four Russians who were trying to \"undermine Canada's security or interfere in our democracy,\" in solidarity with Britain. Canada would also go on to deny visa renewals for three more Russian diplomats who had already left the country to bar them from returning. Diplomatic incidents such as this aren't uncommon, but according to more than 180 pages of documents obtained by The Globe and Mail, Canada's approach to the skirmish differed greatly this year. The Globe's Grant Robertson <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-embassy-games-inside-canadas-diplomatic-standoff-with-russia/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-embassy-games-inside-canadas-diplomatic-standoff-with-russia/</url> that Ottawa didn't want to discreetly dismiss diplomats in an effort to avoid a public international spat, the path usually taken in instances like this. </p><p>Instead, the federal government wanted to send Russia a message. E-mails show that senior Global Affairs Canada staff sought to denounce a \"wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour by Russia,\" not only the attack on the Skripals.</p><p>This is the daily Politics Briefing newsletter, written by <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/mayazalam16\">https://twitter.com/mayazalam16</url> in Toronto while       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/channay\">https://twitter.com/channay</url> is on vacation.

The two provinces have taken different approaches to growing renewables. In Ontario, the government set rates under the now-scrapped Green Energy Act while Alberta holds auctions to see which company can supply the market with the cheapest power. Although Ontario and Quebec remain the two largest producers of renewable electricity, Western provinces are gaining ground. Experts in the wind industry say the heart of the field is near the Crowsnest Pass.</p><p>Federal Liberals have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-federal-ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-to-face-karen-wang-in-byelection/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-federal-ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-to-face-karen-wang-in-byelection/</url> Karen Wang, a daycare owner, in the Burnaby South by-election, which will feature NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

Sunday's vote was touted as a historic election, the first democratic transfer of power in the country's history.

Ms. Hasina's Awami League party won more than 280 seats in the 300-seat Parliament, according to the country's election commission, while the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, won just six seats.

A big one is immigration. The government needs to demonstrate that the large number of irregular border-crossers, and the multi-year delays in deciding their cases, are not the new normal. The Liberals' less-than-urgent handling of this dossier suggests they are still banking on it resolving itself. They may get lucky. But if spring brings a resurgence in irregular crossings, voters could run out of patience. Another issue is pipelines. If the Liberals can get work started on the Trans Mountain expansion in British Columbia by next summer, it will be a win for them. If they don't, it will hang over their heads at election time.

Protests planned for Google's Mountain View headquarters this weekend are inspired by the dismissal of former engineer James Damore.Mike Blake Reuters Brooks Kraft Corbis via Getty Images</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With plans to protest outside Google's offices this weekend, conservatives are taking America's culture wars directly to Silicon Valley, a place that was long insulated from political rancor but is now one of the most important ideological battlegrounds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rallies were inspired by James Damore, the former Googleengineer who was fired last week for posting a 10-page internal memo arguing that the lack of women in tech could be attributed to biological differences. His dismissal sparked an outcry from conservatives who say their opinions are being muzzled by liberal technology companies and led Damore to criticize his former company for promoting a \"particularly intense echo chamber.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The March on Googlestands for free speech and the open discussion of ideas,\" wrote event organizer Jack Posobiec, a conservative media figure who pushed the \"Pizzagate\" and Seth Rich conspiracy theories and was recently retweeted by the president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Posobiec, who did not respond to questions sent to his Facebook page, said the marches planned for Saturday are not alt-right events and that he wanted to avoid the violence and mayhem experienced in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend.</p><p>Protests are planned Saturday at Googleheadquarters in Mountain View and other company offices such as Venice, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Seattle. It's unclear how many people are expected. </p><p>Googledid not respond to a request for comment, and the Los Angeles Police Department said Tuesday that it had no information about a demonstration.</p><p>But the Mountain View Police Department confirmed a planned demonstration for two hours at Charleston Park across from Googleheadquarters. The department said organizers were not connected to Charlottesville participants. </p><p>\"We want you to know that we are working with both Googleand with the event planners to ensure the protest is a peaceful one,\" the department said in a statement.</p><p>Damore told CNBC that he is not involved with the marches, adding, \"I don't support efforts to try to hurt Googledirectly.\"</p><p>Still, his memo pointed to the clash of ideas within the technology industry at a time when its products play an increasingly bigger role in the daily lives of Americans.</p><p>Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, Snapchat and other social media occupy 5\u00bd hours of the average U.S. adult's week, according to Nielsen, a span that has grown sharply in recent years. And the online platforms' power to spread and enforce cultural values has become a matter of contention across the political spectrum.</p><p>Conservatives point to years of evidence of a liberal agenda in the tech industry. They've drawn comparisons between Damore's case and Mozilla Chief Executive Brendan Eich, who stepped down a decade ago following outrage over his support of a ban on same-sex marriage.</p><p>More recently, right-wing activists say YouTube is filtering conservative videos so that they won't appear unless users toggle their settings to accept graphic or potentially offensive content. </p><p>The conditions are a far cry from just a few years ago when technologists were thought of as political neophytes - the descendants of a counterculture that turned hippies into billionaires like Steve Jobs. If there was a political streak in the valley, it tended to be libertarian.</p><p>But the 2016 presidential election demonstrated just how influential the region's platforms are to American public opinion.</p><p>Where would Bernie Sanders' campaign have gone without the rabid support of smartphone-wielding millennials spreading #FeelTheBern? </p><p>And how long would Donald Trump's campaign have lasted without his supporters' memes and the candidate's personal Twitter account? </p><p>Jeremy Carl, a former tech worker who serves as a fellow at conservative think tank Hoover Institution, said the anger among his ideological peers stems from \"egregious\" actions taken by Googleand other big tech companies. </p><p>Efforts to take down or stunt the growth of potentially offensive online publications have reached a \"ridiculous\" level, he said.</p><p>Despite Trump's victory last year with the aid of a fearsome social media strategy, conservatives accuse Facebook, Twitter and Googleof censoring their points of view by suspending accounts and firing employees like Damore who speak out against diversity training.</p><p>\"The recklessness of the industry and its partisan politics have brought us to this point. They have no credibility among the right to do self-regulation,\" said Carl, who has advocated for treating Googleas utility company that must provide a neutral service.</p><p>At stake is the future of news and information in a country where facts are so often viewed through a political lens. Control of these digital platforms, once thought to be apolitical, could swing the national conversation around culture and politics. </p><p>What also irks critics is that there are few alternatives to Googleand Facebook. So conservatives who don't like those companies' politics feel they have no choice but to keep using their services. </p><p>\"Internet people brag about freedom of expression in the U.S. relative to what's available in China, but that's just not the case when you look at the Internet monopolies in the U.S.,\" said Ron Unz, a Palo Alto software entrepreneur who launched unsuccessful campaigns for California governor and English-only education.</p><p>\"You're talking about something closer to modern totalitarianism,\" Unz added.</p><p>(By comparison, China tightly monitors discourse on its closed-off Internet, employing thousands of censors and trolls to promote the government's positions and stifle open dissent.)</p><p>Unz said he thinks tech companies should be held to the same standards as the government when it comes to freedom of expression because of their market dominance, more like utilities. </p><p>It doesn't help either that tech companies operate in near secrecy - driving suspicion that the Googles and Facebooks of the world are stifling conservative views with lines of hidden code.</p><p>\"The tech industry's point of view is embedded deep in the product, not announced on the packaging,\" wrote Ezra Klein, editor-in-chief of Vox. \"Its biases are quietly built into algorithms, reflected in platform rules, expressed in code few of us can understand and fewer of us will ever read.\"</p><p>It's been difficult for Silicon Valley to adapt to the new political order. Many companies are at odds with conservative positions on immigration, climate change and sexual identity - taking stances that seemed safely mainstream until recently.</p><p>Nonetheless, they've tried to appear more welcoming to President Trump and his supporters.</p><p>Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt, head of Google's parent company Alphabet, are among the big names that agreed to advise the president on his technology council.</p><p>Googlehas also tried to hire more conservatives for its lobbying and policy initiatives, and Facebook donated money to the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. The social network also replaced its news editors with an algorithm after conservatives said employees were suppressing right-wing content.</p><p>To be sure, Silicon Valley counts some conservatives and Trump supporters among its list of top entrepreneurs. None is more famous than Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and a billionaire venture capitalist, who spoke strongly in support of then-candiate Trump at the Republican National Convention last year. Thiel, despite running large investment funds, has become an outcast in some circles of the industry for his work with Trump.</p><p>Pierson and Dave write for California News Group, publisher of the Union-Tribune and Los Angeles Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0056536007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P86-B2R1-DY37-F2SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 16, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Personally, I find it exhausting that you can't get your fix of dog photos or engagement announcements on Facebook without seeing a Nigel Farage speech or reading a long-lost friend banging on about austerity. I'm not unusual. Few things unite Remainers and Leavers, but 68pc of both told pollsters this week that they had \"Brexit fatigue.\" A Google search of \"we need more politics in our lives\" is instructive - it returns just two results. Both are ironic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet more politics is precisely what \"democratic socialists\" desire. Not only do the more radical Democrats in the US and Corbyn's Labour want to bring more activity under government control, they also want to extend politics into every nook and cranny of our existence. In commentator Owen Jones's words, modern socialism is \"the democratisation of every aspect of society\". And where there are collective mechanisms for making decisions, there is politics.</p><p>We Brexit voters might be despondent about the merits of democratic expression. But we should fear not. Under socialism, we'd get a democratic voice in the workplace too. Yes, it will start innocuously enough with workers on boards, as in Germany. John McDonnell's so-called \"inclusive ownership fund\" to force large companies to create worker-owners with up to a 10pc stake in their business is the next stepping stone.</p><p>But read the intellectuals of this neo-socialist movement, and you soon see the eventual goal: nationalised industries where possible; enforced mutuals, social enterprises and worker co-operatives for everything else. This form of socialism isn't about eliminating all private property, but shareholder capitalism. Consumer-led capitalism is, in an important sense, already democratic.</p><p>The economist Lionel Robbins once described market competition as the process by which \"thousands of people cast their votes for the hundreds of products and services on offer, and from the competition to win their votes, better and better products and services arise\". Viewed this way, capitalism disperses power. Not according to \"one man, one vote\", but \"\u00a31, one vote.\" For socialists, this power is irrelevant: it's ownership, not consumption, that matters.</p><p>Yet, there's nothing to stop worker or consumer-ownership in a capitalist society either. John Lewis is a company owned in trust for its employees, who receive a share of the profits. Before the days of statutory regulation, even the London Stock Exchange was a mutual. Employee share ownership is common among big tech firms in Silicon Valley and is incentivised through the UK tax code.</p><p>If co-operatives and mutuals really do harness dispersed information and align incentives to engender more economic success, why don't socialists advocate creating these firms and outcompeting shareholder businesses, rather than seeking coercive government edicts?</p><p>The simple answer, of course, is that this co-operative model is not appropriate for all types of business. In fact, for many companies, its roll-out would bring all the maladies we see in politics into our workplaces, while politicising the whole business community at a national level.</p><p>It would be too costly and time-consuming for large firms to have a referendum of worker-owners on every business decision. Disinterested workers with small stakes wouldn't want it anyway. So mechanisms would be needed to aggregate their \"voice\". That means elections or worker-owner representatives on a board, perhaps with fixed terms and term limits.</p><p>But as soon as you introduce that you get all the issues and incentive problems we see in Westminster. Would it be one worker-owner, one vote? Or would full-time management get more votes than part-time or lower-level employees? Short-termism would abound.</p><p>Worker-owners, one would imagine, would vote for people more likely to help them as current employees than ensure longer-term profitability.</p><p>Interest groups would quickly form.</p><p>Older employees would prefer to allocate funds to shore up pension plans. Younger parents would want more in the way of benefits or time-off for parenting or other pursuits, provided it didn't hit near-term profitability too much. All worker-owners might have mixed feelings about investments in laboursaving technologies, R&amp;D projects, or closures of parts of the business, particularly when the effects are highly uncertain or long term.</p><p>The problems above are compounded because, even if a worker-owner did not like the way a company was being run, he or she would have to leave their job. In the former Yugoslavia, all these problems of industrial democracy resulted in underinvestment and slow growth.</p><p>Inevitably, these ownership forms mean the politicisation of the business community itself. Mutuals and co-operatives would find it incredibly difficult to raise capital to start up or survive. That's why socialists advocate regional and national banks to provide funds for new ventures and firm expansion. That, of course, entails the government picking winners and losers - a recipe for severe cronyism. Pretty soon the model of \"worker democracy\" promised becomes a matter for government control.</p><p>All socialist experiments start with the lofty ambition of spreading democracy and empowering workers. The problem is that when the economic impact of \"democratic\" planning bites, or workers' groups deviate from the central government plan, or new businesses need funding, the planning government steps in. Where the state becomes an ever-important financial intermediary, its money comes with conditions.</p><p>Other social ambitions feed into policy.

I agree with him about the ends he tries to achieve but the fundamental problem is the means. We know his own party and the DUP will not accept the current backstop and the only way the government plans to avoid the backstop is to deliver a so called invisible border, but last week we saw a leaked Home Office presentation stating that, and I quote, no government worldwide currently has a system in place and 2030 is the time for the UK and there is currently no budget for either a pilot or for the programme itself. So can the Minister tell us are the Home Office wrong?</p><p> Well, I'm not going to comment on alleged leaks from government departments, but what I can say to the house is that the government has allocated #20 million to invest in work on alternative measures that would bring benefits in terms of seamless trade, both to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but which, if successful, more generally, could be applied to give us smart borders on all of the UK's external borders and perhaps offer us export opportunities for that technology as well. It's interesting what the minister says, but the Home Office also says that there are six problems with deploying the technological solutions. It is expensive, there is no budget. It has to operate with 28 different government agencies. It has to operate on both sides of the border. It won't be deliverable until 2030. With covenant has a poor track record on big tech projects. And nobody in the world has done anything similar. So that, Mr Speaker, is hardly a recipe for success. The real answer to the Northern Ireland border question is staring the government in the face. 28 months ago and two Brexit secretaries ago I told the minister from this dispatch box that the only way to avoid a hard border was staying in a customs union and, of course, the alignment of all rules and regulations and he himself said three years ago that for anybody to pretend otherwise he said flies in the face of reality. That was the truth then and it remains the truth today, so why will the government just not wake up to it? I did say to the Right Honourable lady in our previous exchange that there is a #20 million budget that has already been earmarked for this work. It is also the case, whatever the Right Honourable lady might be reading in the newspapers about timetables, that not just the UK but the European Union has committed itself to try to get these alternative measures agreed by 2020. That is not an undertaking or commitment that the European Commission has entered into lightly and without some thought and analysis about the chances of achieving that. But could I say to the Right Honourable lady, the solution she identifies of needing to have a frictionless border on the island of Ireland is what is delivered by the government's withdrawal agreement. Therefore, what she should be doing is urging her Right Honourable and honourable friends to vote for what the government is proposing instead of rejecting it and therefore blocking the Brexit which her party's manifesto commits her to. Mr Speaker, we've heard it all before, let's face it. The only point the Minister didn't make this time was that Britain must be able to establish her own international trade agreements. Perhaps he has been listening to Nancy Pelosi who made it clear that if the UK Government disrupted the open border in Northern Ireland, we could forget about a free trade deal with the US. So the government will spend millions giving Donald Trump the red carpet and golden carriage treatment in June and maybe the state banquet might be worth it so long as he is forced to sit next to Greta Thunberg. He could have greater on one side and David Attenborough on the other and that would be three hours well spent. But the truth is that it will all be a giant waste of taxpayer money because the US Congress will never agree to a trade deal unless we have a solution for the Irish border that will actually work. And this government simply doesn't have one. It is just two short years ago that the right honourable lady said of President Trump, we should welcome the American President. We have to work with him. I just wonder whether</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCTWO-ec2a5d83475b4e279a649076c6d12347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCTWO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYJ-C6J1-DY08-355X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402047</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

So can the Minister tell us are the Home Office wrong? Well, I'm not going to comment on alleged leaks from government departments, but what I can say to the house is that the government has allocated #20 million to invest in work on alternative measures that would bring benefits in terms of seamless trade, both to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but which, if successful, more generally, could be applied to give us smart borders on all of the UK's external borders and perhaps offer us export opportunities for that technology as well. It's interesting what the minister says, but the Home Office also says that there are six problems with deploying the technological solutions. </p><p>It is expensive, there is no budget. It has to operate with 28 different government agencies. It has to operate on both sides of the border. It won't be deliverable until 2030. With covenant has a poor track record on big tech projects. And nobody in the world has done anything similar. So that, Mr Speaker, is hardly a recipe for success. The real answer to the Northern Ireland border question is staring the government in the face. 28 months ago and two Brexit secretaries ago I told the minister from this dispatch box that the only way to avoid a hard border was staying in a customs union and, of course, the alignment of all rules and regulations and he himself said three years ago that for anybody to pretend otherwise he said flies in the face of reality. That was the truth then and it remains the truth today, so why will the government just not wake up to it? I did say to the Right Honourable lady in our previous exchange that there is a #20 million budget that has already been earmarked for this work. It is also the case, whatever the Right Honourable lady might be reading in the newspapers about timetables, that not just the UK but the European Union has committed itself to try to get these alternative measures agreed by 2020. That is not an undertaking or commitment that the European Commission has entered into lightly and without some thought and analysis about the chances of achieving that. But could I say to the Right Honourable lady, the solution she identifies of needing to have a frictionless border on the island of Ireland is what is delivered by the government's withdrawal agreement. Therefore, what she should be doing is urging her Right Honourable and honourable friends to vote for what the government is proposing instead of rejecting it and therefore blocking the Brexit which her party's manifesto commits her to. Mr Speaker, we've heard it all before, let's face it. The only point the Minister didn't make this time was that Britain must be able to establish her own international trade agreements. Perhaps he has been listening to Nancy Pelosi who made it clear that if the UK Government disrupted the open border in Northern Ireland, we could forget about a free trade deal with the US. So the government will spend millions giving Donald Trump the red carpet and golden carriage treatment in June and maybe the state banquet might be worth it so long as he is forced to sit next to Greta Thunberg. He could have greater on one side and David Attenborough on the other and that would be three hours well spent. But the truth is that it will all be a giant waste of taxpayer money because the US Congress will never agree to a trade deal unless we have a solution for the Irish border that will actually work. And this government simply doesn't have one. It is just two short years ago that the right honourable lady said of President Trump, we should welcome the American President. We have to work with him. I just wonder whether something has changed about the US administration, or whether something has changed about her own leadership ambitions. To alter her words in this way. Which is it?

Either taxes or people putting money is a private sources. Ultimately people have to pay for increased levels of care. The most important thing is the care they get needs to be more cohesive. After all, the NHS picks up the pieces of the broken social care system. </p><p>Either the NHS, we have to bite the bullet and say, maybe they should run this in common with each of their processes of treatment, or local authorities tie themselves to the NHS. There are a big set of decisions to be made, not just money. I actually agree. There is a basic political failure here. Except it never gets signed off? We are reaching for a Green paper from the government that never comes. If it is sensible, my information as we should get behind that and deliver it. So far they are holding back. It is controversial and they are trying to avoid controversy. Will the public actually where the idea of paying more taxes? Damian Green suggesting it is something you do later in life, that you start paying into a scheme that will top up the safety net set by the government, increases contributions. Theresa May was talking about a floor, taking people's comes into account, assessing how wealthy they are and if they can afford their care. There is a big fear among the property stuff. People get very nervous about what that means. They have got inheritance issues, that issue about, you've worked all your life, your home is under threat, that is extremely worrying for people. I think there is an element of younger people, we have had the battle over pensions for years, but younger people recognising there is a degree of having to save for their future in some capacity. Ian is absolutely right. Having seen the coalface of the social care system, how it interacts with the NHS, we can probably all quote cases of complete mismanagement where it doesn't work properly, bits where there is duplication, where the system is flawed. As a result you can immediately say, we could have saved money there, we could have made that work better. They will always be scepticism about the system. The system has to be looked at and the degree of comfort for people. If you are being asked to pay more, you want to know that it is going to be good, that it isn't going to be that you have to go to bed at five o'clock in the evening because that time -- that is the time of the visit from the local authority. Do you think this will go some way to allaying the fears of local authorities? They are at the coalface of a lot of this. I think they will be pleased it is being talked about. It has not been talked about nearly enough. I think the current government's answer has been a sticking plaster to say we put 2% on the council tax, which is not equitable across the country. It is a drop in the ocean in terms of greater Manchester. Gotta sticking plasters but they are not even the same sized sticking plasters across the country. If you are a council, you will be pleased they are talking about it. This is the beginning, really. Will this be solved by the next election? I hope so. I am optimistic in that we are trying to put together a cross-party group to look at this and to make a decision on the basis of what is balanced and right. The truth is, it is the two elements. Where and how do you fund? And how do you change the system so it is much more efficient, better? A very small percentage of those elderly actually end up in homes for any length of time at all, and if they do it is often very short. The idea of not being able to plan a savings model that works and returns you something through a pension, where you actually put money in but you still see the chance of getting that back or returns from housing, what we have to do is get away from the idea that what you put in is dead. It is active. We need to use that to care for the elderly. I am open to all ideas. Let's move on, because if you're on social media, you've probably seen political adverts, but it's not always clear who's targetting you. Have a look at this... I'm Joey D'Urso, I work on the BBC's political coverage, and I've been investigating how elections are fought online. The big tech giants like Facebook and Google will play a huge role in the next election, but how much do we know about the political ads you'll be seeing in your timelines and who is really paying for them? In the EU referendum, the Remain campaign had a bigger budget overall, but Vote Leave chose to pump more money into targeted or dark Facebook ads dark ads are ads which can only be seen by the people targeted by them. That makes it hard for a journalist like me or a regulator to see what's going on. Social media is not just about young people any more. Increasingly, older voters are spending more time online and being targeted by ads.

I think there is an element of younger people, we have had the battle over pensions for years, but younger people recognising there is a degree of having to save for their future in some capacity. Ian is absolutely right. Having seen the coalface of the social care system, how it interacts with the NHS, we can probably all quote cases of complete mismanagement where it doesn't work properly, bits where there is duplication, where the system is flawed. As a result you can immediately say, we could have saved money there, we could have made that work better. They will always be scepticism about the system. The system has to be looked at and the degree of comfort for people. If you are being asked to pay more, you want to know that it is going to be good, that it isn't going to be that you have to go to bed at five o'clock in the evening because that time -- that is the time of the visit from the local authority. Do you think this will go some way to allaying the fears of local authorities? They are at the coalface of a lot of this. I think they will be pleased it is being talked about. It has not been talked about nearly enough. I think the current government's answer has been a sticking plaster to say we put 2% on the council tax, which is not equitable across the country. It is a drop in the ocean in terms of greater Manchester. Gotta sticking plasters but they are not even the same sized sticking plasters across the country. If you are a council, you will be pleased they are talking about it. This is the beginning, really. Will this be solved by the next election? I hope so. I am optimistic in that we are trying to put together a cross-party group to look at this and to make a decision on the basis of what is balanced and right. The truth is, it is the two elements. Where and how do you fund? And how do you change the system so it is much more efficient, better? A very small percentage of those elderly actually end up in homes for any length of time at all, and if they do it is often very short. The idea of not being able to plan a savings model that works and returns you something through a pension, where you actually put money in but you still see the chance of getting that back or returns from housing, what we have to do is get away from the idea that what you put in is dead. It is active. We need to use that to care for the elderly. I am open to all ideas. Let's move on, because if you're on social media, you've probably seen political adverts, but it's not always clear who's targetting you. Have a look at this... I'm Joey D'Urso, I work on the BBC's political coverage, and I've been investigating how elections are fought online. The big tech giants like Facebook and Google will play a huge role in the next election, but how much do we know about the political ads you'll be seeing in your timelines and who is really paying for them? In the EU referendum, the Remain campaign had a bigger budget overall, but Vote Leave chose to pump more money into targeted or dark Facebook ads dark ads are ads which can only be seen by the people targeted by them. That makes it hard for a journalist like me or a regulator to see what's going on. Social media is not just about young people any more. Increasingly, older voters are spending more time online and being targeted by ads. For the younger age</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCTWO-e19dbed918334db58c8af82be43e2da1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCTWO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0M-72P1-DY08-31Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402047</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I don't think those allegations quite stuck, but I do think these ones, at first reading, and I'm just absorbing the report as all of us are, they do seem more concerning, particularly if the fine has already been levied in there seems to be a clear breach. I guess if Leave.EU were here, they would probably say that there has also been lots of allegations on the other side... And we will come to those. For instance, the Lib Dems apparently sold some of their political data to Britain Stronger In Europe. I think in general most of the country wants us to get on with this process and we are completely bogged down in how the referendum was actually conducted... I will just ask. How big a deal do you think this is, because if you listen to what Carol has said, and you listen to Liam saying the people would just like to get on with the referendum, the sort of summary, if you like, from the report from the Information Commissioner says they discovered a disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy, and they found that not just with Leave.EU, but questions to answer from the official Leave campaign and also on the Remain side. We match I think the public is starting to ask serious questions about data, and especially new technology like this would -- I think the public are starting to ask. Technology galloping ahead of the regulatory frameworks, and I think the public take this easily and politicians have two tickets easily. What does that mean? -- take this seriously. It means asking questions about whether the regulations are good enough. This discussion we are having is about specific investigations, and I think it is really important we let them take their course, and we allow those regulators to do their jobs. But, in terms of the future, we know I think that the regulations around elections are probably not what they should be, and I think we are all going to have to work actually on a pretty cross-party basis to get it right for the future. Are you shocked by the revelations? Of course I am. Going forward, the way in which data is managed is going to be a critical thing for any election process, and we always pride ourselves in the UK that is fair and honest and it does not appear to be at first examination, so I would say it is concerning, it is right it is pursued by the officials, as we've heard, and more importantly it is right there are regulations that everyone respects going forward. I think select committees are proving their worth in the House of Commons at the moment. I hope this demonstrates to people that actually there are functions in Parliament that can work well, and we can shift use them off. Grace, where are you on this? I think it is an exam of a more general trend we are seeing, increasingly, the use of Private -- personal data for private profit, and this is a trend that was across as you have said the big tech companies, and we have also seen recently the ICO referring Facebook to the Irish authorities in its role in these sorts of things, so I think there is a big Rob Horne in the way in which personal data is being used, as a private commodity. This is information on people's wants, needs, desires and fears, used by private corporations to attempt to manipulate them in the regulation simply has not kept pace. Yes... These are all really good points and you're absolutely correct that going forward the law has to be changed around electoral law, the use of data, in campaigns, and this is what this incredible investigation by the ICO is showing, but it is not enough, just look forward. We know that multiple crimes were committed during the EU referendum and we nor other multiple crimes have been alleged and are being investigated. Let's pick up on that because you see multiple crimes. We have spoken about Leave.EU and they been fined and that has been detailed. And we haven't mentioned the investigation by the Metropolitan Police entered Leave you. We will move onto the official campaign covered in this report, also in some detail.

Technology galloping ahead of the regulatory frameworks, and I think the public take this easily and politicians have two tickets easily. What does that mean? -- take this seriously. It means asking questions about whether the regulations are good enough. This discussion we are having is about specific investigations, and I think it is really important we let them take their course, and we allow those regulators to do their jobs. But, in terms of the future, we know I think that the regulations around elections are probably not what they should be, and I think we are all going to have to work actually on a pretty cross-party basis to get it right for the future. Are you shocked by the revelations? Of course I am. Going forward, the way in which data is managed is going to be a critical thing for any election process, and we always pride ourselves in the UK that is fair and honest and it does not appear to be at first examination, so I would say it is concerning, it is right it is pursued by the officials, as we've heard, and more importantly it is right there are regulations that everyone respects going forward.

The idea of it being a witchhunt is just a way of smearing the very serious investigations by our regulators and journalists who have been working on this for a long time. Liam? I am not here to defend Arron Banks. </p><p>It does strike me that the discussion last weekend... I have quite a lot of experience in international business, it didn't strike me as unusual you would use a holding company in another jurisdiction, so I don't think... You're referring to Arron Banks being asked about the source of his #8 million donation. I don't think those allegations quite stuck, but I do think these ones, at first reading, and I'm just absorbing the report as all of us are, they do seem more concerning, particularly if the fine has already been levied in there seems to be a clear breach. I guess if Leave.EU were here, they would probably say that there has also been lots of allegations on the other side... And we will come to those. For instance, the Lib Dems apparently sold some of their political data to Britain Stronger In Europe. I think in general most of the country wants us to get on with this process and we are completely bogged down in how the referendum was actually conducted... I will just ask. How big a deal do you think this is, because if you listen to what Carol has said, and you listen to Liam saying the people would just like to get on with the referendum, the sort of summary, if you like, from the report from the Information Commissioner says they discovered a disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy, and they found that not just with Leave.EU, but questions to answer from the official Leave campaign and also on the Remain side. We match I think the public is starting to ask serious questions about data, and especially new technology like this would -- I think the public are starting to ask. Technology galloping ahead of the regulatory frameworks, and I think the public take this easily and politicians have two tickets easily. What does that mean? -- take this seriously. It means asking questions about whether the regulations are good enough. This discussion we are having is about specific investigations, and I think it is really important we let them take their course, and we allow those regulators to do their jobs. But, in terms of the future, we know I think that the regulations around elections are probably not what they should be, and I think we are all going to have to work actually on a pretty cross-party basis to get it right for the future. Are you shocked by the revelations? Of course I am.

I think select committees are proving their worth in the House of Commons at the moment. I hope this demonstrates to people that actually there are functions in Parliament that can work well, and we can shift use them off. Grace, where are you on this? I think it is an exam of a more general trend we are seeing, increasingly, the use of Private -- personal data for private profit, and this is a trend that was across as you have said the big tech companies, and we have also seen recently the ICO referring Facebook to the Irish authorities in its role in these sorts of things, so I think there is a big Rob Horne in the way in which personal data is being used, as a private commodity.

The bigger problem in many cases, you've got very misleading information that you got completely wrong information. But sometimes some of the one-sided information, and we have this discussion quite a lot, why does it appear that I am saying something and he is saying something completely different? It is because he will take one side of how he wants to present the facts. That is played out on the Internet a lot and played out... I would be the first to agree that probably the main problem is partial and biased views. But we have to, as a society, keep a grip on what is the difference between true and false and if we can't do that, democracy itself is under threat. I furiously agree.

My fear is that the politicians aren't yet in a position to make that regulation. Are you not in a position? I spent the last 15 years working in tech, including bleeding edge tech. I do understand the algorithms, I understand the paradigms shift. With all the data that we have licensed people... We haven't understood the contracts we have entered into with the data we have given up about ourselves. On top of that will be deep machine learning, another paradigms shift, in terms of how that is being used to feedback to us what they want to feedback to us. You said 2% of fake news. You said three quarters of fake news. The reality is, the question is, what is the definition of fake news? Whose definition of -- is it? Is a one-sided news? The bigger problem in many cases, you've got very misleading information that you got completely wrong information. But sometimes some of the one-sided information, and we have this discussion quite a lot, why does it appear that I am saying something and he is saying something completely different? It is because he will take one side of how he wants to present the facts. That is played out on the Internet a lot and played out... I would be the first to agree that probably the main problem is partial and biased views. But we have to, as a society, keep a grip on what is the difference between true and false and if we can't do that, democracy itself is under threat. I furiously agree. That's it. Goodbye. Please come in. For the first time in a generation, BBC Two spent 12 extraordinary months... This is off the record? ..with the people looking out for Britain in these unpredictable times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCTWO-422e5b498dcf41fc8e6a77ca42901eb1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCTWO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TN9-N4Y1-JBH6-C09Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402047</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

The poll, which was first reported by Vox[1], asked the opinions of 1,280 potential voters. </p><p>Overall, YouGov found that seven out of ten people were in favor of breaking up Big Tech companies.63 percent of Democrats also were in favor of breaking up Big Tech. 66 percent of those who identified as independent voters supported a policy that broke up Big Tech companies and undid recent mergers. All three demographics agreed that there should be more competition in the tech field.67 percent of Republicans agreed that Big Tech companies like Google and Amazon should be broken up in order to ensure that these companies do not prioritize paid content. 68 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of independent voters also agreed.In a more detailed breakdown of those polled, 61 percent of conservatives and 69 percent of very conservative voters were in favor of breaking up the tech companies. Conservatives are concerned about having their voices and ideas snuffed out by the ideological echo chamber at platforms like Facebook and Google. President Trump[2] has expressed interest in breaking up Big Tech because they have not treated him or his followers very fairly. 74 percent of very liberal voters, 73 percent of moderately liberal voters, and 53 percent of independent voters wanted Big Tech companies broken up for antitrust violations. Democrats running for president have also picked up the torch calling for Big Tech companies to be broken up, mostly because of the privacy and data scandals that have plagued Facebook and Google. Senator Elizabeth Warren[3] has incorporated a breakup of Big Tech in her campaign promises.

All three demographics agreed that there should be more competition in the tech field. 67 percent of Republicans agreed that Big Tech companies like Google and Amazon should be broken up in order to ensure that these companies do not prioritize paid content. 68 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of independent voters also agreed. In a more detailed breakdown of those polled, 61 percent of conservatives and 69 percent of very conservative voters were in favor of breaking up the tech companies. Conservatives are concerned about having their voices and ideas snuffed out by the ideological echo chamber at platforms like Facebook and Google. President Trump[2] has expressed interest in breaking up Big Tech because they have not treated him or his followers very fairly. 74 percent of very liberal voters, 73 percent of moderately liberal voters, and 53 percent of independent voters wanted Big Tech companies broken up for antitrust violations. Democrats running for president have also picked up the torch calling for Big Tech companies to be broken up, mostly because of the privacy and data scandals that have plagued Facebook and Google. Senator Elizabeth Warren[3] has incorporated a breakup of Big Tech in her campaign promises. Corinne Weaver[4] is a staff writer for MRC TechWatch and she works as a senior analyst for the Media Research Center at the NewsBusters[5] site. As the Joe and Betty Anderlik Fellow, her coverage on tech censorship, media bias, and pro-life issues have been cited by many in the conservative movement.

A majority of those polled said that they felt tech companies were harming both democracy and free speech. </p><p>Republicans weren't alone in their concern: independents and Democrats had also lost faith in tech companies. Overall, 57% of those polled felt that social media was destroying democracy and free speech, while only 40% still retained faith in those companies.Trust in tech companies dropped significantly from November 2017. As of November 2018, only 30% of Republicans, 39% of independents, and 50% of Democrats trust that social media has the safety democracy and free speech in mind. According to Axios, there has been a 15 point spike in the number of people who worry that the government won't regulate big tech. There has been a 14 point increase in general distrust towards these platforms.Much of this could be attributed to the YouTube terrorist[2] video scandal, which showed how easy it was for actual criminals and terrorists to use big tech toward their ends. Censorship among big tech has also become part of the national conversation, from President Trump's political ad being taken down on Facebook to NRA gun pages being banned on YouTube. Even though in all the congressional hearings, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and YouTube have all denied any censorship, their actions speak louder than their words. Conservative content is not welcome on these platforms.New regulations on hate speech, the outcry from conservative employees at Google and Facebook, as well as a lack of transparency when it comes to taking content down is taking its toll among social media users in the United States. 67%[3] of Republicans have said that Google Search is biased against them. 49%[4] of conservatives don't trust Twitter, and 66%[5] of conservatives don't trust Twitter.

A majority of those polled said that they felt tech companies were harming both democracy and free speech. </p><p>Republicans weren't alone in their concern: independents and Democrats had also lost faith in tech companies. Overall, 57% of those polled felt that social media was destroying democracy and free speech, while only 40% still retained faith in those companies.Trust in tech companies dropped significantly from November 2017. As of November 2018, only 30% of Republicans, 39% of independents, and 50% of Democrats trust that social media has the safety democracy and free speech in mind. According to Axios, there has been a 15 point spike in the number of people who worry that the government won't regulate big tech. There has been a 14 point increase in general distrust towards these platforms.Much of this could be attributed to the YouTube terrorist[2] video scandal, which showed how easy it was for actual criminals and terrorists to use big tech toward their ends. Censorship among big tech has also become part of the national conversation, from President Trump's political ad being taken down on Facebook to NRA gun pages being banned on YouTube. Even though in all the congressional hearings, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and YouTube have all denied any censorship, their actions speak louder than their words. Conservative content is not welcome on these platforms.New regulations on hate speech, the outcry from conservative employees at Google and Facebook, as well as a lack of transparency when it comes to taking content down is taking its toll among social media users in the United States. 67%[3] of Republicans have said that Google Search is biased against them. 49%[4] of conservatives don't trust Twitter, and 66%[5] of conservatives don't trust Twitter.

Kevin Thomas (D-Nassau County), who heads the Senate Consumer Protection, Internet and Technology Committee.</p><p>Kaiser first came forward with information about Cambridge Analytica's shady business practices last year after another whistleblower went public about the company's data harvesting.</p><p>Since then she has written a book and spent her time issuing warnings about data collection, whether it be private financial information being sold by credit rating agencies to data dealers, or social media and political consulting firms targeting customers with misleading or flatout inaccurate information.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we've seen that if companies are left alone they are not making the ethical decision, so now it's in the hands of lawmakers and regulators to make sure companies are protecting their consumers,\" Kaiser told the Daily News.</p><p>Thomas said hearing from the whistleblower directly should be a real eye-opener for his colleagues and others.</p><p>\"She worked on projects where Facebook had been used to manipulate whole populations for elections and she knows how harmful such a tool is and what Facebook executives are doing to try not to change how Facebook operates, and that itself is why we need to have state regulations,\" he said.</p><p>Thomas said legislation he sponsored this year and will reintroduce in 2020 seeks to require companies to better inform consumers about what personal information is being collected, how it's being used and to whom it is being sold. The New York Privacy Act faced stiff opposition from lobbyists and tech companies during the last legislative session and has been compared with the groundbreaking California Consumer Privacy Act enacted last year.</p><p>The bill focuses on transparency and control and would allow people to find out what data companies are collecting on them, see who that information is sold to or shared with, request that it be deleted or not be disseminated at all.</p><p>It would also require businesses to act as \"data fiduciaries,\" which would legally bar businesses from using data in a way that would benefit their companies and harm users.</p><p>\"Given how much information these data companies have about us, I am telling them now they have a duty of loyalty to the consumer, and they have to balance it with their duty to their shareholders,\" Thomas said. \"They cannot always put profit over people. They have to look at what is best for the consumer.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYNWS-NY0105933833</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJK-VSK1-JBM5-R1Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily News, L.P.

Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) introduced the \"21st Century Antitrust Act,\" a bill targeting big tech that would enable the state to take enforcement and legal action against companies engaging in uncompetitive practices such as predatory pricing or leveraging a company's position to control adjacent markets.</p><p>\"Our anti-trust laws were written a century ago for a radically different economy and they are in desperate need of serious updates,\" said Gianaris (inset), a key player in Amazon's decision to pull out of a proposed Queens headquarters. \"Corporate power has reached unprecedented and dangerous levels, and we need powerful new laws to protect the public and our economy.\"</p><p>Under current state law, anti-trust laws require two parties to conspire to manipulate the economy before enforcement actions can occur. Gianaris' bill would more closely mirror Europe's stricter standards for monopolies and bad corporate behavior and allow class-action anti-trust lawsuits.</p><p>The Senate's consumer protection committee and chairman Sen. Kevin Thomas (D-Nassau) will lead the hearing as lawmakers look to figure out whether the companies have used questionable business practices to bully or elbow smaller competitors out of the market and maintain unfair monopolies.</p><p>\"Investigating this issue is crucial in ensuring that our economy remains competitive, innovation continues to thrive, and consumers are protected,\" Thomas said.</p><p>The bill and hearing come in the wake of CEOs from Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook being grilled by Congress earlier this summer about business practices and whether their companies have violated federal anti-trust regulations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYNWS-NY0112084486</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RS-NJP1-DY37-F1PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"328\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Daily News, L.P.

Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>Love him or hate him, you have to admit President Trump makes an impression wherever he goes. The President is right now wrapping up a busy first day in London after a Monday filled with ceremony and celebration. He has been exchanging pleasantries with some of England's elite and counterpunching with others.</p><p>We start off tonight with chief White House Correspondent, John Roberts, who's traveling with the President. Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening to you.</p><p>And the President did just wrap up his day as the motorcade left Buckingham Palace just a short time ago. President Trump is a controversial figure in the U.K. to be sure. But while politicians here squabbled over whether this state visit should have happened at all, Elizabeth proved once again it's good to be Queen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEEN ELIZABETH II, UNITED KINGDOM: As we look to the future, I'm confident that our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: On behalf of all Americans, I offer a toast to the eternal friendship of our people.</p><p>ROBERTS: A lavish state capping off a day of pomp, ceremony, and controversy as Queen Elizabeth welcomed President Trump and the First Lady to the U.K. for what is just her third state visit of an American president.</p><p>At Buckingham Palace, the President reviewed the honor guard as they played American military songs. Then lunched with the Queen and other members of the royal family. Also present was Prince Harry, whose bride, American actress Meghan Markle, has been highly critical of the President.</p><p>In an interview with \"The Sun\" newspaper, President Trump said \"I didn't know that, what can I say, I didn't know she was nasty.\" As that quote raced around the world, President Trump took to Twitter to insist \"I never called Meghan Markle nasty.\" An audio recording shows he did say it but the President goes on to say I'm sure she will do excellently. Markle did not attend today's ceremonies, citing maternity leave.</p><p>President Trump did have some choice words for London Mayor Sadiq Khan after Khan wrote an op-ed criticizing President Trump as a figure head for a growing ultra-right movement. Khan wrote, \"In years to come, I suspect this state visit will be one we look back on with profound regret and acknowledge that we were on the wrong side of history.\"</p><p>MAYOR SADIQ KHAN, LONDON, ENGLAND: Some of the things Donald Trump has done over the last two, three years -- Londoners find it abhorrent and offensive.</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump took a blow torch to Khan, tweeting \"He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\"</p><p>The President also got into a spat with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn who boycotted tonight's state dinner. U.K. foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said Corbyn's actions were out-of-bounds.</p><p>JEREMY HUNT, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: What is really inappropriate is for anyone to boycott a visit by the President of the United States. He's being hosted by Her Majesty, the Queen to mark the great friendship between our two countries.</p><p>ROBERTS: With the royal ceremonies wrapped up, President Trump will tomorrow meet for the last time with outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May. In an interview with the Sunday times, the President urged whoever takes over to do a no-deal Brexit by the end of October and sign a free trade agreement with the United States.</p><p>TRUMP: If they want to do trade with the United States. And I think there's an opportunity for a very big trade deal at some point in the near future.</p><p>ROBERTS: But President Trump raised some eyebrows here, saying he would like former foreign secretary Boris Johnson to be that prime minister.</p><p>TRUMP: He has been a friend of mine. He's been very nice. I have a very good relationship with him.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: In testing the ties that bind together the United States and the U.K., both the Queen and the President leaned heavily on the shared commitment and sacrifice that the allied countries showed on D-Day 75 years ago Thursday.</p><p>In ceremonies on Wednesday and Thursday, the President will commemorate that anniversary first here in England in the point at which the troops disembarked and then on Thursday on the shores of Normandy, where they landed -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: John Roberts -- just after 11:00 p.m. London time. John -- thanks.</p><p>Let's talk about the President's trip and what's happening here in Washington. Senior political analyst Brit Hume joins us tonight.</p><p>Good evening -- Brit.</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hi -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: You know, your thoughts about this. All this uproar, and obviously the pomp and circumstance of the moment.</p><p>HUME: Well, you know, these state visits involving these two countries really aren't about the personalities presiding at time. They really are about this relationship with this country that has been so close to us for so long, really since the American Revolution.</p><p>And we have stood together through thick and thin, and triumphantly through the dark days and then the victory in World War II and that's part of what's going to be commemorative this week, as it should be. And that's what the ceremony really is about.</p><p>Donald Trump may not be -- I doubt very seriously if Donald Trump is the favorite of the Queen but she spoke as she did about him and welcomed him for the same reason that he spoke about her in the way he did.</p><p>The relationship is bigger than any of this stuff between the politicians and you can see in the actions of the mayor of London whose popularity is down in a city which isn't particularly fond of Trump. So he takes Trump on and of course, Trump bites and bites back. Similarly with Jeremy Corbyn. So, you know, politicians do what politicians do but this relationship goes on.</p><p>BAIER: Yes. And the President is a counterpuncher, as we have said.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BAIER: But you know, that The Brexit vote that was a preamble almost to the Donald Trump vote --</p><p>HUME: Right.</p><p>BAIER: -- would that spoke to something else was happening, this populism.</p><p>HUME: Right. Yes. There is an uprising that transcends, you know, our country and theirs. It's happening in a lot of places. And Donald Trump is certainly a result of that. And to some extent, perhaps the cause but more of a result. And so you see the strain that that cause as reflected but I think strikingly -- set aside by the people that mattered for the purposes of this visit, and that's a good thing.</p><p>BAIER: They are talking about trade and the possibility of direct trade between the U.S. and the U.K. Meantime, we have this Mexico situation and the possibility of tariffs if Mexico according to the President doesn't deal with the illegal immigration situation.</p><p>Here is outgoing Kevin Hassett as the White House talking about that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: The President is you know, very good at getting people to the table and getting, you know, concessions. Mexico is coming, right. So they could've come to last week or two weeks ago but now they're coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: You could read between there that it's not exactly the best economics in his answer. But perhaps --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BAIER: He is getting --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>HUME: Yes. Kevin Hassett is the most cheerful man, by the way, probably in the world. Clearly he's not -- I don't think he is a big fan of tariffs. And tariffs seem to have now emerged as a weapon of choice for the President for all causes. For economic reasons and now for border control reasons.</p><p>The consequences of that is the fat's in the fire. The fat's in the fire with China. The fat's in the fire now with Mexico. The fat's in the fire in his -- not because of tariffs -- but in his dealings with North Korea.</p><p>So the President has a lot going -- a lot of pots on the stove and all of them may come up just fine.

We'll get reaction from all of that with the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll be going to the U.K. I think it will be very important. It certainly will be very interesting.</p><p>JEREMY HUNT, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: This is a state visit. This is not a political visit. He's being hosted by her majesty the queen to mark the great friendship between our two countries.</p><p>SADIQ KHAN, LONDON MAYOR: The thing about a best friend is, of course you stand shoulder to shoulder with them in times of adversity. But you've got to call them out when you think they're wrong. I don't think we should be rolling out the red carpet. I don't think this should be a state visit.</p><p>TRUMP: I don't think much of him. I think that he's the twin of the de Blasio except shorter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: President Donald Trump in Great Britain talking in the back-and- forth of Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who wrote an op-ed in \"The Guardian\" saying that the U.K. should not be welcoming the president of the United States, which is quite something. Before landing the president tweeted \"Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as mayor of London, who has been foolishly nasty to the president of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser should focus on crime in London, not me.\"</p><p>Despite that back-and-forth, a lot of the focus today, the pomp and circumstance all seemed to go well with the state dinner there in London. Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" Matthew, obviously a lot of focus on the promised protest, even though we haven't seen much of that as of yet. There will be a lot of focus on the balloon that is supposed to fly over London. But today was about the relationship ahead of the 75th anniversary of D-Day. That was kind of an interesting image.</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": I think the first thing to say, this is going to make a very interesting season of \"The Crown.\" I don't know when we can anticipate that. Maybe a few years from now.</p><p>The second thing is, there's the pomp and circumstance, which is important, but then there's the substance facing the Trump administration in its relationship with the United Kingdom. And there are several issues that need to be worked out, from Brexit to a trade deal to the British government's cooperation with Huawei, the tech giant that we are fighting, the Chinese-backed enterprise. All of these things depend, though, on the replacement of Theresa May as prime minister, and until that is resolved, none of the other issues I think can actually be attended to.</p><p>BAIER: Mollie?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I think also one of the other issues that there's this big subtext here is this global issue of rising nationalism and populism versus elite control. Great Britain is having such issues here where you actually had people vote to exit the European Union, and people just trying to refused to do what the people want.</p><p>Donald Trump represents this global movement. As you see those tensions coming in the play, and so I'm not surprised to see some of the people who represent the people who don't want to respond or who are the people who don't want to respond to the will of the people not reacting so well to him.</p><p>BAIER: Here is Boris Johnson, rather, Sadiq Khan and President Trump talking about Boris Johnson, possibly a replacement for Theresa May.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SADIQ KHAN, LONDON MAYOR: I spent my first three years as mayor spending too much time cleaning up his mess. The idea that Boris Johnson's record as mayor is an application for the job of being prime minister I find astonishing.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I like him. I've always liked him. I don't know that he's going to be chosen, but I think he's a very good guy, a very talented person. I could help anybody by endorsing them. We have had endorsements where they've gone up from 40, 50 points at a shot. That's here, but I understand over there that it would be a great endorsement. Other people have asked me for an endorsement, too. I've been asked for endorsements.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Obviously he's asked all of these questions, and sometimes they create a firestorm, but he's asked the questions. And it's ahead of the meeting with Theresa May.</p><p>MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, it's ahead of the meeting with Theresa May. He chose to respond to the mayor of London. He's really punching down. I think that that was a fight that he chose to engage in. But Donald Trump believes if you're not fighting, you're losing. So yes, he has this meeting with Theresa May, which apparently is not an extended bilateral. It's going to be quite short. But as Matthew said, they have a lot of really important issues.</p><p>BAIER: Her time in office is --</p><p>LIASSON: Her time in office is short, but they still need to talk about some of these other issues. And now Trump, once again, and he's done this before when he's gone to England, gotten involved in internal English politics.</p><p>BAIER: I want to turn now to Jared Kushner who gave an interview with \"Axios\" that aired over the weekend. This is the part about the meeting, the Russian meeting at Trump Tower and the fallout from it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": We are talking about Russia here. They are a longtime adversary of the United States, decades of hostility, including spying. Does it not set off at least some alarm bell when you see an email saying that the Russian government wants to help?</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER: Like I said, the email that I got on my iPhone at the time because said show up at 4:00. I didn't scroll down. I never would've thought about that.</p><p>SWAN: It had \"Russia\" in the subject line.</p><p>KUSHNER: Again, I would get about 250 emails a day. And so I literally say show up at 4:00. I showed up at 4:00.</p><p>SWAN: Would you call the FBI if it happened again?</p><p>KUSHNER: I don't know. It's hard to do hypotheticals, but the reality is is that we were not given anything that was salacious.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Matthew?</p><p>CONTINETTI: I think Kushner has made a lot of his influence known in the administration working behind the scenes on two plans. One is the Middle East peace plan, and the other is the immigration plan. Both of those plans are running into trouble because of event that are outside of his control. This interview, on the other hand, was largely within his control. And I think he left a lot of questions unanswered as a result.</p><p>BAIER: Mollie?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I would love to say, though, this interview is a great example of how bad our media are at covering the present moment. To be asked a question about Russia when we just came through two years of this Russia hoax conspiracy theory, and you have questions about whether you should've taken a meeting or whatnot. To actually have --</p><p>BAIER: The question, hold on, hold on.</p><p>LIASSON: -- it was not a hoax at all.</p><p>BAIER: Timeout. The question was, would you call the FBI if it happened again. Robert Mueller did say there was the threat that Russia is going to do it again. I understand what you're saying. Hold on. Let me just say that the question was about would you call the FBI.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Sure, but the point being you actually have the FBI, which is implicated in perpetuating this hoax. You don't have the media asking tough questions about that. You don't have the media asking tough questions about the campaign that actually did work with Russians to meddle in our elections by putting together this dossier which they claim was sourced to Russian government officials, and to still be living in this conspiracy theory is just absurd.</p><p>And so I'm not saying he answered the question particularly well, but this is just -- at some point, the media are going to have to deal with the fact that this Russia collusion conspiracy theory was debunked, and not a single American was indicted for treasonous collusion with Russia, and that nothing has been dealt with in terms of Hillary Clinton's meddling with secretly hiring people to --</p><p>BAIER: When do you think that moment is going to happen, the I.G. report, the other reports, Bill Barr, where do you think it's going to happen?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: It just seems that no matter what comes out, the media are working very hard to avoid dealing with the reality of what happened.</p><p>BAIER: You don't think it was a fair question to ask Jared Kushner whether he would call the FBI if it happened again?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: It's fine. But that one question versus the hundreds of questions we have about what happened at the FBI, what happened at the Department of Justice --</p><p>BAIER: OK, but he is not the guy to answer that question.</p><p>LIASSON: -- talked about any of those things.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: These are questions all media people can ask all people.</p><p>BAIER: And Jared could have answered anyway he wanted to. He didn't.</p><p>Last word?</p><p>LIASSON: I think this was a mistake for him to have given this interview, I really do. And we could've played some other clips that also didn't reflect that well on him.</p><p>BAIER: All right, next up, the 2020 Democrats take aim at Joe Biden.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D-VT) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is a debate among presidential candidates who have spoken to you here in this room, and those who have chosen for whatever reason not to be in this room.</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D-IN) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In these times Democrats can no more keep a promise to take us back to the 2000s or the 1990s, than conservatives can keep a promise to take us back to the 1950s. We can only look forward.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Some Democrats in Washington believe the only changes we can get are tweaks and nudges. Our country is in a time of crisis. The time for small ideas is over.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Remember in Harry Potter where they couldn't say \"Voldemort\"? It was kind of like that. They couldn't say \"Biden,\" but they were talking about Joe Biden, as you see in this California Democratic Convention. Now you look the average of recent poll, the Real Clear Politics average, Joe Biden, as you see, has a big lead. It's hard to read all of these names because there's so many of them, but there you have the breakdown.</p><p>But here's the early states, and this is important, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, also Biden with leads. Obviously, Iowa the closest there. And we're back with the panel. It seems like as we get closer and closer to this first debate, Mara, that there's going to be more swinging at Joe Biden.</p><p>LIASSON: More swinging. I think the biggest imperative for everybody on that stage is just to stand out and to say look at me. But Joe Biden didn't have to be at the Democratic Convention because you just showed the math. But I do think, I am hearing from Democrats that one thing he does need to do before the first debate is come out with some big, bold policies. They don't have to be leftwing policies, but they have to be some policies, which he has resisted doing with the exception of an education speech, because he hasn't had to so far.</p><p>But being a frontrunner in the Democratic primary is historically very precarious. And I think he needs to give people a reason to be excited about him, not just to think he's electable.</p><p>BAIER: As evidence, and probably one of the reasons he didn't go to the Democratic Convention in California, John Delaney and John Hickenlooper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DELANEY, (D) PRESIDENT CANDIDATE: Medicare for all may sound good, but it's actually not good policy nor is it good politics. I'm telling you.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me be clear. If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big, progressive goals, socialism is not the answer. I was reelected.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Matthew?</p><p>CONTINETTI: In 2012 at the Democratic Convention, the crowd booed mentions of Jerusalem and God in the party platform. In 2019, they are booing denunciations of socialism. Give them a few months, they will be booing mom and apple pie. This is your Democratic Party at work.</p><p>BAIER: So obviously Biden doesn't want to go into that place.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I do think getting booed there is not necessarily the worst.</p><p>BAIER: It will probably be in an ad.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So it's a problem that the Democratic Party has that their base are getting further and further to the left whereas they need to appeal to moderate people. That's Biden's strength, of course. And he didn't need to be there, but I'm worried that once he makes policies that are more specific that there might be much more room to --</p><p>LIASSON: I'm interested in seeing that, and I bet he's going to do just fine without lurching to the left. But the thing about Hickenlooper that's so amazing, he's the guy who was asked in an interview not long ago, are you a capitalist, and he couldn't say that he was.</p><p>BAIER: He couldn't say.</p><p>LIASSON: And he's a former businessman. That's his whole brand.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: It's also interesting that you had all these candidates speaking about Medicare for all or getting booed for not supporting it. It really is stunning how quickly Obamacare has fallen into something that people don't think is defendable or --</p><p>LIASSON: It's the Twitter part of the Democratic Party and the California Democratic Party. Most Democrats, I think we could probably find some polling on it, are happy to have Obamacare and a public option.</p><p>BAIER: Here we go, the Kaiser poll, number two, where should Democrats focus their efforts on approving health care, improving and protecting Obamacare. You have a question. We have a poll for you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAIER: Matthew, where do you think it goes? Obviously, we have a long, long way to go before we get to anybody voting.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Biden's lead has been durable, but as you see in that poll that you showed of Iowa, that is a very precarious lead in the early states. I would say other than ganging up on Biden in the beginning, the other big story from this convention was Kamala Harris continues to underwhelm. She actually had the microphone stolen from her during one panel, and her response betrayed a candidate who was kind of uncertain and uninsured.</p><p>LIASSON: Some guy comes on stage, you should --</p><p>BAIER: Moveon.org, you can't fault her. But you can look at this poll in California where she is the sitting senator, and this is not good.</p><p>LIASSON: That's the interesting thing, not so much what she did when that animal rights guy came on the --</p><p>CONTINETTI: I'm telling you, it happened in 2016, and it shows something about the candidates, even if it's -- we don't know what we would do in the same thing, but can you see Donald Trump giving of the microphone voluntarily?</p><p>LIASSON: We've seen Donald Trump flinch on the stage when some guy rushed it. This is --</p><p>BAIER: I'm not sure what he would do. Five seconds.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Biden is strong, but the moment he shows some weakness, it could all collapse quickly.</p><p>LIASSON: Because his whole thing is about I can beat him.</p><p>BAIER: We've seen it before. When we come back, keeping heroism in the family.</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, it's all in the family. 101-year-old, Walter Kloc, traveled from New York to Colorado to commission his grandson, Joseph at his graduation from the Air Force Academy last week. Walter, a World War II veteran was an Air Force bombardier pilot. Joseph was commissioned as a second lieutenant and Walter received the standing ovation. Great stuff. We'll see a lot of that from D-Day this week. Big week when you think about World War II.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. Speaking of that, \"THE STORY\", hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now. She's heading over there.</p><p>Martha?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019060301cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-1851-DXH2-64D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Royalty</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009TA3</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TRZ</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009XG5</classCode><className>BRITISH MONARCHS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CVO6</classCode><className>BRITISH ROYALTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

The investigation found the Chinese government \u201cexerts control over China\u2019s domestic telecommunications industry and state-owned carriers\u201d while it \u201cengages in cyber and economic espionage efforts against the United States\" and \"may use telecommunications carriers operating in the United States to further these efforts.\" </p><p>Pompeo announced the Clean Path initiative in April, aimed at implementing the 5G Clean Path guidelines outlined in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, part of the U.S. effort to protect its fifth-generation wireless systems and other telecommunications from being compromised by Chinese Big Tech firms such as Huawei or by other foreign actors. \"The objective is that untrusted IT vendors will have no access to U.S. State Department systems\u201d and that \u201cwe will keep doing all we can to keep our critical data and our networks safe from the Chinese Communist Party,\" Pompeo said.</p><p>This week\u2019s announcement builds on that, as Pompeo said that Clean Carrier efforts will ensure that \u201cuntrusted\u201d Chinese carriers \u201care not connected\u201d to U.S. telecom networks due to concerns about national security; Clean Store requirements will aim to \u201cremove untrusted applications from U.S. mobile app stores\u201d because Chinese apps \u201cthreaten our privacy, proliferate viruses, and spread propaganda and disinformation\u201d; Cleans Apps guidelines will prevent \u201cuntrusted\u201d Chinese smartphone manufacturers from pre-installing or making available for download \u201ctrusted apps\u201d on their apps store so as to keep U.S. companies from promoting apps on phones produced by companies such as Huawei, which have been linked to human rights abuses; Clean Cloud efforts will protect personal data and intellectual property from being stored on cloud systems that are \u201caccessible to our foreign adversaries\u201d through Chinese tech firms such as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent; and Clean Cable rules will \u201censure the undersea cables connecting our country to the global internet are not subverted for intelligence gathering\u201d by China. </p><p>Pompeo also told reporters that he is joining Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf in \u201curging\u201d the Federal Communications Commission to \u201crevoke and terminate\u201d the authorizations of China Telecom and three other companies providing services to and from the U.S. </p><p>The announcement follows President Trump\u2019s comments on Monday that TikTok would \u201cclose down\u201d in the U.S. by Sept. 15 unless Microsoft or another U.S. company works out a deal approved by his administration to buy the video-sharing social media platform. TikTok is owned by Chinese internet technology company ByteDance, which is based in Beijing. </p><p>ByteDance and TikTok have repeatedly claimed that they have not and would never turn over TikTok user data to the Chinese government, but national security experts have raised concerns about China\u2019s own 2017 national intelligence law, which requires all Chinese companies to assist Chinese intelligence services when asked \u2014 and to keep it secret. </p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, said on Sunday that \u201cthe entire committee agrees that TikTok cannot stay in the current format because it risks sending back information on a hundred million Americans.\u201d </p><p>The House voted by a large margin to block federal employees from using TikTok in July, and the Senate joined them on Wednesday. The ban is expected to become law soon. Joe Biden's campaign told staff to delete TikTok from their phones. The Pentagon banned service members from using TikTok in late 2019, and the Transportation Security Administration, Department of Homeland Security, and State Department also banned TikTok on government devices. </p><p>Trump's April executive order established the \u201cCommittee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector\u201d after years of there being an informal Team Telecom. The order said the \u201csecurity, integrity, and availability\u201d of U.S. telecom networks was \u201cvital\u201d to U.S. national security. </p><p>Barr was named the formal head of Team Telecom, tasked with working with the FCC to ensure foreign foes do not gain undue access to or control over U.S. communications networks. </p><p>The Justice Department backed the FCC\u2019s successful plan late last year to block Chinese telecommunications companies such as Huawei and ZTE from receiving federal money to help build U.S. broadband infrastructure and supported the FCC\u2019s proposal to replace any broadband equipment already in place that uses the Chinese company's equipment. </p><p>The U.S. also charged Huawei in a global racketeering scheme earlier this year, and U.S. intelligence agencies believe Huawei, ZTE, and other Chinese companies are working hand in hand with the Chinese Communist Party. </p><p>Federal agencies in the U.S. were banned in August 2019 from purchasing telecommunications products, surveillance equipment, or any other products or services from Huawei, ZTE Corporation, and three other Chinese companies.

They point to evidence that Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube are staffed disproportionately by liberals, a fact that nobody seriously denies. In a fascinating essay for the New Atlantis, Adam White argues that there is a deep alignment between their corporate culture and the assumptions of modern liberalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A nearly inevitable result, conservatives say, is that the companies are more likely to try to suppress conservative content as offensive: taking down tweets and posts from righties and directing traffic elsewhere. The companies deny they have displayed bias, even as admit they have made occasional mistakes in content moderation.</p><p> One school of conservatives argues that while the tech titans' decisions may be wrong and worthy of condemnation, it is not government's business to regulate their decisions because they are private companies.</p><p> According to this reasoning, people who are unhappy with Facebook's policies should condemn or boycott it. They should cajole Twitter into adopting better policies. (One suggestion has been that Twitter act toward its users the same way the First Amendment makes the government act toward citizens.) Or they should try to start a rival site.</p><p> What these conservatives don't want is for government to force the companies to behave differently, beyond holding them to their own terms of service.</p><p> Another group on the right thinks that the hands-off approach is dogma unsuited to the world we actually inhabit. The social-media companies are too large a part of our society, and host too much of our political debate, for the government to leave them alone.</p><p> A leading voice for this second group is Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. His criticisms of social-media companies are wide-ranging. He has gone so far as to question whether the talent they employ would be doing more good in other parts of the economy.</p><p> Political bias is among his main concerns. \"Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,\" he has said. \"They should not be able to discriminate against conservatives. They should not be able to tell conservatives to sit down and shut up.\"</p><p> Soon after his election in 2018, Hawley argued that the big tech companies are benefiting from a government-granted privilege. He observed \u2014 on Twitter, naturally \u2014 that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives these companies immunity from liability for content that appears on their sites.</p><p> They get this immunity, he suggested, on the condition that they serve as forums for \"a true diversity of political discourse.\" He called for congressional investigations to see if they were meeting that condition. Congress has subsequently held hearings on it.</p><p> Republican Senator Ted Cruz, questioning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, made the same point as Hawley: \"The predicate for Section 230 immunity under the CDA is that you're a neutral public forum.\"</p><p> What they're saying: Facebook can be a message board with no responsibility for the messages tacked onto it. Or it can take an active role in shaping content, in which case it assumes legal responsibility for that content.</p><p> Those who fear government regulation in this area (and not just conservatives) have pushed back against Hawley and Cruz. They point out that the law also gives the companies immunity for actions they take against obscene, harassing or otherwise objectionable material, even if that material falls under the First Amendment.</p><p> It does not seem like too much for Congress to ask that the immunity it has provided be conditioned on some more transparency from the companies about how they decide what content to promote, hide or suppress. One possibility would be to require the companies to disclose summary information about how they make these decisions; another, perhaps easier to administer, would be to require them to publish a database of content they have deleted.</p><p> Before we decide either to regulate the tech companies or leave them alone, let's find out if the anecdotes of bias are just anecdotes, or something more.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-d8af7aeb6823b32577d0f792a8bbf8d01ecdb73a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E113A10985CF6 NWBKIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MWT1-DXVP-V06T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

They point to evidence that Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube are staffed disproportionately by liberals, a fact that nobody seriously denies. In a fascinating essay for the New Atlantis, Adam White argues that there is a deep alignment between their corporate culture and the assumptions of modern liberalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A nearly inevitable result, conservatives say, is that the companies are more likely to try to suppress conservative content as offensive: taking down tweets and posts from righties and directing traffic elsewhere. The companies deny they have displayed bias, even as admit they have made occasional mistakes in content moderation.</p><p> One school of conservatives argues that while the tech titans' decisions may be wrong and worthy of condemnation, it is not government's business to regulate their decisions because they are private companies.</p><p> According to this reasoning, people who are unhappy with Facebook's policies should condemn or boycott it. They should cajole Twitter into adopting better policies. (One suggestion has been that Twitter act toward its users the same way the First Amendment makes the government act toward citizens.) Or they should try to start a rival site.</p><p> What these conservatives don't want is for government to force the companies to behave differently, beyond holding them to their own terms of service.</p><p> Another group on the right thinks that the hands-off approach is dogma unsuited to the world we actually inhabit. The social-media companies are too large a part of our society, and host too much of our political debate, for the government to leave them alone.</p><p> A leading voice for this second group is Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. His criticisms of social-media companies are wide-ranging. He has gone so far as to question whether the talent they employ would be doing more good in other parts of the economy.</p><p> Political bias is among his main concerns. \"Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,\" he has said. \"They should not be able to discriminate against conservatives. They should not be able to tell conservatives to sit down and shut up.\"</p><p> Soon after his election in 2018, Hawley argued that the big tech companies are benefiting from a government-granted privilege. He observed \u2014 on Twitter, naturally \u2014 that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives these companies immunity from liability for content that appears on their sites.</p><p> They get this immunity, he suggested, on the condition that they serve as forums for \"a true diversity of political discourse.\" He called for congressional investigations to see if they were meeting that condition. Congress has subsequently held hearings on it.</p><p> Republican Senator Ted Cruz, questioning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, made the same point as Hawley: \"The predicate for Section 230 immunity under the CDA is that you're a neutral public forum.\"</p><p> What they're saying: Facebook can be a message board with no responsibility for the messages tacked onto it. Or it can take an active role in shaping content, in which case it assumes legal responsibility for that content.</p><p> Those who fear government regulation in this area (and not just conservatives) have pushed back against Hawley and Cruz. They point out that the law also gives the companies immunity for actions they take against obscene, harassing or otherwise objectionable material, even if that material falls under the First Amendment.</p><p> It does not seem like too much for Congress to ask that the immunity it has provided be conditioned on some more transparency from the companies about how they decide what content to promote, hide or suppress. One possibility would be to require the companies to disclose summary information about how they make these decisions; another, perhaps easier to administer, would be to require them to publish a database of content they have deleted.</p><p> Before we decide either to regulate the tech companies or leave them alone, let's find out if the anecdotes of bias are just anecdotes, or something more.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-56166a480558e8e45bdc7b94a6abae401af1d1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D5FB3B967499 NWBKIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MWT1-DXVP-V1P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Journal Gazette and Times-Courier<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

(Vatican Media)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pope Francis has called on big internet companies to do more to protect children from abuse and online pornography at a Vatican conference hosted by the UAE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his address to the Congress on Promoting Digital Child Dignity, the 82-year-old said he was not persuaded by arguments, put forward by some large online firms, that they offered only 'platforms' for sharing content and were therefore not responsible for how they are used.</p><p>He also said there is a need to find a \"fitting balance\" between freedom of expression online and the interests of society, to ensure that digital media channels \"are not used to perpetrate criminal activities against minors.\"</p><p>The event was addressed by Sheikh Saif bin Zayed, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, who said the exploitation and abuse of children had become \"a particular source of concern for the future of humanity\".</p><p>Although Pope Francis did not mention any company by name, the summit was attended by representatives of firms including Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google.</p><p>While acknowledging that the internet had brought opportunities for young people, for example in education, he said that security agencies were struggling to keep up with the sharing of child abuse online.</p><p>He also raised concerns of long-term damage to children as a result of being exposed to online pornography at a young age.</p><p>\"Reliable studies tell us that the average age of first access to pornography is currently eleven, and tends to keep lowering,\" the Catholic leader said. \"This is in no way acceptable.</p><p>\"The majority of scientific studies have highlighted the profound impact of pornography on the thinking and behaviour of children.</p><p>\"It will surely have lifelong effects on them, in the form of grave addiction, violent behaviour and deeply troubled emotional and sexual relationships.\"</p><p>In comments targeted at big digital media companies, he said: \"It is now clear that they cannot consider themselves completely unaccountable vis-\u00e0-vis the services they provide for their customers.</p><p>\"So I make an urgent appeal to them to assume their responsibility towards minors, their integrity and their future. It will not be possible to guarantee the safety of minors in the digital world without the full involvement of companies in this sector and without a full awareness of the moral and social repercussions of their management and functioning.</p><p>\"Such companies are bound not only to respect the law, but also to be concerned with the direction taken by the technological and social developments which they produce and promote, since such developments are far ahead of the laws that would seek to regulate them.\"</p><p>The summit is the latest in a series of events, backed by the UAE, aimed at addressing the issue of child safety in the digital age. A major summit was held in Abu Dhabi last year about the problem, following the Child Dignity in the Digital World congress, held in Rome in October 2017.</p><p>In his comments on Thursday, Pope Francis praised positive measures taken by some governments, such as requiring internet providers to implement age-verification checks. However, he said far more needed to be done by companies.</p><p>\"There is a need to ensure that investors and managers remain accountable, so that the good of minors and society is not sacrificed to profit,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have seen how society has grown more sensitive to the areas of environmental care and respect for the dignity of labour.</p><p>\"A similar concern for the effective protection of minors and the fight against pornography should become increasingly felt in the finance and the economy of the digital world. The safe and sound growth of our young is a noble goal worth pursuing; it has far greater value than mere economic profit gained at the risk of harming young people.\"</p><p>The Pope's appearance at the summit jointly hosted by the UAE follows his historic visit to Abu Dhabi earlier this year.</p><p>Sheikh Saif made reference the visit in his remarks. The interfaith conference was also attended by Dr Ahmad Al Tayyeb, Grand Imam of Al Azhar Al Sharif.</p><p>\"The people of the UAE welcomed His Holiness Pope Francis with joy and happiness last February during his landmark historical visit to the UAE, the first to the region, to an Arab and Muslim country that diligently endeavours to foster peaceful coexistence, and spread tolerance and love,\" Sheikh Saif said.</p><p>\"What unites us as believers is far greater than what divides us. All religious denominations around the world condemn evil and call for cooperation, good deeds and respect for life.\"</p><p>During his trip Sheikh Saif met Queen Silvia of Sweden, a long-time activist for children's rights, and the Italian interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese.</p><p>Reem Abdullah Al Falasi, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood, also addressed the Vatican conference.</p><p>\"We still need greater international efforts to protect the world's children,\" she said. \"New challenges and threats to the rights of the world's children have emerged, and the need for protection in the digital world is one of the most prominent of these threats and perhaps the most difficult to deal with, because, in the digital world, risks and abuses are hidden from the public.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/65/157381949792.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/65/157381949792.jpg</url></p><p>Pope Francis meeting participants in the international congress on \"Promoting Digital Child Dignity \".

The founder and chief executive of PopSockets, a local company that makes a widely popular kickstand of sorts for smartphones, says he isn't even an \"expert on antitrust laws\" in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Barnett discovered firsthand the rare power and influence of Amazon in 2018, after clashing with the e-commerce giant over policies that made it hard to sell his products on his preferred terms and prices. PopSockets soon terminated its ties with Amazon, which helped lead to sizable losses later as a result.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"What company that started a business out of their garage can afford to lose $10 million?\" he asked in an interview. \"We're lucky we're in a position we're profitable and could take a stand.\"</p><p>Barnett's story could resonate with federal regulators: Such tales of Big Tech's debatably brash, bullying tactics are set to take center stage when he and his corporate peers testify at a high-profile congressional hearing here Friday. The session could elicit the most convincing public evidence to date that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google have become too big and powerful - and need to be restrained.</p><p>Since June, House lawmakers led by Democratic Rep. David N. Cicilline (R.I.) have trained their sights on the four tech giants, exploring their ascendancy as the world's most popular and profitable online services. Even in a capital wracked by partisanship, Democrats and Republicans have come to share heightened concerns the industry's biggest players may have stifled competition, enriched themselves on Americans' personal data or locked in their digital dominance unlawfully.</p><p>The hearing - to be held not far from PopSockets' headquarters in Boulder - could ultimately serve to put a new, personal face on long-standing calls for tech titans to be regulated, penalized or broken up, galvanizing those who believe Congress needs to toughen federal antitrust laws to prevent abuse.</p><p>\"You think about the market share that some of these platforms have,\" Cicilline said. \"You change an algorithm, you exclude someone from a platform, and you can put them out of business.\"</p><p>Along with PopSockets, lawmakers are set to hear from top executives at Sonos, a high-end audio company, and Basecamp, which makes collaborative workplace software. Both allege Google undermines smaller rivals. Sonos has sued Google, alleging patent infringement.</p><p>Joining those witnesses will be a senior official from Tile, best known for its technology that helps people track keys, wallets and other objects they're liable to lose around the house. Company officials contend Apple's software tweaks stifle competing services.</p><p>Ahead of the hearing, tech giants vigorously defended their practices. Amazon in a statement said its seller rules benefit consumers, and it took issue with PopSockets and some of its claims. Google said its ad policies are fair and it never infringed on Sonos technology. Apple pointed to past comments saying it seeks to protect consumer privacy through its software updates, not undermine rivals. Facebook did not comment.</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The bipartisan congressional inquiry illustrates the precarious regulatory environment that looms over Silicon Valley, once the darling of a tech-obsessed Washington. The industry's rapid rise and record-breaking profits, long heralded as an engine of American economic growth, now are seen as evidence of the dangers of corporate consolidation.</p><p>In response, federal antitrust regulators have started to ponder action: The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission last year divvied up competition oversight of the country's top tech companies. Nearly every state attorney general, meanwhile, has banded together for wide-ranging probes targeting Facebook and Google. On Thursday, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser announced he had appointed three experienced lawyers to help with antitrust issues and investigations.</p><p>And Cicilline, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust-focused subcommittee, has spent seven months leading the panel as it peers under the hood of Big Tech.</p><p>So far, members of Congress have obtained millions of documents with the goal of putting forward bipartisan recommendations in the next few months. Cicilline said this week lawmakers soon also seek to question \"the CEOs of some of the major technology companies,\" threatening an uncomfortable public grilling for Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>The tech industry's top lobbyists say they understand the scrutiny. But they disagree vehemently with those who say that consumers have suffered and tech companies should be broken up as a result.</p><p>\"There's no question that the disruptive innovations have created some winners and losers,\" said Matt Schruers, the president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Amazon, Facebook and Google. \"I don't think there's any doubt members of Congress are hearing from those who have been on the losing side of some of these disruptive innovations, but consumer response to these products speaks for itself.\"</p><p>Not everyone sees it that way.</p><p>Tile long had benefited from Apple's good graces: The company behind those tiny trackers for your most important possessions even had a rare shout-out onstage at the iPhone giant's annual developer conference in 2018.</p><p>But the relationship soured as Apple inched closer toward rolling out a tool - built into its smartphone operating system - that seemed like \"something that's going to resemble our service,\" Kirsten Daru, Tile's general counsel, recalled in an interview ahead of her testimony Friday.</p><p>The result was \"Find My,\" an enhanced effort by Apple to help its customers better locate their lost devices. Not only does it mimic many of the features long offered by Tile, but it also has a major advantage: Apple turned on the location tracking that makes \"Find My\" functional by default. Rivals like Tile, meanwhile, must obtain users' permission in deep, hard-to-find smartphone settings, Daru said, then reauthorize it when presented with follow-up reminders.</p><p>Apple said the changes are about protecting privacy, citing a need to prevent app-makers from using consumers' data without their knowledge. \"Apple has not built a business model around knowing a customer's location or the location of their device,\" spokesman Fred Sainz said in a statement.</p><p>But Tile said the changes for now have resulted in a \"confusing and frustrating experience for our users,\" according to Daru, adding: \"We're looking to Congress to level the playing field.\"</p><p>David Heinemeier Hansson has a similar message for lawmakers. The well-known programmer and co-founder of Basecamp, which offers Web-based product management tools, said he plans to stress Friday that it's time for regulators to \"broaden your definition of what antitrust enforcement is.\"</p><p>For Basecamp, the trouble centers on Google's dominant search engine, which aided the tech giant in amassing $117 billion in ad revenue in 2018. Basecamp's competitors have been purchasing ads on Google against the company's own name, he said, meaning people who search for Hansson's company see rivals unless they scroll down their results page. To Hansson, it means Google requires companies \"to pay protection money\" - or risk obscurity.</p><p>\"They built their monopoly by having a great search engine,\" he said. \"Now that they have that monopoly, they're exploiting it to reap monopoly profits.\"</p><p>In response, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda rebuffed Basecamp's claims. He said competitors are allowed to \"bid on trademarked terms because it offers users more choice when they are searching,\" but he added Google will remove their names from text if they file a complaint.</p><p>By airing their criticisms publicly, many of Big Tech's biggest challengers seek to change the political calculus. Scores of companies long have been willing to grouse about their bigger tech brethren only privately, afraid of squandering much-needed relationships or scaring off investors wary of open warfare.</p><p>But renewed antitrust interest in Washington has some corporate boardrooms rethinking their plans, as they labor to attract the attention of regulators who say they are ready to do something about it. The troubles aired at the hearing Friday could later shape state and federal probes, leading to significant penalties, lawmakers and experts said.</p><p>\"I don't think we've ever faced a situation where there's such a small group of companies with such unprecedented size, scale and dominance,\" said Patrick Spence, the chief executive of Sonos.</p><p>This month, the audio company revealed in court documents it is suing Google, alleging the search giant copied its technology. Google has denied the charge and this week claimed Sonos has made \"misleading statements.\" But Spence said Google's behavior reflects a culture where big companies are \"doing the math\" and determining they can act as they please and survive the punishment. Sonos previously kept the standoff quiet for years, a sign to some about the fear of challenging the largest tech companies publicly.</p><p>\"It might be life or death for them,\" Spence said.</p><p>To the average Amazon shopper, it might not have seemed anything was amiss with PopSockets, either. Their small, circular handles, attached to the back of iPhones and Androids, were readily available on the e-commerce site. But that obscured a lengthy, tense relationship between the two companies that later cost PopSockets millions of dollars, said Barnett, the leader of PopSockets.</p><p>In its earlier days, PopSockets tried to get Amazon's attention about counterfeits sold there, only to be browbeaten by the tech giant into spending more on marketing, according to Barnett. Adding to the headaches, PopSockets fretted about Amazon policies that essentially left it little choice but to sell directly to Amazon, which then determined the prices of the products it later sold to customers.</p><p>For its part, Amazon disputed that it asked PopSockets to pay more to help with counterfeits. And it attributed the larger debacle to the fact that PopSockets ran afoul of its rules. Those policies require some popular Amazon brands to sell their products to the e-commerce company, which then sells them to consumers. Amazon contends PopSockets instead sought to sell its smartphone accessories through an intermediary.</p><p>\"Amazon obsesses over our customer experience, and we have policies for brands to ensure they are consistently meeting customer expectations,\" said Jack Evans, a spokesman at Amazon.</p><p>But Barnett said the restrictions proved too limiting. While he since has sought to restart his relationship with Amazon, the PopSockets leader recalled Amazon officials at one point trying - unsuccessfully - to strong-arm the company even after it reached its breaking point.</p><p>\"They acted as if it wasn't in our power to break up with them,\" he said. \"For most businesses our age, it's not in their power to break up with Amazon. It's not within their power to find an alternative.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-60e6d95fdf0e4434835b8a83dbcede57</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0J-2SM1-JB4M-V3HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1848\"/><timeReceived>1:31 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

These third parties included Facebook, Google and Amazon. It also stands that these big tech players could easily sell on the data to other companies, without the user of the app being aware that this has happened. The security issue raises new concerns about who owns personal data - the company that owns the app or the user of the app?Who owns health data? There are many people or entities who could claim ownership[2] over a patient's medical information. Does the physician own it? The medical institution? Some third party? The complexity arises between ownership of information belonging to either the individual or the company who created the means to obtain the information.  The complexity arises because some countries and indeed most states in U.S.[3] do not have law to confer specific ownership of medical data to patients. Questions of data ownership and what happens to the data are important, given the ever growing popularity of health apps. In a Rock Health survey[4], 90 percent of respondents reported using at least one digital health tool; this was an increase from 80 percent from the preceding 12 month period.  The new research looked at[5] apps developed for the Android mobile platform and which are commercially available in the U.K., U.S., Canada and Australia. The study, led by Quinn Grundy at the University of Toronto, and published in the BMJ throws out a further concern[6] given that health data was shared despite statements from the developers that they do not collect personally identifiable information. However, the medical researchers showed that data could be traced back and hence users could be easily identified by piecing together data trails or metadata ('data about data'), like the user's Android phone's unique address. The study recommends that doctors should be warning their patients about the threat to their privacy from using such health apps and that government regulators need to consider that loss of privacy is not a fair cost for the use of digital health services.
