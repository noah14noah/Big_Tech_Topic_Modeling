Google's high-profile acquisition of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion last year, mainly for its portfolio of 17,000 granted patents and 6,800 patents pending, illustrates how important IPR is in the modern technology sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ownership of IPR is only one part of what investors look for in a tech business. They want to know that the valuable assets lie with the business, but, more importantly, that the company's IPR is not going to be challenged.  An investor will want the funds he invests to help grow the business and give him a decent return, not be swallowed by litigation costs. This is becoming more and more of a risk, as various recent disputes between big tech players like Google, Oracle, Facebook, Yahoo, Samsung and Apple demonstrate. As Joshua Walker (Chairman of Lex Machina, which compiles and analyses data on intellectual property litigation) commented in the Economist at the end of last year, \"this really is the first global patent war\" (Economist, 19 December 2011).</p><p>In addition, technology companies are especially at risk from the increasingly aggressive approaches taken by so-called 'patent trolls', entities which exist solely to hold patents and use the threat of litigation to extract profitable licence fees in respect of these.</p><p>In this article, Adam Kuan and Peter Dalton consider what steps a technology company reliant on key IPR should take to maximise the value of its assets and ensure that its IP portfolio is best presented to potential investors.  We have assumed a company structure, although these issues would equally apply to sole trader or partnership structures.</p><p>1) Identify the IP used by the company</p><p>The first step is to identify the IPR used by the company. This may not always be as easy as it sounds, especially in the case of unregistered IPR (i.e. IPR not registered with a national registry such as the UK's Intellectual Property Office) if records have not been kept up to date.</p><p>As a guideline, the following is a (non-exhaustive) list of the IPR we might expect to a company to own:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"296\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"328\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> Registered IPR</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Unregistered IPR</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> Trade Marks </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Unregistered trade marks (including logos, commonly used branding etc.) </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> Patents </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Know-how, confidential information and trade secrets </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> Registered designs </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Unregistered designs </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> Domain Names (not strictly an IPR but nevertheless generally included as IPR in a corporate transactions) </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Literature such as product manuals etc.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Software code</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Website design</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Databases</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> Any other registered rights available in other jurisdictions (for example copyright registered in the US) </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Database rights in databases, such as customer lists or databases licensed by the company as part of software products </entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>In particular you should seek to identify the core asset of the company, and whether this is adequately protected by relevant IPR.  For example, the company may have developed a particular piece of software which generates the majority of the company's revenue and value.  Whilst investors or buyers will want to know about all of the IP owned by the company, they will be particularly concerned about the IPR protection afforded to core assets. They will want assurance that all core IP which is capable of being registered has been registered (or has pending applications for registration) in all key jurisdictions in which the company operates (or intends to operate in the future). Any challenges to the subsistence of IP in core assets, or to the validity of registered IPR, may be critical to whether the transaction goes ahead.</p><p>Summary:</p><p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>You will need to be able to identify the unregistered and registered IPR used by the company;</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Core assets are particularly important and investors will want to see that these are adequately protected.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>2) Establish ownership of IPR</p><p>Some IPR is likely to be owned by third parties, and licensed by the company (see section 4 below). For IPR owned by the company, investors and buyers will want to see evidence that the company is the proper owner.</p><p>a) Registered IPR</p><p>In respect of Registered IPR, it should be relatively easy to show that the company is the owner.  You will need to make sure that the company is recorded as the owner of the registered IPR in all relevant national registries. In many cases it will be possible to obtain such evidence from the website of the registry in question, although in some jurisdictions the company may have to rely on a paper certificate. If IPR has previously been transferred to the company, ensure that there is a formal written agreement assigning the relevant rights and that this change of ownership is recorded in the relevant national registries.</p><p>b) Unregistered IPR</p><p>With unregistered IPR, there may be no single document which proves ownership. You will need to show a chain of ownership from the original creator of the IPR which shows that the company is now the proper owner.</p><p>You will therefore need to identify the original creator; as a general rule, work created by an employee is in the course of employment belongs to the employer, not the employee. However, a buyer or investor will often want to see contracts of employment with that employee to ensure that there is nothing contradictory in those employment contracts which could displace this presumption. Generally it is best to have a specific clause in those contracts which sets out that IPR produced during the course of the employment belongs to the employer.</p><p>This presumption does not apply to work produced by third party contractors.  Here the default position is that IPR belongs to the contractor, not the party which commissioned the work. The commissioning party will often simply have a licence to use the work in question (although the terms of such a licence will not be clear).  It will therefore be necessary to show that the contract of work contained a clause by which the contractor assigned all IPR in the work to the company.  If you cannot show this, any buyer or investor may require the company to obtain such an assignment from the contractor.</p><p>If you have purchased or otherwise obtained unregistered IPR under an assignment from a third party, you may need to show that the assignor was the proper owner of the unregistered IPR when it was assigned to the company.  Investors / buyers may be satisfied if the document assigning the IPR contained a warranty to that effect given by the assignor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Showing ownership of registered IPR will generally be relatively easy, as the registration documents should show ownership.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>For unregistered IPR you will need to show the IPR passed from the original creator to the company. This may involve producing contracts governing the creation of the IPR.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>IPR produced by an employee in the course of employment is owned by the employer, however in the absence of written agreement to the contrary, IPR produced by a contractor is owned by that contractor, not the party commissioning the work. These presumptions can be displaced, most often by terms in the employment or contractor contract.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>3) Third party challenges</p><p>Buyers or investors will want to know the extent of any allegations that the company's IPR infringes third party rights (this includes applications to invalidate, cancel, revoke or modify registered IPR) or that the IPR is otherwise not capable of protection. They will also want to know about any infringement allegations made by the company against third parties.  If the company is involved in litigation which could threaten the company's ability to use a core piece of IPR in the future, this is likely to be a serious stumbling block for any investor or buyer.</p><p>It is also likely that you will be asked to disclose what checks have been made to ensure that such risks do not exist in the immediate future.   For example, were searches undertaken when trade marks were registered to ensure that there were not similar marks registered which could be used to challenge the registration. Or when entering a new market, were freedom to market searches undertaken to look for patents which might exist in that area.  Registered IPR can still be challenged by pre-existing IPR holders, even if no complaint was raised when the registration was originally made; such searches and checks will help satisfy buyers / investors that the registration is secure.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Investors or buyers will want to know:</p><p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>whether there have been any allegations of IP infringement by or against the company;</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>whether there have been any challenges to the validity or subsistence of the company's IPR; and</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>what checks as to the existence of third party rights have been made.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>4) Licences</p><p>Licences in</p><p>You will need to consider what IPR your company licenses in from third parties. Buyers or investors will want to know that your company has valid licences to use any third party IPR which it needs. This will be especially important if your core products or services incorporate such third party IPR.  If your company uses third party IPR on an informal basis, you should consider putting in place formal written licences with proper commercial terms.</p><p>Whilst some licences will be clearly marked in individual licence documents, other documents may also contain licences which are not immediately clear; for example, research and development, collaboration, trade mark co-existence agreements and IT Services Agreements could all incorporate some form of IPR licence.</p><p>You should also be aware of the terms of licences and whether they contain onerous provisions or represent areas of risk for the business of the company. For example, overly high royalty rates, uncapped indemnities given by the company, or abilities of the licensor to terminate at will and thus remove the company's right to use the subject of the licence. Buyers and investors are likely to request copies of licences, certainly in respect of core products or services, and you will need to be able to justify any questionable terms.</p><p>Licences out</p><p>You will also need to be able to identify any licences of IPR which your company has given and provide copies of these.  Buyers and investors will want to be sure that such licences are in the company's interests and give it adequate protection in respect of the licensee's use of the licensed IPR.  As well as any formal licences, you should consider whether the company has given any informal permissions to third parties to use IPR.  These may need to be formalised in written licences.</p><p>General considerations</p><p>It will also be important to consider whether any licences (in or out) contain change control provisions which could be triggered by the proposed transaction; if so, these licences may need to be varied to ensure they continue after the transaction has taken place.</p><p>You will also be required to identify any material breaches of licences which have occurred or have been alleged, again either by or against the company.</p><p>Summary:</p><p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>You will need to be able to identify that the company has a formal licence of any IPR needed by the business, and that such licences do not contain overly onerous terms and will not be jeopardised by the proposed transaction or by any other situation in the immediate future.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Buyers and investors will also want to see the terms of any licences of the company's IPR to third parties, to ensure that these are on appropriate commercial terms.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>5) Open Source Software</p><p>The presence of open source software (OSS) in a target company's products was once considered a potential deal breaker.  This is no longer the case as OSS has become more mainstream; however, especially where the company in question is a software provider, buyers or investors will want to satisfy themselves that the use of OSS in the company or its products does not compromise the business of the company.</p><p>Questions which are likely to be asked include:</p><p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Where the OSS originates from;</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>What the OSS does;</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Where or how the OSS is being used and re-used internally or distributed externally;</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>The terms of OSS licences and whether there are conditions on use; for example a requirement that any distribution includes copyright notices or attributions or (more importantly) that the source code must be made available if a derivative work is created and distributed.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>In general the use of OSS is unlikely to be a major issue, especially if such OSS is licensed under permissive licences such as MIT or BSD. Where OSS is governed by restrictive licences (especially those containing 'copyleft' provisions which require source code of derivative works to be made available to the public) this is likely to be ok as long as the software in question is only used internally and is not distributed outside the company (either in isolation or as part of a wider product). However, care must be exercised where products / services containing OSS licensed under restrictive licences (such as the GPL) are distributed to third parties, where this could give rise to a risk that source code in proprietary software must be disclosed.</p><p>Summary:</p><p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Buyers and investors generally understand that it is sometimes appropriate to use OSS.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>However, you must be able to adequately document your company's use of OSS to ensure that the use does not present any risks to the company.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>In particular, investors or buyers will want to know that the company is in compliance with any OSS licences, and that no licence poses a risk to the business model (for example by imposing 'copyleft' provisions on proprietary software owned by the company which might require the source code to be disclosed).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>6) Encumbrances, confidential  information and competition</p><p>Encumbrances</p><p>A buyer or investor will want to know whether any of your company's IPR is secured against lending, as this would reduce the value of that IPR to the company in the event of a sale. In the case of registered IPR, such encumbrances may be registered on the register.</p><p>Confidential Information</p><p>You may need to show that the company has put in place adequate protections to protect its confidential information. You may also be required to provide a schedule of such information. You will also need to identify any breaches of confidentiality which have taken place or have been alleged, either by or against the company.</p><p>You may also be required to provide a schedule of obligations of confidence owed to third parties in respect of third party confidential information in the hands of the company.</p><p>Competition</p><p>Technology or software companies are often at risk of falling foul of competition law where their market share is such that they can be said to be in a dominant position.  Smaller companies are not immune if the market they operate in is defined narrowly by the relevant competition regulator.</p><p>In such a situation, business practices which are deemed 'anti-competitive', such as excessive pricing, price fixing, or bundling of products, can be prohibited.  Regulators can even force dominant companies to licence industry standard technology to their competitors in order to encourage competition.</p><p>You may therefore be asked to provide evidence of the company's market share in its particular market, and also evidence as to whether any competition issues have been raised in the past.  Buyers or investors may also wish to scrutinise licences or agreements with third parties relating to the company's IPR, to see if these contain anti-competitive terms which could be challenged.</p><p>Summary:</p><p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>You will need to identify IPR which is secured against debts; this will reduce the value of the IPR in the eyes of the investor / buyer.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>The company's confidential information is also an important IPR of the company which you will need to show is properly recorded and protected.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>If your company is in a dominant position in the market, regulators could restrict certain 'anti-competitive' business practices and even require industry standard IPR to be licensed to competitors. You will need to be able to demonstrate to a buyer or seller how likely it is that the company is in such a position, and if so whether its activities could be deemed 'anti-competitive'.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Comment</p><p>Investors or buyers will require evidence that the target company has a strategy in place for properly protecting its intellectual property assets. Whilst this likely to be especially important where the company operates in the technology or digital sectors, it is increasingly something which will be expected of all companies regardless of the sector in which they operate.</p><p>It is important therefore to be able to demonstrate at the outset of a potential transaction that IPR is being pro-actively managed, protected and enforced, with a clear view of the importance of IPR to the overall business strategy of the company.  This will help to ensure that no issues with IPR are encountered down the line, and also help demonstrate that the company is well managed and potentially a good prospect for investment or purchase.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The rule has had an 8-fold word-count increase.</p><p>The federation now pronounces on details going all the way from maximum dimensions to whether the racket can have communications equipment embedded within it.</p><p>From whether a player can use two rackets at the same time to whether a racket can carry a solar cell or battery. There's a serious point in all this. Tennis works as a competition because the ITF makes sure that the rules are kept up to date with changes that take place.</p><p>We the public are the ultimate beneficiaries of the wonders of sport at this level and we can enjoy the game decade after decade because the rules keep up with the technology.</p><p>To paraphrase The Leopard, if the game is to stay the same, everything must change.</p><p>And so, I want to argue today, the same is true for competition in the economy.</p><p>If we want to have rivalry, we want to continue to do the unrivalled good that competition has, in the past, done for our economy, we must constantly adapt its rules.</p><p>There are three main reasons that the rules of competition must change:</p><p>First, this is unfinished business from the recent past, we have got to make retail markets in regulated sectors - like energy, finance and telecoms - work consistently in the interests of all households.</p><p>Second, platforms, big tech, big data are, as everyone knows, disrupting the basic plumbing of markets and, despite the huge benefits they have brought, they sometimes create new forms of harm - especially for vulnerable consumers. Third, we have a productivity problem to solve and competition policy is one of the really powerful tools for improving the economic performance of firms.</p><p>All over the world, governments and competition authorities have seen that the promises made of the system, that was slowly built over the last 40 years with Britain leading the way consistently, has sometimes fallen short in the face of new threats.</p><p>In this talk, I'd like to take stock of what we've achieved in the last three years and to talk a bit about what needs to be done and to communicate why, in my view, it is so urgent we get on with this.</p><p>But before turning to each of these, allow me a brief, historical detour which I hope will show that government shaping of markets has always been with us, and needs to be approached without ideology - pro or contra - but in a pragmatic and empirical spirit.</p><p>You can go to the British Museum today and see a stamp of King Alfred's penny on a half-pound lead weight. It had been given the King's seal of approval, literally. You could buy your grain and the King vouched for the weight you'd get in exchange. And there's an obvious reason; Alfred needed to regulate markets.</p><p>Just imagine the Monty-Pythonesque scene of a market on the Mercia/Wessex border, circa 880AD, where the miller defends himself against a buyer claiming fraud.</p><p>He claims his weights are right. The baker offers another definition of the pound, and the butcher a third.</p><p>If you think mobile phone tariffs can be confusing, just imagine comparison when different suppliers don't agree on basic measures of minutes or gigabytes.</p><p>Regulation to make sure that competitive markets can even establish themselves has been the stuff of government forever.</p><p>Our complex modern economies work because we've been able to push away the boundaries of mistrust.</p><p>The extraordinary wealth that has been created and spread by national and international markets is underpinned by the countless rules and mechanisms of regulation. Much of it, from the joint stock company to food standards, backed by the force of law.</p><p>But that's not the only reason that Alfred had to regulate markets. It was also that by unifying Wessex, Anglia and Mercia, that he created a single market and so disrupted older patterns of exchange. And this was very good for all the reasons that we know - insurance, specialisation, etc.</p><p>But it also undermined some of the traditional social mechanisms in which trust was rooted. If you didn't know people in your town or village or wider area, then the traditional foundations of trust may not be adequate.</p><p>And so, regulation, again, filled the gap and allowed the new markets to flourish.</p><p>If good regulation does not accompany disruptions, then they can be resented, especially by those most reliant on those old social contexts.</p><p>This need to make new retail markets work for all fits, in many respects, the problem we have today.</p><p>I think of it as unfinished business of creating well-functioning consumer markets in the basic utility sectors that have been gradually deregulated over the last 40 years.</p><p>There have been some huge successes in this programme.</p><p>Technological disruption, driven by carefully constructed competition in telecoms, for example, has completely transformed our lives.</p><p>The same scale of transformation cannot yet be claimed for how we use gas, electricity or water.</p><p>The basic philosophy of utility deregulation in domestic retail markets was that we could eventually replicate the sorts of healthy, competitive markets that have evolved in essentials like food.</p><p>This was part of the broader new regulatory philosophy pioneered by Britain 40 years ago and copied all over the world.</p><p>The retail markets piece of this transformation still needs further development.</p><p>First, there's the relatively slow pace of basic innovation in some of these markets. Second, they have often settled into business models in which many consumers continue to be subjected to higher prices than can be justified, while a savvy minority benefit from very cheap deals.</p><p>The CMA called this to public attention with the problem of default tariffs in energy. Martin Cave, who wrote the dissenting minority opinion to the CMA report is here and now chairs Ofgem.</p><p>This recommendation to impose a retail price cap on default tariffs was made and Citizens Advice followed this up with, in my view, its very welcome Super-Complaint to the CMA, applying this argument to other markets.</p><p>Let me take this moment to thank the Social Market Foundation and James Kirkup, in particular for the traditions and the work that this organisation has done to advance our understanding of the issue and how we can tackle it.</p><p>The loyalty penalty has now been extensively analysed by the CMA and other regulators.</p><p>The numbers can be eye-watering.</p><p>A household inactive in all the markets studied risks being over-charged by \\xA31549 per year.</p><p>That is the same amount as the entire, annual discretionary spending of the poorest 10% of households, and often there is a close collaboration between the poorest and those who are paying higher.</p><p>This government has responded extremely supportively to the CMA's recommendations on the loyalty penalty. Business and their regulators must find ways to end the worst effects of these business models and the companies involved should look to the energy industry as a proof of our seriousness in the lengths we need the regulators to go to.</p><p>Luring consumers onto cheap tariffs in the hope that many of them will fail to notice subsequent price rises should be seen as simply bad business.</p><p>Doing everything possible to confuse customers so they don't notice the rises is even worse. Protecting consumers from sharp practices has been a constant of Government in this country for centuries.</p><p>I've mentioned Alfred's standardisation of weights already. Another example comes in the medieval Assizes of Bread. Specialist courts that made sure that bakers and millers were stopped from selling substandard product.</p><p>A home insurance company that gradually turns the screws, an energy company that price-walks you up the curve; they are earning their gains on a sort of asymmetry of power and information in which we have long intervened.</p><p>These are business practices that rely on undermining the trust of the consumer.</p><p>The markets that have really benefited from competition are the ones in which innovation, quality and price are the focus of corporate energies - not the invention of a new pricing practice.</p><p>If the notion generally takes hold that our utility markets are rife with this sort of behaviour then the entire legitimacy, it seems to me, of that sector suffers, and indeed, the whole economy suffers.</p><p>This is a point that has been very eloquently put on many occasions by Lord Andrew Tyrie, with us today, whom I was delighted to appoint to be Chair of the CMA. Andrew's work before he took up this position as Chair of the Treasury Select Committee between 2010 and 2017 was infused by this very preoccupation. The legitimacy of our financial system being threatened by some, small number of bad apples in finance. And there are places where the same can be true in other household sectors today.</p><p>So, when it came to the decision to appoint a new Chair to the CMA, I knew that Andrew's combination of passion for the wellbeing of ordinary working people, his rigorous thinking and his ever-effective drive - having experienced it the other side of the Treasure select committee, being subject to grilling's from Andrew, I can attest to the rigour of that and thought he was the ideal person for the task.</p><p>And I was delighted that he received the unanimous backing of the BEIS select committee.</p><p>Everything that I see coming from the CMA confirms in my view that Andrew was the right choice.</p><p>Under his watch, the CMA has made it very clear that it would concentrate efforts on tackling consumer harms. The pace of change has been remarkable. From unfair administrative charges in care homes to an investigation of the funeral business. From cleaning up the online-ticketing market to hard-to-reverse subscriptions in online games. From excessive pricing in pharmaceuticals to ensuring merger activity does not undermine lively competition in the retail sector.</p><p>These cases and more in the future, together with a welcome emphasis on strong public communication of the essential work that the CMA does, will both solve immediate problems and tell the general public that when it comes to their lives as consumers the CMA has their back.</p><p>For this, I'd also like - as well as thanking Andrew - to commend Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's Chief Executive whom I also appointed, and to all those in their organisation who have contributed to this excellent work.</p><p>Recognising that competition policy is foundational to our economy and society, the first thing I asked Andrew in his new post was for the CMA's recommendations on how we should reform the system itself.</p><p>A large number of proposals were put to me in a thoughtful and comprehensive letter that some of you may have seen.</p><p>Let me start by making three points of principle.</p><p>First, the CMA wants its primary duty to be to the welfare of consumers. I have to say that at a philosophical level, I entirely agree.</p><p>Competition should never be seen as an end in itself, except perhaps last Sunday when watching England win the cricket. But normally, it's as a means to thriving lives on the part of consumers.</p><p>Many of Andrew's proposals relate to this basic shift in principle and the exact package we opt for will be a very important question to address, and do so urgently.</p><p>Second, the CMA wants the enforcement of consumer law to be as effective as is the enforcement of competition law, and asks for new powers to be shared between itself and the sectoral regulators to make this a reality.</p><p>As I have said already, in our response to the CMA's loyalty penalty report, I agree with that too.</p><p>This will help not only with the unfinished business but will also allow us to shape the new digital markets.</p><p>Third, the CMA is very concerned that the speed of disruption in the economy, from digital markets and big data, means that the current machinery of competition enforcement is too slow.</p><p>It is no good taking a tech company through the courts over many years, when in the meantime another three relevant markets have tipped into a winner-takes-all state.</p><p>Again, I have no doubt that this is true in principle.</p><p>This takes me back to what I said earlier about King Alfred's need to regulate markets after the unification of markets in Wessex and Mercia.</p><p>Cyberspace is a glorious new space for markets, but it is not in the long-term interest of business or consumers for it to become a low-trust environment, quite the reverse.</p><p>Achieving greater speed and flexibility will require some of the solutions put forward by Jason Furman, especially more principles-based ex ante regulation of platforms.</p><p>It will also require the CMA to be able to act more swiftly and robustly ex post where it finds anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>And I agree with the CMA on this. What is needed now is to find a way of speeding up this work while maintaining the UK's unparalleled reputation for procedural fairness and legal rights.</p><p>Our reputation is enormously valuable in terms of business confidence, and it must always be maintained. And I have asked my department to prepare advice on the options we have on this.</p><p>I would like to emphasise that these issues are urgent. Consumer mistrust in the economy must not be allowed to grow to be higher.</p><p>The positions of platforms become more entrenched and every day we become more aware of some of the exploitative business practices that have become easy to spread.</p><p>The CMA has produced a menu of reform options. The Furman Review has added to them. Our Smart Data Review has committed to some of these and to Furman's central recommendation - the establishment of a Digital Markets Unit.</p><p>Today, I am adding to this by publishing our strategic steer to the CMA and the Competition Law Review, a piece of analytical work on the technical performance of the competition regime which will provide important research material for the wider changes ahead.</p><p>Now is the time for industry, the legal profession, economists, consumer groups, regulators and civil society to respond to these initiatives and proposals.</p><p>And in this, I also very much think that we need to understand the views of judges and the judiciary since the appeals system is such an important part of enforcement. That will put all elements in place for a new administration to decide how to act on these pressing matters.</p><p>The power of the CMA's request for tools that can be used at speed arises, of course, from the spectre haunting all markets today; the disruption that can be associated with big platforms, big tech and big data.</p><p>But what exactly is that spectre?</p><p>Many ordinary consumers feel the pinch of loyalty penalties in recently deregulated sectors, and very few consumers think of the offerings from Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Spotify, Uber, Deliveroo, Ocado or Netflix as anything other than a miraculous revolution in terms of ease, quality and price.</p><p>Hands up here who remembers navigating London with an A to Z? Jumping off the page and having to fumble around the index, the pages becoming detached from the binder, often having to pull over, work out where the join in the pages was and how you transfer over - repeat and repeat and arrive usually very arrive late to your destination. If I were to mention the A to Z to my children, they wouldn't know what I was talking about.</p><p>Transactional ease is off-the-scale in all sorts of markets compared to where we were, even fewer than 20 years ago.</p><p>And yet the CMA and Jason Furman, who led our review of competition between the Tech Giants, are right that the rules need to be considered and may need to change if competition is to perform its magic there too.</p><p>Consumers may not feel the pinch when they click on that link for a cheaper credit card, but the card-issuer who has to recover the \\xA3100 that this click cost them on the search engine certainly does and will have to recover the cost from consumers somehow.</p><p>The holiday-maker usually does not see any cost from booking the charming B&amp;B by the seaside through Trip-Advisor, but the couple who have to fork out the social media referral fees do have an interest in ensuring that market is competitive.</p><p>Do consumers have effective control over their data and is what is done with it ultimately in their own interest?</p><p>These various, potential harms are only just becoming headline news and we need to make sure that they do not drown out all the good that platforms have brought us and continue to bring us.</p><p>The CMA has just launched a much-needed market study into digital advertising and Professor Furman recommended that we establish a Digital Markets Unit that will work to establish and enforce ex ante the principles by which we must shape these markets.</p><p>I trust that the CMA's analysis will provide some of the knowledge needed to establish the Digital Markets Unit. Some will, no doubt, groan at the suspicion that Government is trying to control cyberspace. There is no scarcity online.</p><p>And that is the reverse of the intention because, it seems to me, that if people are unhappy with how some things are, we should be looking to make sure that level of trust and confidence is maintained. The vision of cyberspace has some connections with American frontier town of the late 19th Century. Cyberspace has followed, in some respects, a similar revolution. It was that very period of expansion and excitement brought with it some of the monopolies that gave rise that the development and the birth of anti-regulation as we know it.</p><p>The power of railroad monopolies in the US led to the birth of anti-trust and sometimes accompanied by populist policies. So we need to make sure that what may have characteristics in digital platforms that could run the risk of sapping innovation, squeezing businesses and raising the prices of goods anticipates some of the problems that may arise. But consumer choice is just a click away, one might think, so what kind of monopoly do the giants really have?</p><p>Here, I would just like to say that one of the best things to have happened in the understanding of markets in the last 10 years, and Martin Cave has written extensively on this, has been the rise of realistic views of how consumers actually behave and not just how they ought to behave.</p><p>In the unfinished business in consumer markets, as well as in the new challenges posed by the oligopolies, and potential oligopolies of cyberspace, we need to guard against an overly-narrow conception of economics that I think has been part of the problem. Something that economics itself, I think, has made great strides in recent days in recognising.</p><p>This is why I have asked, in my steer to the CMA that it makes sure that it update its methodological toolkit, so it's not just relying on the old economic tools.</p><p>New approaches that use huge, rich datasets, disciplines like behavioural economics, psychology and anthropology all have their part to play in understanding how markets actually work, rather than how regulators have too often hoped they would work.</p><p>The CMA and other future-facing regulators like the FCA, Ofgem and the CAA are embracing these new tools and methodologies. I strongly welcome that and hope to see much more still.</p><p>Let me now turn to competition and productivity.</p><p>There are roughly four ways that changing the conditions of competition affects productivity.</p><p>First there are the direct effects of competition eliminating unearned rents. Prices fall so the real amount each worker can buy with the value created by an hour of work increases. Our energy price cap, for example, means a single person on the minimum wage need work almost two days fewer to pay for their annual energy bill. This is a significant difference to many people in this country.</p><p>What's more, the people and equipment that were employed in the rent-seeking activity are liberated to do something more productive and that has knock-on effects. Taking unearned rents out of supply chains makes businesses that rely on those inputs more productive. They have more surplus to spread over capital and labour after all inputs have been covered.</p><p>But against all these positive effects there is a potentially trickier relationship between competition and productivity, and specifically, incentives to innovate. Historically, the link between competition and innovation can sometimes be a paradoxical one.</p><p>Patent law is meant to grant inventors temporary monopoly. In that respect, it is an anti-competition policy.</p><p>There are good arguments to be had about whether patent today is working as it should, but what is clear is that all of us benefit when innovators are rewarded in this way.</p><p>The Nobel prize-winning economist Bill Nordhaus estimated that innovators capture only about 3% of the value that they create. The rest, 97%, goes to society at large, for free. So, it's strongly in our interest to back and reward innovation.</p><p>That's why so many elements of our Industrial Strategy put an emphasis on aligning all the strengths of companies, universities and government agencies.</p><p>Innovation is so valuable that we're happy to see coordination being delivered through public R&amp;D investment, common Grand Challenges that bring together companies, universities, research institutions and businesses, sector deals to line-up the efforts providing common research centres, common infrastructure and investments in education.</p><p>And traditional merger control needs to consider this delicate balance between competition and coordination. When a big pharma company buys the minnow with a promising molecule for a spectacular sum is it helping to get a valuable product to market or is it taking out potential competition against something it has on its own lab-bench? In the first case, a merger authority should OK the deal. In the second, in my view, it should say no.</p><p>Jason Furman wondered about the same effect within Big Tech. When Facebook bought pre-revenue Instagram and WhatsApp for billions, which of these was it doing?</p><p>If the power of innovation is to be fully realised for the general good, our approach to mergers must now ask these hard and detailed questions.</p><p>I was very pleased to see the CMA doing so in its recent decision just last week to examine Amazon's investment in Deliveroo.</p><p>I'd like to finish this speech with some reflections on an absolutely foundational input which the CMA and this government have put a great deal of effort into improving, and that is audit. Again, one of the foundations of trust and reputation. Audit is the primary mechanism by which management's assessment of how a business is doing gets challenged, verified and made public.</p><p>We have reason, it seems to me, to have some concerns to be very concerned about the recent quality of audit, and to believe that this has wide repercussions on the performance of the whole economy.</p><p>There have been the high-profile failures that have made headlines. The BHS pension liability, Carillion, of course, and Patisserie Valerie.</p><p>But that's not all.</p><p>The Financial Reporting Council, our audit regulator, has just reported that one third of Price Waterhouse Cooper's audits of FTSE 350 companies failed to meet the standard of requiring only limited improvement.</p><p>Grant Thornton did even worse with only 50% of audits passing that threshold.</p><p>Not a single top 4 firm met the FRC's standard for 90% of audits last year.</p><p>Perhaps, even more troubling from an assessment of the state of competition, the CMA found that, between 2014 and 2017 KPMG, for example, grew its market share while also scoring worst of the Big 4 in audit quality.</p><p>And yet audit is a sector that should be ripe for disruptive innovation. Big data and AI could be transforming the practice.</p><p>Without the pressures of competition, will this technology be produce an even better audit? A succession of independent analyses have drawn attention to a systematic problems. Sir John Kingman in the review that I asked him to perform of the sector, the BEIS select committee in their report, the Financial Reporting Council itself and the CMA in its market study - excellent and dependable audit is a public good, the whole economy benefits from the fact that businesses choose to establish themselves in a jurisdiction in which confidence in audit is secured.</p><p>Capital is better allocated and at lower cost, the better quality information is.</p><p>The wide array of users of company accounts, not just shareholders but customers, suppliers, employees, places and civil society organisations too, can all the better rely on complex chains of interdependence when the quality of audit is good.</p><p>Solving the problem of audit quality can therefore bring great productivity benefits to the whole economy and make the UK an even better place to start and grow a business.</p><p>Competition should be central to that.</p><p>Company boards must have meaningful choice of auditors.</p><p>We cannot run the risk of systemic over-reliance on just a few firms that could reduce further.</p><p>The regulator needs to ensure that quality persists, despite the intrinsic problem of incentives in this market.</p><p>So I am pleased to have two important announcements to be able to make today. First, is to announce the appoint of Sir Jonathan Thompson as the new Chief Executive of the Financial Reporting Council. Many of you will know that he has been the recent head of HMRC, someone with a strong and rigorous record.</p><p>He will have the crucial task of transforming the organisation as it becomes the new and strengthened Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority, ARGA, created as recommended in Sir John Kingman's review.</p><p>And Second, I am publishing our consultation on the CMA's, in my view, powerful and compelling package of recommendations.</p><p>I believe that we need to act fast before another audit scandal makes headlines. I don't believe that we should wait for the review that I have asked Sir Donald Brydon to perform on the purpose of audit. Whatever the answer to that question, the mechanism to reach it will necessarily be delivered through a well-functioning market and a strong regulator.</p><p>But I would like to add this.</p><p>The audit sector should be in no doubt about the need and the resolve to make these reforms.</p><p>Audit quality must improve and we will do everything that's needed.</p><p>But the audit sector itself could do a great deal, now, voluntarily before any legislative change comes and I strongly urge them to do so.</p><p>It is right, it is good for the economy and it will give the sector much more credibility in helping shape the regime of the future.</p><p>Let me end as I started - with the weekend's sporting triumphs.</p><p>Here, according to the MCC's rulebook is how we come to know with confidence that last Sunday's score was actually the score that the umpires judged, and how cricket does its own version of audit, if you like. I quote:</p><p>Two scorers shall be appointed to record all runs [...] ...The scorers shall frequently check... ...to ensure that their records agree.</p><p>They shall agree with the umpires... ...at least at every interval [...]</p><p>The scorers shall accept all instructions and signals... ...given to them by the umpires... ...and shall immediately acknowledge each separate signal.</p><p>It is subtle and instructive.</p><p>It is suited to the particulars of the problem being solved.</p><p>Like all rules that evolve to make competition really work, it embodies and distils volumes of collected experience, wisdom and judgement in practice.</p><p>And just as Britain has led the world in codifying the rules of sport, as well as occasionally, and satisfyingly, winning at them, here I must mention for completeness the third of the weekend's great sporting fixtures and salute the amazing performance of Lewis Hamilton at Silverstone.</p><p>We should have every confidence that we should continue to lead in many ways the similar task, and in which we have long had a world-leading, international reputation of codifying and keeping the most innovative in the world, the rules of market and competition. It's one of our strongest and proudest exports.</p><p>The CMA, our regulators, government, our Parliament and our people collectively have the knowledge, pragmatism and experience to be winners at the economically crucial, global competition to design the rules of competition.</p><p>Getting this right has a great prize attached, a Fourth Industrial Revolution with new technologies, new markets, new opportunities underpinned by confidence by consumers, by market participants. This is a future marked by prosperity for all, in all parts of the country.</p><p>(United Kingdom Government)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMJ-PD61-DXMS-8239-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 22, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNU3</classCode><className>SPORTING GOODS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001707</classCode><className>TENNIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813990GM</classCode><className>SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A0KP</classCode><className>TENNIS TOURNAMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001485</classCode><className>RESTRAINT OF TRADE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Nzc5QTM2RDA2QTExNDg4Njk3MzJEQzkzODM4REJENEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDA2NTZCMDc0RDA0NDBCOEFFMjA0NTg1QTBGMjM3NTQ</classCode><className>Price Fixing &amp; Restraints of Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009FYB</classCode><className>MATERIALS SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNU3</classCode><className>SPORTING GOODS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001694</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DNNA</classCode><className>BATTERIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001878</classCode><className>SOLAR ENERGY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDlCOTMzNzhGREJBNDJENEEyM0ZGMjVFODI5Nzc4NTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA</classCode><className>Solar Power Industry</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Besides Britain, it also operates in several countries in Europe and Asia, including Germany, France, Italy and Australia.</p><p>The investigation comes as the regulator is taking a more activist role in seeking to protect consumers in an evolving marketplace.</p><p>``This type of deal is right in the CMA's area of interest at the moment - large tech incumbents like Amazon investing in smaller rivals - so called ``killer acquisitions,'' said Nicole Kar, head of the London Competition Practice at law firm Linklaters.</p><p>``You might not think there is much competition between Deliveroo and Amazon right at present given Deliveroo is very focused on food delivery but that's too simplistic. Amazon wants to get any product to the customer fast and to `own' the customer for everything they possibly want to buy in their life and every way they want it delivered.''</p><p>The investigation also comes as American authorities likewise are taking steps to reign in the growing power of large tech firms. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are moving to investigate Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices. In the U.S. Congress, the House Judiciary Committee has announced an antitrust probe, promising ``a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.''</p><p>In Britain, authorities on Wednesday launched a ``digital markets strategy,'' to respond to online platforms and to make the U.K. competition rules fit for the modern age. It says it will cooperate with authorities in other countries to ``consider the need for new approaches.''</p><p>In the case of Amazon's deal, British authorities will be looking into whether Deliveroo's partnerships with grocers like the Co-Op might signal an intention to build food delivery services beyond the core Deliveroo model at the moment, which is the delivery of food-to-go from restaurants and cafes. Kar added that the watchdog would be looking at whether the investment Amazon made into Deliveroo would give the tech titan the right to determine strategy and investment.</p><p>The exact amount of money Amazon spent on the stake is unclear, but Deliveroo's last fundraising round brought in 450 million pounds ($564 million) from multiple investors, with Amazon becoming the largest.</p><p>The CMA could block any deal, as it did recently by halting the attempted supermarket merger of Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda unit. The watchdog concluded that the creation of the country's biggest supermarket would push up prices and reduce quality for shoppers.</p><p>Both Amazon and Deliveroo pledged Friday to work closely with regulators.</p><p>``There are a number of major companies within the restaurant food delivery sector and this investment will enable Deliveroo to expand, innovate and, we believe, will enhance competition,'' Deliveroo said in a statement.</p><p>Amazon says the expansion will benefit consumers by increasing choice and by ``creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service.'' - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHC-2FB1-DXMS-853R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"599\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0008DC5</classCode><className>LINKLATERS LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Besides Britain, it also operates in several countries in Europe and Asia, including Germany, France, Italy and Australia.</p><p>The investigation comes as the regulator is taking a more activist role in seeking to protect consumers in an evolving marketplace.</p><p>``This type of deal is right in the CMA's area of interest at the moment - large tech incumbents like Amazon investing in smaller rivals - so called ``killer acquisitions,'' said Nicole Kar, head of the London Competition Practice at law firm Linklaters.</p><p>``You might not think there is much competition between Deliveroo and Amazon right at present given Deliveroo is very focused on food delivery but that's too simplistic. Amazon wants to get any product to the customer fast and to `own' the customer for everything they possibly want to buy in their life and every way they want it delivered.'' </p><p>The investigation also comes as American authorities likewise are taking steps to reign in the growing power of large tech firms. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are moving to investigate Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices. In the U.S. Congress, the House Judiciary Committee has announced an antitrust probe, promising ``a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.''</p><p>In Britain, authorities on Wednesday launched a ``digital markets strategy,'' to respond to online platforms and to make the U.K. competition rules fit for the modern age. It says it will cooperate with authorities in other countries to ``consider the need for new approaches.''</p><p>In the case of Amazon's deal, British authorities will be looking into whether Deliveroo's partnerships with grocers like the Co-Op might signal an intention to build food delivery services beyond the core Deliveroo model at the moment, which is the delivery of food-to-go from restaurants and cafes. Kar added that the watchdog would be looking at whether the investment Amazon made into Deliveroo would give the tech titan the right to determine strategy and investment.</p><p>The exact amount of money Amazon spent on the stake is unclear, but Deliveroo's last fundraising round brought in 450 million pounds ($564 million) from multiple investors, with Amazon becoming the largest.</p><p>The CMA could block any deal, as it did recently by halting the attempted supermarket merger of Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda unit. The watchdog concluded that the creation of the country's biggest supermarket would push up prices and reduce quality for shoppers.</p><p>Both Amazon and Deliveroo pledged Friday to work closely with regulators.</p><p>``There are a number of major companies within the restaurant food delivery sector and this investment will enable Deliveroo to expand, innovate and, we believe, will enhance competition,'' Deliveroo said in a statement. </p><p>Amazon says the expansion will benefit consumers by increasing choice and by ``creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service.'' - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2252769006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFT-V8R1-JBHT-D38S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"601\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0008DC5</classCode><className>LINKLATERS LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now, though, California practitioners are seeing a general stabilization and several bright spots, even with volume continuing to fall in purely domestic deals. Acquisitions originating abroad are rising fast as industries develop and mature around the world, but particularly in China; tech M&amp;A is continuing strong; and clients are more interested than ever in legal advice about the strategic aspects of deals, rather than just the technical. California Lawyer checked in for an update on the field with Joseph M. Doloboff of Blank Rome; Jaclyn Liu of Morrison &amp; Foerster; E. Thom (Todd) Rumberger of Foley &amp; Lardner; and Thomas M. Shoesmith of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. The roundtable was moderated by California Lawyer and reported by Donna Blum of Barkley Court Reporters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MODERATOR: There's been a pretty significant drop in M&amp;A this year, even though there were signs in 2011 and 2012 that the volume would be higher, and that seems to be among the most significant continuing issues. What are the biggest new developments in your practice in the last year or so?</p><p>JACLYN LIU: You're right; M&amp;A volume was down in the U.S. about 4 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. Everyone is predicting an uncertain U.S. M&amp;A market with shrinkage in 2013 at the same levels as 2012. And a number of bankers are saying, from their firsthand experience, that the dip is expected to be more significant. There is, however, an uptick in outbound M&amp;A activities from China during the first half of 2013, which has continued for a couple of years. In the past, a majority of my M&amp;A work involved domestic or European companies. However, all but one M&amp;A matter that I worked on during the past year involved an Asian or European party either as the seller or the acquirer. And, previously, inbound M&amp;A involved mostly foreign companies acquiring divisions of U.S. public companies or private U.S.companies; more recently foreign companies are buying U.S. public companies outright, which adds complexity and deal challenges.</p><p>MODERATOR: What kinds of companies? What kinds of industries?</p><p>LIU: Across the board; I helped a French co-op acquire apple orchard productions in the U.S., SoftBank in its acquisition of Sprint, and a Chinese medical device company in its acquisition of a division of a U.S. public company. But my M&amp;A work is predominantly in the technology space.</p><p>MODERATOR: Todd [Rumberger], what big trends are you seeing in your practice in Silicon Valley?</p><p>TODD RUMBERGER: The trend personally for me was a very active M&amp;A plate last year, leading down to the wire and into the holidays, in large part people trying to beat the 12/31 deadline, the fiscal cliff. It was everybody's expectation that, because of the general acceptance that taxes would be going up, sellers were going to get a lot better net result if the deal closed by year-end. This work included both typical Silicon Valley M&amp;A involving big tech acquisitions of early-stage and venture-backed companies, but also a number of deals in the private equity arena, which has its own style for the way the deals are structured and negotiated, not dissimilar to the more pragmatic way venture financings on the West Coast are negotiated, with some well known deal points up for grabs and many others simply not pushed too hard; deal certainty and getting to the closing are paramount once the decision is made to buy (or sell).</p><p>MODERATOR: So you're not seeing a drop except to the extent people are sort of catching their breath?</p><p>RUMBERGER: Yes, though it seems like some deals which were jumping on my radar early this year have been stalled, not dead, but not making nearly the progress deals were making last year at this time; I don't think many people expected a slow-down in the first half of the year, but we experienced one.</p><p>LIU: Yes, money is still relatively cheap.</p><p>JOSEPH DOLOBOFF: I've seen three major trends. First, some large, public high-tech companies that did a lot of acquisitions and are now in the integration stage. Where I've seen the largest drop-off is in the number of leveraged recapitalizations-taking advantage of a good debt market-where private-equity firms came in, took majority ownership of a company, and allowed founders who had grown the company to take a bunch of chips off the table yet retain a significant minority ownership interest. Those deals have fallen off quite a bit now that we've got the increase in capital gains tax rates; that 5 percent made a big difference.</p><p>The third trend that I see, and maybe because I'm focused on the tax side, is more companies with large net operating losses that are looking at acquisitions of companies that are heavy taxpayers, which they can acquire at a higher price because they have the advantage of the operating loss tax shelter. The public company deals, which for me are mostly on the high-tech side, I expect to pick back up at the end of the summer.</p><p>THOMAS SHOESMITH: Our overall M&amp;A activity is probably down by more or less the same percentages that Jackie [Liu] was mentioning. But, by sector, it's actually pretty strong and in many cases up, which is also consistent with her experience. Our Silicon Valley office, which is heavily concentrated on technology companies, is very active in M&amp;A right now. There are market fundamentals at work, of course, as well as industry trends. Many large tech companies, for example, particularly in life sciences, have become expert at outsourcing innovation and then buying the winners. The oil and gas and energy sectors are also very strong. And then of course China has been an area where we've seen a lot of changes and a lot of activity. The switch from outbound investment from the U.S., to inbound investment from China, has been dramatic. We all thought it was going to happen-</p><p>LIU: A long time ago.</p><p>SHOESMITH: That's right. It's been \"about to happen\" for at least five years, but now it's happening. That's exciting and different. Investment from the U.S. into China also is changing. Ten years ago it was primarily aimed at manufacturing for export. Now the attraction is the huge market in China and more broadly in Asia.</p><p>LIU: And that trend changes the due diligence requirements of an acquirer. It's much easier to conduct physical due diligence on a factory than if the value driver for the acquisition is the Chinese target's distribution or marketing channels. The old adage was: Retain the target's general manager, who will know the ins and outs of the business, and you are golden. But not anymore. As the value drivers for inbound M&amp;A move beyond brick and mortar to leverage Chinese manufacturing efficiencies, the due diligence process for such deals will become more \"U.S. style.\"</p><p>A certain amount of patience on the part of foreign acquirers is needed as many Chinese targets are not prepared for such intense legal and financial scrutiny of their businesses.</p><p>SHOESMITH: The big change that's happened in my practice is that U.S. clients looking at China don't just see a lot of people who work cheap; they're now seeing a tremendous market. For example, China is now the biggest market in the world for smart phones.</p><p>MODERATOR: But another key change you're seeing this year is more investment from China.</p><p>SHOESMITH: That's true. And inbound investment from China has been driven by the big players. The wave of smaller buyers is just starting. The last time we had a wave of inbound foreign investment like this was the Japanese in the 1980s and '90s. Of course, there, you were dealing with large corporations but not state-owned enterprises, and that makes Chinese investment more policy-driven than was the case with the Japanese. And the Chinese are buying strategic properties as well as less glamorous but often highly productive businesses like-</p><p>RUMBERGER: Chicken producers.</p><p>SHOESMITH: That's right-chicken, pork.</p><p>LIU: Beyond state-owned enterprises (SOEs), a few factors that have fueled outbound M&amp;A activities from China are the volumes of Chinese companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the PRC domestic exchanges, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Listing there has provided private Chinese companies, not just the SOEs, with the capital necessary to invest and acquire abroad. Also, in connection with the listing process, those Chinese companies would set up a Caymans or BVI holding company with some capital residing offshore. This is significant because in my prior experience Chinese acquirers rarely were the successful bidders in a bidding war for a U.S. target. Part of the problem was the lack of sophistication in deal-making but a large part was the inaccessibility of the money. If the money was located in the PRC, savvy sellers would immediately know the process would take no less than four to six months, and that was often a deal-breaker.</p><p>DOLOBOFF: I think globalization comes in all shapes and sizes. In deals I do for domestic high-tech companies, they may be buying another domestic company, but the chances are nearly 99 percent that the target has operations in other countries. So almost every deal has some global aspects to it, and you have to bring in advisers from outside of the U.S. with skills in other jurisdictions to get almost any deal done.</p><p>SHOESMITH: I agree. Twenty years ago, when I said \"I'm an international lawyer,\" most people said, \"What's that?\" Now, if I said the same thing, they'd say, \"So am I.\" China is still a special case, though. I think it is by far the most surprising place for Westerners to do business-and I've done transactions in Korea, Japan, the Middle East, Latin America and a number of other countries. I always say China confronts Westerners with two levels of surprises. Of course you expect to be surprised in a deal, but in China it's in a way and for a reason that is surprising. The intricacy of the web of inter-relationships in China that affects every deal is pervasive and mostly opaque to an outsider, even to a Westerner who has lived there for many years. And, if the counter-party doesn't have a Western-trained person, then one side is negotiating holistically and the other linearly.</p><p>DOLOBOFF: Even setting negotiations aside, due diligence can be frustrating. I was quite surprised at how difficult it is to obtain from a China-based company certain information that we take for granted in domestic deals.</p><p>SHOESMITH: In part this is a function of business cultures. It isn't necessarily advantageous to be transparent in China. And you're right, it makes diligence really hard. I think transparency is an attribute of large, diversified and mostly impersonal economies, which China has not been until recently. A hundred years ago in this country, for example, all the great capitalists knew each other. You could put them all in one room. In fact, J. P. Morgan often did. They exchanged information among themselves, but transparency to the world at large was essentially unknown. China is developing very, very fast and I think we'll see more transparency as it does. A world-class economy can't exist for long without it.</p><p>LIU: From my experience, most Chinese companies don't start a business with an exit strategy in mind. Most Chinese entrepreneurs are focused on maintaining a nice, stable business that they can hand off to their family. Such a mindset impacts how the business is structured and the attention to legal formalities. Of course, business dynamics are changing in China now.</p><p>SHOESMITH: One of the interesting things about China is that it's passing from one system to another, so you see this sort of mixing of the waters. Chinese companies are becoming more international, and the number of internationally educated entrepreneurs and managers is increasing dramatically. I imagine it won't be long before Chinese clients use lawyers throughout the course of a deal -and less often bring me a signed purchase agreement and ask me to take a look at it.</p><p>MODERATOR: That's what's called a done deal. Moving to increasing regulation in both the U.S. and China, are tax concerns causing competitive problems? Is the American regulatory picture at this point an impediment compared to what you're facing in other countries, or is that challenge overblown?</p><p>DOLOBOFF: The provision of our tax code that taxes companies on profits they earn overseas when they don't even bring the money back to the U.S. paves a difficult road for U.S.companies when they're making acquisitions abroad. Also, tax law changes that would encourage companies to bring cash back to the U.S. where it could be deployed to help build more jobs just can't be a bad thing.</p><p>I have a question for the Chinese experts. You mentioned Japan and the purchase of real estate that we saw by the Japanese in the late '70s or early '80s. Those purchases led to a tax code provision for foreign investment in real property that generally imposed a 10 percent withholding tax on sales by foreigners of U.S. real estate. Do you anticipate that, if we see a flood of Chinese investment into the U.S., there will be some comparable fear regarding high tech or some other market, and there will be a similar tax code reaction?</p><p>SHOESMITH: Yes.</p><p>LIU: I'm sure that would be the case.</p><p>SHOESMITH: It's partly a political question and partly a cultural question. We're always afraid somebody is taking us over. We're more than twice as large as the next largest economy in the world-which is China-and we're still worried about someone taking us over. Particularly with regard to information technology, infrastructure, and the like.</p><p>RUMBERGER: Regarding the U.S. regulatory landscape, potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations always seem to be an area of concern. Not too long ago, I was representing a private-equity buyer who was acquiring a small, publicly traded software company with most of its sales in Latin America; a year or two earlier, the target company had entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department, and it had a number of penalty payments due for an FCPA violation; after reviewing the decree and conducting further due diligence, our buyer ultimately decided the risks were too great.</p><p>Going back to an observation I made earlier, I would say, even where there may not be a formal overseas subsidiary or foreign operations/sales for a target company, that target company may be using-or have used-an offshore engineering team for some aspect of software development. So foreign legal questions lurk in the background in a lot of tech deals, even early-stage, and particularly those that are software-based, sometimes only concerning whether the target's IP was properly documented and assigned. And that can often be a question of foreign, not just U.S. law.</p><p>LIU: In the age of globalization, we need to be mindful of many laws in other jurisdictions, including the U.K.'s anti-bribery legislation [The Bribery Act of 2010]. If you think the FCPA is difficult, the anti-bribery legislation is even more challenging because certain provisions are completely untested and businesses have no idea how to implement certain provisions which negatively impacts acquirers' ability to do due diligence compliance properly.</p><p>MODERATOR: Let's shift away from the global picture. What are the very early-stage concerns that we hear much less about? Where are things headed in terms of deal structures or the kinds of companies that are coming up?</p><p>RUMBERGER: I started seeing early-stage exits really pick up back in 2009, when a lot of the big tech companies had a mountain of cash on their balance sheets, which they were under some pressure to deploy or dividend back, and I don't think it has slowed down since. Most startups and even venture-backed companies in Silicon Valley are aware that if they do have an exit, it's likely to be by an acquisition, not sale into the public markets. Many founders, particularly in 2009 and '10, liked the idea of getting any exit, any return on their efforts, often only in the single-digit millions (well, at least where they had not taken in much outside investment). They had the security of going into a large enterprise, getting a steady paycheck, healthcare, oh, and a few million bucks in the bank, during a time when the future was far from certain and no one knew whether the double dip was coming or not.</p><p>As for acquisition structure, I would say at less than a $10 million purchase price the big tech acquirers are biased toward structuring it as an asset deal, and in excess of $10 million valuation, they're more willing to structure it as a stock deal (or merger) because of the tax savings involved (and the net result paid to the seller in not having the double layer of tax). I've had a counterintuitive result happen in some very small asset deals where my client, the seller, was a C corp. We were actually trying to push more of the agreed purchase price allocation to the non-compete covenants imposed upon the individual founders by the acquirer because that was going to a single layer of tax versus the actually acquired C corp. assets, which would impose a double layer of tax.</p><p>DOLOBOFF: Welcome to the world of LLCs.</p><p>RUMBERGER: Yes, LLCs are becoming more predominant for startup technology companies. And, when I sit down with an entrepreneur to go through the pluses and minuses of a C corp. versus LLC, it can be a complicated conversation because if there is an exit, and it's a single-versus a double, triple, or homerun-it may very well be an asset sale, and the founders would prefer to be in a \"pass-through\" vehicle like an LLC. So I always want to lay it out and have them make the decision. I would say one in five startups I bring on as new clients might set up initially as an LLC because they can relatively easily convert to a C corp. later.</p><p>DOLOBOFF: And foreign companies that come to the U.S. often want to form a U.S. corporation, because the last thing they want to do is to file a U.S. tax return solely because they have a U.S. branch. An LLC will pay the same amount of U.S. tax, but the foreign parent will have to file a tax return in the U.S., which most foreign companies would rather avoid.</p><p>RUMBERGER: Sometimes the U.S. market is only that, another market to exploit for the non-U.S.company; if, however, they take in U.S. venture capital, it's likely they will need to relocate headquarters here (or \"flip\" the ownership from the foreign company into the U.S.company, which becomes the parent entity). It's the reverse of what many U.S. corporate lawyers are used to; namely, instead of running the deal, coordinating and overseeing local counsel in various overseas jurisdictions where subsidiaries or otherwise material operations are taking place, here the seller's parent company remains non-U.S., and we are just another \"local\" counsel.</p><p>MODERATOR: From the lawyer's perspective, as opposed to the business perspective, in your experience of working in M&amp;A, what's changing now? Can you characterize how the practice itself is changing?</p><p>SHOESMITH: My experience is that large corporations are handling much of their M&amp;A in-house, although they will still go outside for specialized expertise. But there is still a strategic overlay that experienced lawyers can add to a transaction. In due diligence, for example, it is sometimes relatively simple: collect the documents, see what they say, and you're done. But in China, due diligence requires second-order inferences-making judgments based on facts, not just discovering facts. And that requires a level of experience, not just expertise but experience. So for an outside lawyer the trend I see is towards a more strategic role and not just that of a technician.</p><p>RUMBERGER: I recently closed a deal for a primarily foreign-based company buying a Silicon Valley-based software company, and they were looking for our expertise and understanding of the U.S. market and M&amp;A deal term norms, even though they have a significant, experienced, and smart in-house legal team worldwide, including in the U.S. They wanted somebody who understood U.S. (and even California) tech market deal terms to minimize time otherwise spent negotiating for, say, uncapped indemnification or joint and several selling shareholder liability, which may have been the norm in their home jurisdiction, but which would be seen as completely unreasonable by most sellers and their counsel in the U.S. So, I think inbound acquisition work could turn out to be a growing area for California M&amp;A lawyers, a welcome exception to the growing trend of larger acquirers bringing more deal volume in-house.</p><p>A lot of companies outside the U.S. are continuing to get more acquisitive and are acquiring California-born and -based technology and talent as customers in all markets, globally, demand the same cutting-edge technology. These companies want to integrate California DNA into their products and even organizations.</p><p>LIU: Echoing Todd [Rumberger], I started 15 years ago, and one of my first deals was helping a PRC company list on the NASDAQ. So I thought this is great because then I could use my Chinese language skills and cultural background concurrently with my U.S. legal education. Unfortunately, the boom of PRC companies listing in the U.S. has tapered off significantly and with the various high-profile accounting scandals involving listed PRC companies, I am not sure we will see a new wave of Chinese companies listing in the U.S.. So I'm very happy 15 years later to see an increasing trend of more outbound M&amp;A from China.</p><p>DOLOBOFF: I've seen things develop more along the lines outlined by Tom [Shoesmith]. The public company clients that I advise tend to use me repeatedly as special tax counsel. So I get to know the company and to know more or less their strategic goals. Their in-house tax staffs are very sophisticated, and their in-house legal staffs are. So what they do is balance me with other experts and obtain from us exactly what they want-no more, no less.</p><p>SHOESMITH: I find in international transactions, although I do the technical stuff, the place where I really add value is as an adviser. I think the legal profession is going in that direction, and I think that's a good thing.</p><p>RUMBERGER: And, if you do a good job, for a reasonable price (i.e., you're a good value), they're generally going to stick with you. You build a relationship with the founder, CEO, management, even the board. The relationships in the inbound transactions I've worked on have been similar to the relationships I've had with the earlier stage companies-rather than just marking up the purchase agreement and emailing it back and forth with opposing counsel, foreign buyer clients are looking more for strategy and business feedback on deal points. That's more rewarding-and more similar to my early-stage and venture-backed company practice. So back to my theme: The inbound stuff can be great work. n</p><p>Originally published in California Lawyer, August 2013.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Lawmakers grappled with the difficult questions of how and when to regulate AI and sketched out new legal frameworks, bringing into sharper relief the overarching legal issues that are poised to become the subject of protracted debate over the coming year. The policy debate in 2019 was especially characterized by the gulf between sprawling treatises setting out general ethical principles designed to control and mitigate the risks of AIincluding theoretical applications of \"general\" AI1on the one hand, and calls for targeted restrictions on the specific use of certain \"narrow\" domain-specific AI products and applications on the other.</p><p>In the United States, while federal policy remains \"light-touch,\" lawmakers responded to increasing public concern over the perceived dangers of unfettered technological development by proposing a number of high profile draft bills addressing the role of AI and how it should be governed, the real impact of which is yet to be felt across the private sector. U.S. state and local governments pressed forward with concrete legislative proposals regulating the use of AI. Finally, 2019 saw a growing international consensus that AI technology should be subject to certain technical standards and potentially even certification procedures in the same way other technical systems require certification before deployment.</p><p>This inaugural Artificial Intelligence and Automated Systems Annual Legal Review places these, and other, 2019 developments in broader context, focusing on developments within the United States. We also touch, albeit non-exhaustively, on developments within the EU that are of relevance to domestic and international companies alike. The AI policy landscape is vast and fast-evolvingwe do not attempt to address every development that occurred in 2019, but examine a number of the most significant developments affecting companies as they navigate the evolving AI landscape.</p><p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p><p>I.

Labor and Hiring</p><p>I. GLOBAL POLICY DEVELOPMENTS</p><p>The past year saw a number of ambitious projects and guidelines from governments and other intergovernmental bodies around the world aiming to identify shared norms and valuesdescribed by one such initiative as \"holistic definitions of societal prosperity [...] versus [...] one-dimensional goals of increased productivity or gross domestic product\"2in an attempt to reach a global consensus on how to define and then instill an ethical approach into AI development and governance.3 While these recommendations are non-binding and advisory in nature, their potential impact on national policy-making and, ultimately, concrete regulations, should not be underestimated. We offer a brief overview of several of these policy initiatives in order to place legislative, regulatory and policy approaches proposed and enacted by governments and other domestic regulatory bodies in a broader global context.</p><p>A. OECD Recommendations on AI</p><p>On May 21, 2019, the 36 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\"), along with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru and Romania, adopted a set of recommendations on AI referred to as \"Principles of Artificial Intelligence\" (\"Principles\").4 The Principles were drafted by a group of experts comprising experts from different OECD members, disciplines and sectors.5 Intended to represent the first intergovernmental standard for AI policies, they promote five strategies for developing national policy and international cooperation, treading the line between promoting economic improvement and innovation and fostering fundamental values and trust in the development of AI: inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being; human-centered values and fairness; transparency and explainability; robustness, security and safety; and accountability. The Principles are broadly stated and not legally binding, but instead seek to encourage member countries to incorporate these values or ethics in the development of AI.6</p><p>B. Global Partnership on AI</p><p>In May 2019, Canada and France announced plans for a new international body (\"Global Partnership on AI\") for the G7 countries to study and steer the effects of artificial intelligence on the world's people and economies by creating best practices, modeled on the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.7 Although the principles espoused by the Global Partnership would not be legally binding on other governments or private companies, the White House has raised concerns that the approach is too restrictive and duplicates work already being done by the OECD, and has so far declined to participate.8</p><p>C. Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems</p><p>In 2019, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (\"IEEE\") launched the \"Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems\" in order to \"establish societal and policy guidelines in order for such systems to remain human-centric, serving humanity's values and ethical principles.\"9 In an extensive report addressing ethical considerations in the design of AI systems, IEEE applied classical ethics and human rights methodologies to considerations of algorithmic design and articulated eight high-level ethical principles that apply to all types of AI products, regardless of whether they are physical robots or software systems, and that \"define imperatives for the design, development, deployment, adoption, and decommissioning of [AI].\"10 The eight principles are: human rights, human well-being, data agency and control, effectiveness and fitness for purpose, transparency, accountability, awareness of misuse, and operational competence.11</p><p>D. UN Considers Ban on Lethal Autonomous Weapons</p><p>In March 2019, the United Nations (\"UN\") Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres urged restriction on the development of lethal autonomous weapons systems (\"LAWs\"), arguing that machines with the power and discretion to take lives without human involvement are politically unacceptable, morally repugnant and should be prohibited by international law.12 Subsequently, Japan pledged that it will not develop fully automated weapons systems.13 A group of member statesincluding the UK, United States, Russia, Israel and Australiaare reportedly opposed to a preemptive ban in the absence of any international agreement on the characteristics of autonomous weapons, stalling any progress towards a common approach for the time being.14</p><p>II. U.S. NATIONAL POLICY &amp; KEY LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS</p><p>A. U.S. National Policy on AI Takes Shape</p><p>By early 2019, despite its position at the forefront of commercial AI innovation, the United States still lacked an overall federal AI strategy and policy.15 Under increasing pressure from the U.S. technology industry and policy organizations to present a substantive federal AI strategy on AI, over the past 12 months the Trump administration took public actions to prioritize AI and automated systems. Most notably, these pronouncements include President Trump's \"Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence\" Executive Order16 and the subsequently issued guidance to federal regulatory agencies.17 U.S. federal, state and local government agencies also began to show a willingness to take concrete positions on regulation, resulting in a variety of policy approaches - many of which eschew informal guidance and voluntary standards and favor outright technology bans. For the most part, the trend in favor of more individual and nuanced assessments of how best to regulate AI systems specific to their end uses by regulators in the United States has been welcome. Although there is an inherent risk that reactionary legislative responses will result in a disharmonious, fragmented national regulatory framework, such developments will yield important insights into what it means to govern and regulate AI over the coming year.</p><p>1. Executive Order \"Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence\"</p><p>On February 11, 2019, President Trump signed an executive order (\"EO\") titled \"Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence.\"18 The purpose of the EO was to spur the development and regulation of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning and fortify the United States' global position by directing federal agencies to prioritize investments in AI,19 interpreted by many observers to be a response to China's efforts to claim a leadership position in AI research and development.20</p><p>The EO, which was titled 'Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,' outlined five key areas: research and development,21 'unleashing' AI resources,22 establishing AI governance standards, building an AI workforce,23 and international collaboration and protection.24 The AI Initiative is coordinated through the National Science and Technology Council Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (\"NSTC Select Committee\").</p><p>While the EO favors broad principles in line with the administration's \"light-touch\" approach to private sector regulation, AI developers will need to pay close attention to the executive branch's response to standards setting. Aiming to foster public trust in AI by using federal agencies to develop and maintain approaches for safe and trustworthy creation and adoption of new AI technologies (for example, the EO calls on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") to lead the development of appropriate technical standards).25</p><p>In response, in July 2019 NIST sought public comment on a draft plan for federal government engagement in advancing AI standards for U.S. economic and national security needs (\"U.S. Leadership in AI: Plan for Federal Engagement in Developing Technical Standards and Related Tools\").26 The plan recommends four actions: bolster AI standards-related knowledge, leadership and coordination among federal agencies; promote focused research on the \"trustworthiness\" of AI; support and expand public-private partnerships; and engage with international parties.</p><p>The full impact of the AI Initiative is not yet known: while it sets some specific deadlines for formalizing plans by agencies under the direction of the Select Committee, the EO is not self-executing and is generally thin on details. Therefore, the long-term impact will be in the actions recommended and taken as a result of those consultations and reports, not the EO itself.27 Moreover, although the AI Initiative is designed to dedicate resources and funnel investments into AI research, the EO does not set aside specific financial resources or provide details on how available resources will be structured.</p><p>In March 2019, the White House launched ai.gov as a platform to share AI initiatives from the Trump administration and federal agencies.28 These initiatives track along the key points of the AI EO, and ai.gov is intended to function as an ongoing press release, highlighting a number of federal government efforts under the Trump administration (and some launched during the Obama administration): the White House's charting of the NSTC Select Committee on AI, the Department of Energy's efforts to develop supercomputers, the Department of Transportation's efforts to integrate automated driving systems, and the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to assess AI implementation in medical research.29</p><p>2. The GrAITR Act (H.R. 2202)</p><p>The Growing Artificial Intelligence Through Research (GrAITR) Act was introduced in April 2019 to establish a coordinated federal initiative aimed at accelerating AI research and development for US economic and national security and closing the existing funding gap.30 The Act would create a strategic plan to invest $1.6 billion over 10 years in research, development and application of AI across the private sector, academia and government agencies, including NIST, and the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy - aimed at helping the United States catch up to other countries, including the United Kingdom, who are \"already cultivating workforces to create and use AI-enabled devices.\" The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.31</p><p>3. Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act (S. 1558)</p><p>In May 2019, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), and Brian Schatz (D-HI) proposed a companion bill to GrAITR, the Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act, which would attempt to create a national, overarching strategy 'tailored to the US political economy', for developing AI with a $2.2 billion federal investment over the next five years.32 The Act would task branches of the federal government to use AI where possible in operation of its systems. Specifically, it includes the establishment of a national office to coordinate AI efforts across the federal system (National AI Coordination Office), requests that NIST establish ethical standards and identify metrics used to establish standards for evaluating AI algorithms and their effectiveness, as well as the quality of training data sets, and proposes that the National Science Foundation set educational goals for AI and STEM learning.33 Moreover, the bill requires the Department of Energy to create an AI research program, building state-of-the-art computing facilities that will be made available to private sector users on a cost-recovery basis.34 The draft legislation complements the formation of the bipartisan Senate AI Caucus in March 2019 to address transformative technology with implications spanning a number of fields including transportation, healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing and national security.</p><p>4. AI in Government Act (H.R. 2575/S. 3502)</p><p>House Bill 2575 and its corresponding bipartisan Senate Bill 3502 (the \"AI in Government Act\")which would task federal agencies with exploring the implementation of AI in their functions and establishing an \"AI Center of Excellence,\"were first introduced in September 2018, and reintroduced in May 2019.35 The center would be directed to \"study economic, policy, legal, and ethical challenges and implications related to the use of artificial intelligence by the Federal Government\" and \"establish best practices for identifying, assessing, and mitigating any bias on the basis of any classification protected under Federal non-discrimination laws or other negative unintended consequence stemming from the use of artificial intelligence systems.\"</p><p>One of the sponsors of the bill, Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI), stated that \"[o]ur bill will bring agencies, industry, and others to the table to discuss government adoption of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. We need a better understanding of the opportunities and challenges these technologies present for federal government use and this legislation would put us on the path to achieve that goal.\"36 Although the bill is aimed at improving the implementation of AI by the federal government, there are likely to be opportunities for industry stakeholders to participate in discussions surrounding best practices.37</p><p>5. OMB Guidance for Federal Regulatory Agencies</p><p>The EO directed the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\") director, in coordination with the directors of the Office of Science and Technology Police, Domestic Policy Council, and National Economic Council, and in consultation with other relevant agencies and key stakeholders (as determined by OMB), to issue a memorandum to the heads of all agencies to \"inform the development of regulatory and non regulatory approaches\" to AI that \"advance American innovation while upholding civil liberties, privacy, and American values\" and consider ways to reduce barriers to the use of AI technologies in order to promote their innovative application. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy further indicated in April 2019 that regulatory authority will be left to agencies to adjust to their sectors, but with high-level guidance from the OMB, as directed by the EO.38</p><p>In January 2020, the OMB published a draft memorandum featuring 10 \"AI Principles\" and outlining its proposed approach to regulatory guidance for the private sector which echoes the \"light-touch\" regulatory approach espoused by the 2019 EO, noting that promoting innovation and growth of AI is a \"high priority\" and that \"fostering innovation and growth through forbearing from new regulations may be appropriate.\"39 The guidance directs federal agencies to \"avoid regulatory or non-regulatory actions that needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth\" and notes that in certain circumstances it may be appropriate to preempt \"inconsistent, burdensome and duplicative State laws,\" although it also cautions that agencies should consider forgoing regulatory action where a \"uniform national standard for a specific aspect related to AI is not essential.\"40 As expected, the principles favor flexible regulatory frameworks that allow for rapid change and updates across sectors, rather than one-size-fits-all regulations, and urge European lawmakers to avoid heavy regulation frameworks. The guidance encourages federal agencies to provide opportunities for public comment in AI rulemaking.</p><p>The principles also address some of the concerns raised by commentators with regard to ethics and particularly unwanted bias, urging lawmakers to consider whether the technology will \"introduce real-world bias that produces discriminatory outcomes\" and advising agencies to pursue transparency by disclosing the use of AI technology and making sure that outcomes are sufficiently transparent to ensure that the algorithms comply with existing laws.</p><p>6. National Security and Military Use</p><p>In the last few years, the US federal government has been very active in coordinating cross-agency leadership and planning for bolstering continued research and development of artificial intelligence technologies for use by the government itself. Along these lines, a principle focus for a number of key legislative and executive actions was the growth and development of such technologies for national security and military uses.</p><p>As a result of the passing of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for 2019 (the 2019 NDAA),41 the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence was established to study current advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and their potential application to national security and military uses. In addition, in response to the 2019 NDAA, the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (\"JAIC\") as a vehicle for developing and executing an overall AI strategy, and named its director to oversee the coordination of this strategy for the military.42 While these actions clearly indicate an interest in ensuring that advanced technologies like AI also benefit the US military and intelligence communities, the limited availability of funding from Congress may hinder the ability of these newly formed entities to fully accomplish their stated goals.</p><p>The JAIC is becoming the key focal point for the DoD in executing its overall AI strategy. As set out in a February 2019 summary of AI strategy provided by the DoD,43 the JAIC will work with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (\"DARPA\"),44 various DoD laboratories, and other entities within the DoD to not only identify and deliver AI-enabled capabilities for national defense, but also to establish ethical guidelines for the development and use of AI by the military.45 However, JAIC's efforts to be a leader in defining ethical uses of AI in military applications may prove challenging because one of the most hotly debated uses of AI is in connection with autonomous weaponry.46 As this Review went to press, the White House released its 2021 budget request to Congress, which proposed a funding windfall for AI-related research and development, particularly in the military sector.47</p><p>On October 31, 2019, the Defense Innovation Board (\"DIB\"), an independent federal advisory committee to the Pentagon consisting of a group of science and technology expertsled by former Google CEO Eric Schmidtproposed a new ethics framework consisting of five overarching ethical principles which tie the DoD existing laws of war and rules of engagement48 into the use of AI.49 The report is a high-level blueprint for military deployments of artificial intelligence and addresses some general shortcomings of AI technology.50 The principles advocate for deliberate AI designs to counter unintended biases that could cause inadvertent harm and for humans to have the power to deactivate or disengage AI systems acting outside the intended parameters. The DIB also suggested that humans should always be responsible for the \"development, deployment, use and outcomes\" of AI rather than letting AI set its own standards of use. In these cases, DoD should not use that AI system because \"it does not achieve mission objectives in an ethical or responsible manner.\"51</p><p>The DIB also recommended a number of technical and organizational measures that would help lay the groundwork to ensure military artificial intelligence systems adhere to ethical standards, such as increasing investment in standards development, workforce programs and AI security applications, and formalizing channels for exploring the ethical implications of deploying AI technology across the department. The newly proposed ethics framework could help address private sector concerns about innovative technology being wrongly weaponized or misused by the military or being part of autonomous systems without sufficient human oversight.</p><p>a) The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan: 2019 Update</p><p>Three years after the release of the initial National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, in June 2019 the Trump administration issued an updatepreviewed in the EObringing forward the original seven focus areas and adding an eighth: public-private partnerships.52 The update highlights the benefits of strategically leveraging academic and industry expertise, including facilities, datasets, and expertise, to advance science and engineering innovations. Companies interested in exploring the possibility of individual collaborations or joint programs advancing precompetitive research should consider whether they have relevant expertise in any of the areas in which federal agencies are actively pursuing public-private partnerships, including the DoD's Defense Innovation Unit and the Department of Health and Human Services.53</p><p>b) NSCAI Report on U.S. National Security</p><p>On November 4, 2019, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (\"NSCAI\")which was tasked by Congress to research ways to advance the development of AI for national security and defense purposesreleased a highly anticipated interim report specifying five key areas in which U.S. policy can improve in order to transition AI from \"a promising technological novelty into a mature technology integrated into core national security missions.\"54 The commission worked with a number of U.S. government departments and agencies including the intelligence community, academia and the private sector, as well as allied partners such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and Australia. Across all five principles, NSCAI said that ethical and responsible development and deployment of AI is a top priority, and noted that it is still developing best practices for operationalizing AI technologies that are trustworthy, explainable, and free of unwanted bias. The five lines of effort are: invest in research and development; apply the technology to national security missions; train and recruit AI talent; protect and build upon U.S. technology advantages; and marshal global cooperation on artificial intelligence issues.</p><p>The commission's preliminary conclusion is that the U.S. \"is not translating broad national AI strengths and AI strategy statements into specific national security advantages.\"55 Notably, the commission reported that federal R&amp;D funding has not kept pace with the potential of AI technologies, noting that the requested fiscal year 2020 federal funding for core AI research outside of the defense sector grew by less than 2 percent from the estimated 2019 levels.56 Further, it noted that AI is not realizing its potential to execute core national security missions because agencies are failing to embrace the technology as a result of \"bureaucratic impediments and inertia.\"57 NSCAI also criticized the shortage of AI talent in government agencies, specifically in the Department of Defense (\"DoD\"). It made workforce development recommendations to federal agencies, including undertaking more widespread use of AI technologies, and improving training on basic AI principles.58 The commission asserted that the U.S. has a global technological advantage in terms of AI implementation, but also warned that China is rapidly closing the gap.59 NSCAI recommended export controls to protect AI hardware,60 and preservation of an open research system with U.S. academia. Finally, the commission said the U.S. should lead creation of AI norms worldwide by fostering international collaboration and establishing a network of allies dedicated to AI data sharing, R&amp;D coordination, capacity building, and talent exchanges.</p><p>NSCAI is set to release its final report and recommendationswhich will likely contain additional insights into U.S. federal policy regarding AIin March 2021.</p><p>B. U.S. Imposes Export Controls Related to AI</p><p>On October 7, 2019, the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (\"BIS\") announced that it will add 28 Chinese governmental and commercial organizations to the Entity List for engaging in or enabling activities contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States.61 The regulation includes China's leading AI companies, including Sense Time, Megvii Technology, Yitu, and Dahua Technology. Companies are required to comply with the notice as of the effective date, although it includes a standard \"savings clause\" exempting items that are already en route as of October 9, 2019. The Secretary of Commerce stated that this action was in response to \"the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China[.]\"62</p><p>On January 3, 2020, BIS also announced its first unilateral control on a specific application of AI in software that automates certain data analysis of geospatial imagery data.63 The United States has previously imposed controls on certain enabling technologies for AI in concert with other countries that participate in multilateral export control regimes. However, this is the first new AI control imposed by BIS since it began evaluating potential controls on AI as one of among several types of emerging or foundational technologies pursuant to congressionally imposed mandate in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018.</p><p>While BIS has indicated in many public fora that it will strive to ensure that any new controls it may impose on emerging and foundational technologies like AI are also adopted in peer countries that participate in the Wassenaar Arrangement, among other multilateral export regimes, the development of international consensus around specific controls often requires years of outreach and negotiation. Likely due to the significant national security-related concerns associated with development of AI-enabled, automated geospatial data analysis software, BIS opted to act unilaterally now. The specific software now subject to controls is described under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 0D521. Effective immediately, all exports of the software to countries worldwide (except Canada) and will now require an individual license from BIS. Moreover, releases of the software in source code to non-U.S. persons, for example, non-U.S. person employees, also require licensing. The only exception for the new license requirement is for exports of the software when transferred by or to a department or agency of the U.S. Government. In addition to these new licensing requirements, BIS's control of the software under the new ECCN makes the software a kind of critical technology for the purposes of foreign investment review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\"CFIUS\").</p><p>III. EU POLICY &amp; REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS</p><p>In 2019, the European Union (\"EU\") announced that it was preparing comprehensive legislation to govern AI, took steps to demonstrate its commitment toward the advancement of AI technology through funding,64 while simultaneously pressing for companies and governments to develop ethical applications of AI. As we have addressed previously,65 given the stringent requirements of the European General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), future EC regulations are likely to stand in contrast to the current U.S. \"light-touch\" regulatory approach and could have a significant impact on companies developing or operating AI products within the EU. Given that the U.S. and China currently lead the global AI race in terms of technological advancement, the \"regulate-first\" approach of the European Union (\"EU\") has led to concerns that it will impede innovation within the EU.66</p><p>A. EC Focus on Comprehensive AI Regulation</p><p>In mid-2019, the new president of the European Commission (\"EC\"), Ursula von der Leyen, unveiled her five-year policy agenda and promised to put forward legislation \"for a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of AI\" by March 2020.67</p><p>In a speech at the European Parliament on November 27, 2019, von der Leyen said that she was in favor of AI-focused legislation similar to the GDPR.68 The Commission is also likely to draw on the work of its high-level expert group on AI, which outlined a series of principles earlier this year aimed at ensuring companies deploy artificial intelligence in a way that is fair, safe and accountable. In January 2020, a leaked draft of a white paper noted that the EC was considering a five-year ban on the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces, although recent press reports indicate that the EC has since scrapped the possibility of a ban.69 The draft also suggested that the EU's executive body is in fact leaning towards tweaks of existing rules and sector/application-specific risk assessments and requirements, rather than blanket sectoral requirements or bans.70 The proposal also emphasizes the need for an oversight governance regime to ensure rules are followedthough the Commission suggested leaving Member States to choose whether to rely on existing governance bodies for this task or create new ones dedicated to regulating AI. The revised proposal, part of a package of measures to address the challenges of AI, could still be amended before the Commission presents its plan on February 19, 2020.</p><p>On the basis of these statements, we anticipate that the AI legislation will:</p><p>(1) be comprehensive and sweeping in nature, aiming to address fundamental questions at a more abstract level (similar to the GDPR);</p><p>(2) be focused on individual rights (including information rights) and require GDPR-style impact assessments to ensure AI systems do not perpetuate discrimination or violate fundamental rights;</p><p>(3) address government funding of research, workplace training and the availability of public data;</p><p>(4) require, like some U.S. statesnotably Californiathat any chatbot or virtual assistant interacting with individuals will need to disclose that it is not a human, and create enhanced requirements for transparency as to the use of data and the bases for decisions or recommendations to avoid unintended bias or disparate impact; and</p><p>(5) contain rules for accountability, mitigation of bias and discrimination, liability and transparency throughout the entire life cycle of a product or service.71</p><p>The legislative initiative is part of a bigger effort to secure a competitive advantage and to increase public and private investment in AI to 20 billion per year.72 A key challenge for the new president of the EC von der Leyen will be to grow investment, data, and talent required to develop AI and accelerate its adoption, and to create an innovation-friendly regulatory environment across the EU.</p><p>B. Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI</p><p>Another focus of regulatory activity within the EU and individual EU Member States has been the development of ethical considerations in the use of AI. In connection with the implementation of the GDPR in 2018, in April 2019, the EC released a report from its \"High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence\" (\"AI HLEG\"): the EU \"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI\" (\"Ethics Guidelines\").73 The Ethics Guidelines lay out seven ethical principles \"that must be respected in the development, deployment, and use of AI systems\":</p><p>(1) Human Agency and Oversight: AI systems should enable equitable societies by supporting human agency and fundamental rights, and not decrease, limit or misguide human autonomy.</p><p>(2) Robustness and Safety: Trustworthy AI requires algorithms to be secure, reliable and robust enough to deal with errors or inconsistencies during all life cycle phases of AI systems.</p><p>(3) Privacy and Data Governance: Citizens should have full control over their own data, while data concerning them will not be used to harm or discriminate against them.</p><p>(4) Transparency: The traceability of AI systems should be ensured.</p><p>(5) Diversity, Non-Discrimination and Fairness: AI systems should consider the whole range of human abilities, skills and requirements, and ensure accessibility.</p><p>(6) Societal and Environmental Well-Being: AI systems should be used to enhance positive social change and enhance sustainability and ecological responsibility.</p><p>(7) Accountability: Mechanisms should be put in place to ensure responsibility and accountability for AI systems and their outcomes.</p><p>In addition, the Ethics Guidelines highlight the importance of implementing a \"large-scale pilot with partners\" and of \"building international consensus for human-centric AI,\"74 and contain an \"assessment list\" which operationalizes the ethical principles and offers guidance to implement them in practice.75 Along with the release of the Ethics Guidelines, the EC initiated a pilot phase of guideline implementation to assess the practical implementation of the assessment list and to gather feedback on how it can be improved.76 Following the end of the piloting phase in December 2019, the AI HLEG will evaluate the feedback received and propose a revised version of the assessment list to the EC in early 2020.77</p><p>The EU also intends to \"continue to play an active role in international discussions and initiatives including the G7 and G20.\"78 While the Guidelines do not appear to create any binding regulation on stakeholders in the EU, their further development and evolution will likely shape the final version of future regulation throughout the EU and therefore merits continued attention.</p><p>C. German Data Ethics Commission Report</p><p>On October 23, 2019, Germany's Data Ethics Commission (\"Ethics Commission\") released a landmark 240-page report containing 75 recommendations for regulating data, algorithmic systems and AI.79 Consistent with EC President Ursula von der Leyen's recent remarks, the report suggests that EU regulation of AI may mirror the approach espoused in the GDPRbroad in scope, focused on individual rights and corporate accountability, and \"horizontally\" applicable across industries, rather than specific sectors.80 Expanding on the EU's non-binding \"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI,\" the commission concludes that \"regulation is necessary, and cannot be replaced by ethical principles.\"81</p><p>The report creates a blueprint for the implementation of binding legal rules for AInominally both at national and EU levelon a sliding scale based on the risk of harm across five levels of algorithmic systems, with a focus on the degree of potential harm rather than differentiating between specific use cases. While systems posing a negligible or low likelihood of harm would not require any new regulatory obligations, those with at least \"some\" potential for harm would be subject to a mandatory labeling scheme that indicates where and how algorithms are being used within the system, and a risk assessment that evaluates the system's effect on privacy rights, self-determination, bodily or personal integrity, assets and ownership rights, and discrimination, among other factors. For systems that curate content based on user data, such as personalized pricing algorithms, the commission recommends prior authorization by supervisory institutions, and heightened oversight (such as live monitoring) and transparency obligations systems with \"regular or significant potential for harm,\" which include determinations about consumer creditworthiness. The commission recommended a full or partial ban on systems with an \"untenable potential for harm.\"82</p><p>Of particular relevance to companies deploying AI software, the Ethics Commission recommends that measures be taken against \"ethically indefensible uses of data,\" such as \"total surveillance, profiling that poses a threat to personal integrity, the targeted exploitation of vulnerabilities, addictive designs and dark patterns, methods of influencing political elections that are incompatible with the principle of democracy, vendor lock-in and systematic consumer detriment, and many practices that involve trading in personal data.\"83 The Ethics Commission also recommends that human operators of algorithmic systems be held vicariously liable for any harm caused by autonomous technology, and calls for an overhaul of existing product liability and strict liability laws as they pertain to algorithmic products and services.84</p><p>While the report's pro-regulation approach is a counterweight to the \"light-touch\" regulation favored by the U.S. government, the Ethics Commission takes the view that, far from impeding private sector innovation, regulation can provide much-needed certainty to companies developing, testing, and deploying innovative AI products.85 Certainly, the Ethics Commission's guiding principlesamong them the need to ensure \"the human-centred and value-oriented design of technology\"86reinforce that European lawmakers are likely to regulate AI development comprehensively and decisively. While it remains to be seen to what extent the forthcoming draft EU legislation will adopt the commission's recommendations, all signs point to a sweeping regulatory regime that could significantly impact technology companies active in the EU.</p><p>IV. REGULATION OF AI TECHNOLOGIES AND ALGORITHMS</p><p>As the use of AI expands into different sectors and the need for data multiplies, legislation that traditionally has not focused on AI is starting to have a growing impact on AI technology development. Defining and achieving an ethical approach to AI decision-making has been at the forefront of policy discussions relating to the private sector for some time, and the deep learning community has responded with a wave of investments and initiatives focusing on processes designed to assess and mitigate bias and disenfranchisement87 at risk of becoming \"baked in and scaled\" by AI systems.88 Such discussions are now becoming more urgent and nuanced with the increased availability of AI decision-making tools allowing government decisions to be delegated to algorithms to improve accuracy and drive objectivity, directly impacting democracy and governance.89 Over the past year, we have seen those discussions evolve into tangible and impactful legislative proposals and concrete regulations in the data regulation space and, notably, several outright technology bans.90</p><p>A. Algorithmic Accountability</p><p>In 2019, a number of federal bills addressing algorithmic accountability and transparency hinted at a shift in Washington's stance amid growing public awareness of AI's potential to create bias or harm certain groups.91 While the proposed legislation remains in its early stages, it is indicative of the government's increasingly bold engagement with technological innovation and the regulation of AI, and companies operating in this space should remain alert to both opportunities and risks arising out of federal legislative and policy developmentsparticularly the increasing availability of public-private partnershipsduring 2020.</p><p>1. H.R. 153</p><p>In February 2019, the House introduced Resolution 153 , with the intent of \"[s]upporting the development of guidelines for ethical development of artificial intelligence\" and emphasizing the \"far-reaching societal impacts of AI\" as well as the need for AI's \"safe, responsible, and democratic development.\"92 Similar to California's adoption last year of the Asilomar Principles93 and the OECD's recent adoption of five \"democratic\" AI principles,94 the House Resolution provides that the guidelines must be consonant with certain specified goals, including \"transparency and explainability,\" \"information privacy and the protection of one's personal data,\" \"accountability and oversight for all automated decisionmaking,\" and \"access and fairness.\" This Resolution puts ethics at the forefront of policy, which differs from other legislation that considers ethics only as an ancillary topic. Yet, while this resolution signals a call to action by the government to come up with ethical guidelines for the use of AI technology, the details and scope of such ethical regulations remain unclear.</p><p>2. Algorithmic Accountability Act</p><p>On April 10, 2019, a number of Senate Democrats introduced the \"Algorithmic Accountability Act,\" which \"requires companies to study and fix flawed computer algorithms that result in inaccurate, unfair, biased or discriminatory decisions impacting Americans.\"95 Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) introduced a companion bill in the House.96 The bill stands to be the United States Congress's first serious foray into the regulation of AI and the first legislative attempt in the United States to impose regulation on AI systems in general, as opposed to regulating a specific technology area. The bill reflects a step back from the previously favored approach of industry self-regulation, since it would force companies to actively monitor use of any potentially discriminatory algorithms. Although it does not provide for a private right of action or enforcement by state attorneys general, it would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to enforce and regulate these audit procedures and requirements. Further congressional action on this subject can certainly be anticipated.</p><p>The bill casts a wide net, such that many technology companies would find common practices to fall within the purview of the Act. The Act would not only regulate AI systems but also any \"automated decision system,\" which is broadly defined as any \"computational process, including one derived from machine learning, statistics, or other data processing or artificial intelligence techniques, that makes a decision or facilitates human decision making, that impacts consumers.\"97 For processes within the definition, companies would be required to audit for bias and discrimination and take corrective action to resolve these issues, when identified. The bill would allow regulators to take a closer look at any \"[h]igh-risk automated decision system\"those that involve \"privacy or security of personal information of consumers[,]\" \"sensitives aspects of [consumers'] lives, such as their work performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, behavior, location, or movements[,]\" \"a significant number of consumers regarding race [and several other sensitive topics],\" or \"systematically monitors a large, publicly accessible physical place[.]\"98 For these \"high-risk\" topics, regulators would be permitted to conduct an \"impact assessment\" and examine a host of proprietary aspects relating to the system. Additional regulations will be needed to give these key terms meaning but, for now, the bill is a harbinger for AI regulation that identifies key areas of concern for lawmakers.</p><p>Although the bill still faces an uncertain future, if it is enacted, businesses would face a number of challenges, not least significant uncertainty in defining and, ultimately, seeking to comply with the proposed requirements for implementing \"high risk\" AI systems and utilizing consumer data, as well as the challenges of sufficiently explaining to the FTC the operation of their AI systems. Moreover, the bill expressly states that it does not preempt state lawand states that have already been developing their own consumer privacy protection laws would likely object to any attempts at federal preemptionpotentially creating a complex patchwork of federal and state rules.99 At a minimum, companies operating in this space should certainly anticipate further congressional action on this subject in the near future, and proactively consider how their own \"high-risk\" systems may raise concerns related to bias.</p><p>3. Bot Disclosure and Accountability Act (S. 2125)</p><p>The Bot Disclosure and Accountability Act, first introduced on June 25, 2018 and reintroduced on July 16, 2019, mandates that the FTC come up with regulations that force digital platforms to publicly disclose their use of an 'automated software program or process intended to replicate human activity online'.100 It also prohibits political candidates or parties from using these automated software programs in order to share or disseminate any information targeting political elections. The Act hands the task of defining 'automated software program' to the FTC, which leaves wide latitude in interpretation beyond the narrow bot purpose for which the bill is intended.</p><p>At the state level, California passed a bill in September 2018, the 'Bolstering Online Transparency Act',101 which was the first of its kind and (similar to the federal bot bill) is intended to combat malicious bots operating on digital platforms. This state law does not attempt to ban bots outright, but requires companies to disclose whether they are using a bot to communicate with the public on their internet platforms. The law went into effect on July 1, 2019.</p><p>4. Filter Bubble Transparency Act (S. 2763)</p><p>On October 31, 2019 a bipartisan group of senators introduced the Filter Bubble Transparency Act, the first substantive federal bill aimed at regulating algorithmic control of content on internet platforms. If enacted, the bill would require large-scale internet platforms to provide greater transparency to consumers by providing clear notice on the use, and enabling consumers to opt out, of personalized content curated by \"opaque\" algorithms so that they can \"engage with a platform without being manipulated by algorithms driven by user-specific data\"102 and \"simply opt out of the filter bubble.\"103 \"Filter bubble\" refers to a zone of potential manipulation that exists within algorithms that curate or rank content in internet platforms based on user-specific data, potentially creating digital \"echo chambers.\"104</p><p>The proposed legislation covers \"any public-facing website, internet application, or mobile application,\" such as social network sites, video sharing services, search engines and content aggregation services,105 and generally would prohibit the use of opaque algorithms on platforms without those platforms having first provided notice in a \"clear, conspicuous manner on the platform whenever the user interacts with an opaque algorithm for the first time.\" The term \"opaque algorithm\" is defined as \"an algorithmic ranking system106 that determines the order or manner that information is furnished to a user on a covered internet platform based, in whole or part, on user-specific data that was not expressly provided by the user to the platform\" in order to interact with it.107 Examples of \"user-specific\" data include the user's history of web searches and browsing, geographical locations, physical activity, device interaction, and financial transactions.108 Conversely, data that was expressly provided to the platform by the user for the purpose of interacting with the platformsuch as search terms, saved preferences, an explicitly entered geographical location or the user's social media profiles109is considered \"user-supplied.\"</p><p>Additionally, the bill requires that users be given the option to choose to view content based on \"input-transparent algorithms,\" a purportedly generic algorithmic ranking system that \"does not use the user-specific data of a user to determine the order or manner that information is furnished to such user on a covered platform,\"110 and be able to easily switch between the opaque and the input-transparent versions.111 By way of example, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), another co-sponsor of the bill, explained that \"this legislation would give consumers the choice to decide whether they want to use the algorithm or view content in the order it was posted.\"112 However, there is nothing in the bill that would require platforms to disclose the use of algorithms unless they are using hyper-personal \"user-specific\" data for customization, and even \"input-transparent\" algorithms using \"user-supplied\" data would not necessarily show content in chronological order. Nor would platforms be required to disclose any source code or explain how the algorithms used work. As drafted, the bill's goals of providing transparency and protecting consumers from algorithmic manipulation by \"opting out\" of personalized content appear to be overstated, and lawmakers will need to grapple with the proposed definitions to clarify the scope of the bill's provisions.113</p><p>Like the Algorithmic Accountability Act, the bill is squarely targeted at \"Big Tech\" platformsit would not apply to platforms wholly owned, controlled and operated by a person that did not employ more than 500 employees in the past six months, averaged less than $50 million in annual gross receipts, and annually collects or processes personal data of less than a million individuals.114 Violations of the Act would be enforced with civil penalties by the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") but, unlike the Algorithmic Accountability Act, the bill does not grant state attorneys general the right to bring civil suits for violations, nor expressly state that its provisions do not preempt state laws.115</p><p>B. Facial Recognition Software</p><p>Biometric surveillance, or \"facial recognition technology,\" has emerged as a lightning rod for public debate regarding the risk of improper algorithmic bias and data privacy concerns. Until recently, there were few if any laws or guidelines governing the use of facial recognition technology. Amid widespread fears that the current state of the technology is not sufficiently accurate or reliable to avoid discrimination, regulators have seized the opportunity to act in the AI spaceproposing and passing outright bans on the use of facial recognition technology with no margin for discretion or use case testing while a broader regulatory approach develops and the technology evolves.116 This tentative consensus stands in stark contrast to the generally permissive approach to the development of AI systems in the private sector to date. While much of the regulatory activity to date has been at the local level, momentum is also building for additional regulatory actions at both the state and federal levels.</p><p>1. Federal Regulation</p><p>The federal government has indicated a willingness to consider a nationwide ban on facial recognition technology, or at least to enact stringent regulations. A bill introduced in Congress in March 2019 (S. 847, \"Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act of 2019\") would ban users of commercial face recognition technology from collecting and sharing data for identifying or tracking consumers without their consent, although it does not address the government's uses of the technology.117 With few exceptions, the bill would require facial recognition technology available online to be made accessible for independent third-party testing \"for accuracy and bias.\" The bill remains pending and has been referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.</p><p>Several other federal bills on facial recognition technology have been proposed. H.R. 3875 was introduced on July 22, 2019, to \"prohibit Federal funding from being used for the purchase or use of facial recognition technology.\"118 On July 25, 2019, Representatives Yvette Clark (D-NY), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) introduced the \"No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act.\" If passed, the bill would prohibit facial recognition in public housing units that receive Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") funding. It would also require HUD to submit a report on facial recognition and its impacts on public housing units and tenants.119 Also on July 25, 2019, the Facial, Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation (\"FACE\") Protection Act of 2019 (H.R. 4021) was introduced to prohibit a federal agency from applying \"facial recognition technology to any photo identification issued by a State or the Federal Government or any other photograph otherwise in the possession of a State or the Federal Government unless the agency has obtained a Federal court order determining that there is probable cause for the application of such technology.\"120</p><p>The House Committee on Oversight and Reform has held several hearings on transparency regarding government use cases, at which Committee members voiced strong bipartisan support for providing transparency and accountability to the use of facial recognition technology.121 To date, the group is continuing to work on legislation that could regulate the use of facial recognition by the private sector, federal government, and law enforcement. On January 15, 2020, the House Oversight and Reform Committee held its third hearing in less than a year about facial recognition, this time to explore its use in the private sector.122</p><p>2. State and Local Regulations</p><p>In 2019, lawmakers in numerous states introduced bills to ban or delay the use of facial recognition technology by government agencies or the private sector. In September 2019, California lawmakers passed legislation (A.B. 1215) which places a three-year moratorium on any facial recognition technology used in police body cameras beginning January 1, 2020.123 The bill by Assemblyman Phil Ting (D-San Francisco), which was co-sponsored by the ACLU, was signed into law by Governor Newsom on October 8, 2019.124 Previously, the ACLU had run demonstrations using facial-recognition technology which falsely flagged 26 California lawmakers as matching arrest photos.125</p><p>The language of A.B. 1215 states that using biometric surveillance violates constitutional rights because it is the \"functional equivalent\" of requiring people to carry identification at all times.126 The new law further regulates the collection of personal information, sounds in California's concern for overly broad collection of information, and may influence modifications to the California Consumer Privacy Act 2018 (\"CCPA\") regarding facial recognition (such as A.B. 1281, which would require businesses to give conspicuous notices where facial recognition technology is employed).</p><p>Amid increasing public concern about the technology operating in public spaces, 2019 also saw a string of efforts by various cities in the U.S. to ban the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement.127 Oakland City Council passed an ordinance to ban its use by city police and other government departments, joining San Francisco, California and Somerville, Massachusetts who had already enacted similar bans.128 Berkeley City Council also adopted a ban at a meeting in mid-October 2019.129</p><p>C. Deepfake technology</p><p>A new AI application called \"deepfakes\" is raising a set of challenging policy, technology, and legal issues. Deepfake technology is used to combine and superimpose existing images and videos onto source images or videoscreating new \"synthetic\" images or videosby using a machine learning technique known as a generative adversarial network (\"GAN\"), a deep neural net architecture comprised of two nets, pitting one against the other (the \"adversarial\"). Since GANs can learn to mimic any distribution of data (images, music, speech, or text), the applications of deepfake technology are vast. Prompted by increased public concern over the potential impact of the technology on everything from cybersecurity to electoral manipulation, tentative federal bills intended to regulate deepfakes have emerged over the past several months, while state legislatures have already reacted by banning certain deepfake applications.130</p><p>1. Federal Regulatory Efforts</p><p>In September 2018, Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) and Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) sent a letter to the Director of National Intelligence to warn of potential risks relating to deepfakes.131 The lawmakers cautioned that \"[d]eep fakes have the potential to disrupt every facet of our society and trigger dangerous international and domestic consequences . . . [a]s with any threat, our Intelligence Community must be prepared to combat deep fakes, be vigilant against them, and stand ready to protect our nation and the American people.\"132 In the wake of a June 2019 hearing by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on the national security challenges of artificial intelligence, manipulated media, and deepfake technology, both the House and the Senate introduced legislation to regulate GANs. At present, however, the bills appear to do very little to restrict the use of deepfake technology, suggesting that Congress remains in \"learning mode.\"</p><p>On July 9, 2019, Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) introduced the \"Deepfake Report Act\" (S. 2065), which would require the Department of Homeland Security to submit five annual reports to Congress on the state of the \"digital content forgery\" technology and evaluate available methods of detecting and mitigating threats.133 The reports will include assessments of how the technology can be used to harm national security as well as potential counter measures. The bill defines digital content forgery as \"the use of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, to fabricate or manipulate audio, visual, or text content with the intent to mislead.\" The bipartisan bill was passed in the Senate by unanimous consent on October 25 and is currently before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which is reviewing the same-named companion bill, H.R. 3600.134</p><p>In the House, H.R. 3230 (\"Defending Each and Every Person from False Appearances by Keeping Exploitation Subject to Accountability Act\" or the \"DEEPFAKES Act\") was introduced by Rep. Clarke (D-NY-9) on June 12, 2019.135 It would require any \"advanced technological false personation record\" to be digitally watermarked. The watermark would be required to \"clearly identifying such record as containing altered audio or visual elements.\" The bill has been referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.</p><p>On September 17, 2019, Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH) introduced the \"Identifying Outputs of Generative Adversarial Networks Act\" (H.R. 4355), which would direct both the National Science Foundation and NIST to support research on deepfakes to accelerate the development of technologies that could help improve their detection, to issue a joint report on research opportunities with the private sector, and to consider the feasibility of ongoing public and private sector engagement to develop voluntary standards for the outputs of GANs or comparable technologies.136</p><p>2. State Regulatory Efforts</p><p>In the wake of a June 2019 hearing by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on the national security challenges of artificial intelligence, manipulated media, and deepfake technology, both the House and the Senate introduced legislation to regulate deepfakes.</p><p>While those bills remains pending, California has taken action to restrict the specific use of deepfakes to influence elections and non-consensual pornographic deepfakes. On October 3, 2019 California's Gov. Newsom signed a bill (A.B. 730) banning anyone \"from distributing with actual malice materially deceptive audio or visual media of the candidate\" within 60 days of an election with the intent to injure the candidate's reputation or deceive a voter into voting for or against the candidate.137 This measure exempts print and online media and websites if that entity clearly discloses that the deepfake video or audio file is inaccurate or of questionable authenticity. On October 3, Gov. Newsom also signed a bill (A.B. 602) banning pornographic deepfakes made without consent of the person depicted, creating a private right of action.138 The law excepts \"[c]ommentary, criticism, or disclosure that is otherwise protected by the California Constitution or the United States Constitution.\"</p><p>These laws may signal state regulators' willingness to quickly regulate other controversial AI applications going forward. It will remain to be seen whether these laws will be challenged and whether they will pass constitutional muster. Regardless, the use and proliferation of deepfakes will likely face greater legal and regulatory scrutiny at both federal and state level going forward, and may impact technology platforms which permit users to upload, share or link content.</p><p>D. Autonomous Vehicles</p><p>1. Federal Developments</p><p>There was a flurry of legislative activity in Congress in 2017 and early 2018 towards a national regulatory framework. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution (SELF DRIVE) Act (H.R. 3388)139 by voice vote in September 2017, but its companion bill (the American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies (AV START) Act (S. 1885)),140 stalled in the Senate as a result of holds from Democratic senators who expressed concerns that the proposed legislation remains immature and underdeveloped in that it \"indefinitely\" preempts state and local safety regulations even in the absence of federal standards.141 Federal regulation of autonomous vehicles (\"AVs\") has so far faltered in the new Congress, as SELF DRIVE Act and the AV START Act have not been re-introduced since expiring with the close of the 115th Congress.142</p><p>In 2019, federal lawmakers have demonstrated renewed interest in a comprehensive AV bill aimed at speeding up the adoption of autonomous vehicles and deploying a regulatory framework. In July 2019, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate Commerce Committee sought stakeholder input from the self-driving car industry in order to draft a bipartisan and bicameral AV bill, prompting stakeholders to provide feedback to the committees on a variety of issues involving autonomous vehicles, including cybersecurity, privacy, disability access, and testing expansion.143 Moreover, several federal agencies have announced proposed rulemaking to facilitate the integration of autonomous vehicles onto public roads. And while federal regulations are lagging behind, legislative activity at the state and local level is stepping up to advance integration of autonomous vehicles in the national transportation system and local infrastructure.</p><p>In the meantime, AVs continue to operate under a complex patchwork of state and local rules, with federal oversight limited to the U.S. Department of Transportation's (\"DoT\") informal guidance. In January 2020, the DoT published updated guidance for the regulation of the autonomous vehicle industry, \"Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies\" or \"AV 4.0.\"144 The guidance builds on the AV 3.0 guidance released in October 2018, which introduced guiding principles for AV innovation for all surface transportation modes, and described the DoT's strategy to address existing barriers to potential safety benefits and progress.145 AV 4.0 includes 10 principles to protect consumers, promote markets and ensure a standardized federal approach to AVs. In line with previous guidance, the report promises to address legitimate public concerns about safety, security, and privacy without hampering innovation, relying strongly on the industry self-regulating. However, the report also reiterates traditional disclosure and compliance standards that companies leveraging emerging technology should continue to follow.</p><p>During 2019, several federal agencies announced proposed rule-making to facilitate the integration of autonomous vehicles onto public roads. In May 2019, in the wake of a petition filed by General Motors requesting temporary exemption from Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) which require manual controls or have requirements that are specific to a human driver,146 NHTSA announced that it was seeking comments about the possibility of removing 'regulatory barriers' relating to the introduction of automated vehicles in the United States.147 It is likely that regulatory changes to testing procedures (including preprogrammed execution, simulation, use of external controls, use of a surrogate vehicle with human controls and technical documentation) and modifications to current FMVSSs (such as crashworthiness, crash avoidance and indicator standards) will be finalized in 2021.</p><p>2. State Developments</p><p>State regulatory activity has continued to accelerate, adding to the already complex patchwork of regulations that apply to companies manufacturing and testing autonomous vehicles. State regulations vary significantly, ranging from allowing testing under certain specific and confined conditions to the more extreme, which allow for testing and operating AVs with no human passenger behind the wheel. Recognizing that AVs and vehicles with semi-autonomous components are already being tested and deployed on roads amid legislative gridlock at the federal level, 44 states and the District of Columbia have enacted autonomous vehicle legislation. In 2019 alone, 25 new bills were enacted in 25 states, and a further 56 remain pending.148 Increasingly, there are concerns that states may be racing to cement their positions as leaders in AV testing in the absence of a federal regulatory framework by introducing increasingly permissive bills that allow testing without human safety drivers.149</p><p>Some states are explicitly tying bills to federal guidelines in anticipation of congressional action. On April 2, 2019, D.C. lawmakers proposed the Autonomous Vehicles Testing Program Amendment Act of 2019, which would set up a review and permitting process for autonomous vehicle testing within the District Department of Transportation. Companies seeking to test self-driving cars in the city would have to provide an array of information to officials, including for each vehicle it plans to testsafety operators in the test vehicles, testing locations, insurance, and safety strategies.150 Crucially, it would require testing companies to certify that their vehicles comply with federal safety policies; share with officials data on trips and any crash or cybersecurity incidents; and train operators on safety.151</p><p>On April 12, 2019, the California DMV published proposed autonomous vehicle regulations that allow the testing and deployment of autonomous motor trucks (delivery vehicles) weighing less than 10,001 pounds on California's public roads.152 The DMV held a public hearing on May 30, 2019, at its headquarters in Sacramento to gather input and discuss the regulations. The DMV's regulations continue to exclude the autonomous testing or deployment of vehicles weighing more than 10,001 pounds. In the California legislature, two new bills related to autonomous vehicles were introduced: S.B. 59153 would establish a working group on autonomous passenger vehicle policy development while S.B. 336154 would require transit operators to ensure certain automated transit vehicles are staffed by employees.</p><p>On June 13, 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law C.S./H.B. 311, which establishes a statewide statutory framework, permits fully automated vehicles to operate on public roads, and removes obstacles that hinder the development of self-driving cars.155 In Oklahoma, Governor Kevin Stitt signed legislation (S.B. 365) restricting city and county governments from legislating autonomous vehicles, ensuring that such legislation would be entirely in the hands of state and federal lawmakers.156 Pennsylvania, which last year passed legislation creating a commission on \"highly automated vehicles,\" has proposed a bill that would authorize the use of an autonomous shuttle vehicle on a route approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (H.B. 1078).157</p><p>Given the fast pace of developments and tangle of applicable rules, it is essential that companies operating in this space stay abreast of legal developments in states as well as cities in which they are developing or testing autonomous vehicles, while understanding that any new federal regulations may ultimately preempt states' authorities to determine, for example, safety policies or how they handle their passengers' data.</p><p>E. Data Privacy</p><p>While not strictly focused on artificial intelligence technologies, a number of state and federal developments in the area of data privacy are noteworthy, given the central importance of access to large quantities of data (often including personal and private data) to the successful development and operation of many AI systems.158</p><p>1. Voter Privacy Act of 2019</p><p>In July 2019, California Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced the Voter Privacy Act of 2019, which is currently before the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.159 As introduced, the Act will give voters certain rights with regard to their personal data collected in connection with voter information. In particular, the Act provides notice rights, rights of access, deletion rights, and rights to prohibit transfer or targeting through use of the data. The stated purpose of the Act is to put an end to the manipulation and misdirection of voters through the use of their personal data, and the Act would be monitored by the Federal Election Commission. Obviously, for companies collecting voter information as part of the data processed by AI systems, the Act could add a number of significant compliance requirements should it ultimately pass.</p><p>2. California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\")</p><p>A series of amendments to the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") were signed into effect by the Governor in early October.160 Some of these amendments may prove significant to certain businesses; such as A.B. 25, which provides a one-year carve-out of the personal information of employees from personal information that would otherwise fall under the requirements of the CCPA. Similarly, A.B. 1355 creates a one-year carve-out of certain personal information that is collected as part of purely business-to-business communications, which may also help alleviate concerns about how to handle personal information necessarily acquired in a business context. In addition to the amendments, the California Attorney General's Office released a series of proposed regulations for implementing the requirements of the CCPA, and initiated a period in which they will solicit public comments before making any final changes putting the regulations into force and effect.161 The proposed regulations generally set out guidance for how businesses should implement the notice provisions of the CCPA, procedural steps for implementing consumer rights provisions and data collection requirements, as well as provide some clarification of the CCPA's non-discrimination provisions. The CCPA has been described as one of the most stringent state privacy laws and will affect AI technologies that are driven by personal data and companies who utilize or develop such technologies.</p><p>3. California \"Anti-Eavesdropping Act\"</p><p>On May 29, 2019 the California State Assembly passed a bill (A.B. 1395) requiring manufacturers of ambient listening devices like smart speakers to receive consent from users before retaining voice recordings, and banning manufacturers from sharing command recordings with third parties. The bill is currently pending in the State Senate.162</p><p>F. Intellectual Property</p><p>Intellectual property issues related to AI have also been at the forefront of the new technology, as record numbers of U.S. patent applications involve a form of machine learning component. In January 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") released revised guidance relating to subject matter eligibly for patents and on the application of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 on computer implemented inventions. On the heels of that guidance, on August 27, 2019, the USPTO published a request for public comment on several patent-related issues regarding AI inventions.163 The request for comment posed 12 questions covering several topics from \"patent examination policy to whether new forms of intellectual property protection are needed.\" The questions included topics such whether patent laws, which contemplate only human inventors, should be amended to allow entities other than a human being to be considered an inventor.164 The commenting period was extended until November 8, 2019, and many of the comments submitted argue that ownership of patent rights should remain reserved for only natural or juridical persons.165</p><p>On December 13, 2019, the World Intellectual Property Organization (\"WIPO\") published a draft issue paper on IP policy and AI, and requested comments on several areas of IP, including patents and data, and, similarly to the USPTO before it, with regard to issues of inventorship and ownership.166 The commenting period is set to end on February 14, 2020.</p><p>G. Law Enforcement</p><p>Increasingly, algorithms are also being used at every stage of criminal proceedings, from gathering evidence to making sentencing and parole recommendations. H.R. 4368, the \"Justice in Forensic Algorithms Act of 2019,\" was introduced in the House on September 17, 2019, would prohibit the use of trade secrets privileges to prevent defense access to the source code of proprietary algorithms used as evidence in criminal proceedings, and require that the Director of NIST establish a program to provide for the creation and maintenance of standards for the development and use of computational forensic software (\"Computational Forensic Algorithm Standards\") to protect due process rights.167 The standards would address underlying scientific principles and methods, an assessment of disparate impact on the basis of demographic features such as race or gender, requirements for testing and validating the software and for publicly available documentation, and requirements for reports that are provided to defendants by the prosecution documenting the use and results of computational forensic software in individual cases (e.g., source code).168</p><p>Police departments often use predictive algorithms for various functions, such as to help identify suspects. While such technologies can be useful, there is increasing awareness building with regard to the risk of biases and inaccuracies.169 Private groups, localities, states, and Congress have reacted to concerns fomented by AI applied to policing. In a paper released on February 13, 2019, researchers at the AI Now Institute, a research center that studies the social impact of artificial intelligence, found that police across the United States may be training crime-predicting AIs on falsified \"dirty\" data,170 calling into question the validity of predictive policing systems and other criminal risk-assessment tools that use training sets consisting of historical data.171 In some cases, police departments had a culture of purposely manipulating or falsifying data under intense political pressure to bring down official crime rates. In New York, for example, in order to artificially deflate crime statistics, precinct commanders regularly asked victims at crime scenes not to file complaints. In predictive policing systems that rely on machine learning to forecast crime, those corrupted data points become legitimate predictors, creating \"a type of tech-washing where people who use these systems assume that they are somehow more neutral or objective, but in actual fact they have ingrained a form of unconstitutionality or illegality.\"172</p><p>A Utah law (H.B. 57) requiring that law enforcement obtain a warrant before accessing any person's electronic data went into effect in May 2019.173 The law reflects a legislative recognition of individual privacy rights, and we will continue to closely watch this space and the extent to which its approach may be replicated in other state legislatures. Other efforts have been more limited in scope and focused only on certain AI applications, like facial recognition.174 Beyond policy and advocacy, some groups have turned to the courts. The majority of these efforts sound in FOIA attempts to understand how police may be using predictive systems to aid their work.175</p><p>H. Health Care</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the use of AI in healthcare draws some of the most exciting prospects and deepest trepidation, given potential risks.176 As of yet, there are few regulations directed at AI in healthcare specifically, but regulators have recently acknowledged that existing frameworks for medical device approval are not well-suited to AI-related technologies. The US Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has proposed a specific review framework for AI-related medical devices, intended to encourage a pathway for innovative and life-changing AI technologies, while maintaining the FDA's patient safety standards.</p><p>In April 2019, the FDA recently published a discussion paper - 'Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)'offering that new framework for regulating health products using AI/machine learning (\"AI/ML\") software as a medical device (\"SaMD\"), and seeking comment.177 The paper introduces that one of the primary benefits of using AI in an SaMD product is the ability of the product to continuously update in light of an infinite feed of real-world data. But the current review system for medical devices requires a pre-market review, and pre-market review of any modifications, depending on the significance of the modification.178 If AI-based SaMDs are intended to constantly adjust, the FDA posits that many of these modifications will require pre-market review - a potentially unsustainable framework in its current form. The paper instead proposes an initial pre-market review for AI-related SaMDs that anticipates the expected changes, describes the methodology, and requires manufacturers to provide certain transparency and monitoring, as well as updates to the FDA about the changes that in fact resulted in accordance with the information provided in the initial review. Additional discussion and guidance is expected following the FDA's review of the comments.</p><p>I. Financial Services</p><p>As the adoption of AI technology in the U.S. continues across a wide range of industries and the public sector, legislators are increasingly making efforts to regulate applicable data standards at federal level. On May 9, 2019, Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) announced that the House Committee on Financial Services would launch two task forces focused on financial technology (\"fintech\") and AI:179 a task force on financial intelligence that will focus on the topics of regulating the fintech sector, and an AI task force that will focus on machine learning in financial services and regulation, emerging risks in algorithms and big data, combatting fraud and digital identification technologies, and the impact of automation on jobs in financial services.180</p><p>On September 24, 2019, H.R. 4476, the Financial Transparency Act of 2019, was reintroduced into Congress.181 The bipartisan bill, which calls for the Treasury secretary to create uniform, machine-readable data standards for information reported to financial regulatory agencies,182 has been referred to the Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit. By seeking to make information that is reported to financial regulatory agencies electronically searchable, the bill's supporters aim to \"further enable the development of RegTech and Artificial Intelligence applications,\" \"put the United States on a path towards building a comprehensive Standard Business Reporting program,\" and \"harmonize and reduce the private sector's regulatory compliance burden, while enhancing transparency and accountability.\"183</p><p>J. Labor and Hiring</p><p>Amid the acceleration in the spread of AI and automated decision-making in the public and private sector, many U.S. and multinational companies have begun to use AI to streamline and introduce objectivity into their employment process.184 While AI presents an opportunity to eliminate bias from the hiring process, it has also been seen to introduce bias because of inadequate data underlying and powering its algorithms. Legislators are taking action to recognize the potentially vast implications of AI technology on employment and employees' rights. As a result, 2019 saw tentative legislation at federal and state level take on an increased focus upon AI in employment and hiring.</p><p>1. AI JOBS Act of 2019</p><p>On 28 January 2019, the proposed AI JOBS Act of 2019 was introduced and, if enacted, would authorize the Department of Labor to work with businesses and education institutions in creating a report that analyses the future of AI and its impact on the American labor landscape.185 Similar to H.R. 153, this bill indicates federal recognition of the threat the introduction of AI technology poses; however, there is no indication as to what actions the federal government might take in order to offer labor protection, and the bill has not progressed to date.</p><p>2. Workers' Right to Training Act (S. 2468)</p><p>On September 11, 2019, Sen. Brown (D-OH) introduced S. 2468, the \"Workers' Right to Training Act,\" which would require employers to provide notice and training to employees whose jobs are in danger of being changed or replaced due to technology, and for other purposes.186 \"Technology\" is defined in the bill as including \"automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, personal computing, information technology, and e-commerce.\"187</p><p>3. Illinois AI Video Interview Act</p><p>Employers have begun using AI-powered interview platformsequipped with abilities such as sentiment analysis, facial recognition, video analytics, neural language processing, machine learning and speech recognitionthat are capable of screening candidates against various parameters to assess competencies, experience and personality on the basis of hundreds of thousands of data points, and rank them against other candidates based on an \"employability\" score.188 However, the lack of transparency resulting from the use of proprietary algorithms to hire and reject candidates has led to some regulatory pushback.</p><p>In May 2019, the Illinois legislature unanimously passed H.B. 2557 (the \"Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act\"), which governs the use of AI by employers when hiring candidates.189 State Rep. Jaime Andrade Jr. (D), who co-sponsored the bill, noted that spoken accents or cultural differences could end up improperly warping the results of a video interview, and that people who declined to sit for the assessment could be unfairly punished by not being considered for the job.190 On August 9, 2019, Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Act into law, effective January 1, 2020. Under the Act, an employer using videotaped interviews when filling a position in Illinois may use AI to analyze the interview footage only if the employer:</p><p> Gives notice to the applicant that the videotaped interview may be analyzed using AI for purposes of evaluating the applicant's fitness for the position. (A Senate floor amendment removed from the bill a requirement for written notice.)Provides the applicant with an explanation of how the AI works and what characteristics it uses to evaluate applicants.Obtains consent from the applicant to use AI for an analysis of the video interview.Keeps video recordings confidential by sharing the videos only with persons whose expertise or technology is needed to evaluate the applicant, and destroying both the video and all copies within 30 days after an applicant requests such destruction.</p><p>Illinois employers using such software will need to carefully consider how they are addressing the risk of AI-driven bias in their current operations, and whether hiring practices fall under the scope of the new law, which does not define \"artificial intelligence,\" what level of \"explanation\" is required, or whether it applies to employers seeking to fill a position in Illinois regardless of where the interview takes place. While the Illinois Act currently remains the only such law to date in the U.S., companies using automated technology in recruitment should expect that the increasing use of AI technology in recruitment is likely to lead to further regulatory proposals in due course.191</p><p>Footnotes</p><p> 1. Most AI is specific to particular domains and problems. A \"general\" AI can be thought of as one that can be applied to a wide variety of cross-domain activities and perform at the level of, or better than a human agent, or has the capacity to self-improve its general cognitive abilities similar to or beyond human capabilities.</p><p> 2.

Note that, in companion bills SB-5527 and HB-1655, introduced on January 23, 2019, Washington State lawmakers drafted a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at governing the use of automated decision systems by state agencies, including the use of automated decision-making in the triggering of automated weapon systems. In addition to addressing the fact that eliminating algorithmic-based bias requires consideration of fairness, accountability, and transparency, the bills also include a private right of action. According to the bills' sponsors, automated decision systems are rapidly being adopted to make or assist in core decisions in a variety of government and business functions, including criminal justice, health care, education, employment, public benefits, insurance, and commerce, and are often unregulated and deployed without public knowledge. Under the new law, in using an automated decision system, an agency would be prohibited from discriminating against an individual, or treating an individual less favorably than another on the basis of one or more of a list of factors such as race, national origin, sex, or age. The bills were reintroduced in the 2020 session and remain in Committee. SB 5527, Reg. Sess. 2019-2020 (Wash. 2020); HB-1655, Reg. Sess. 2010-2020 (Wash. 2020).</p><p> 38.

Another potentially significant effort is the work currently being performed under the direction of DARPA on developing explainable AI systems. See <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence\">https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence</url>. Because it can be difficult to understand exactly how a machine learning algorithm arrives at a particular conclusion or decision, some have referred to artificial intelligence as being a 'black box' that is opaque in its reasoning. However, a black box is not always an acceptable operating paradigm, particularly in the context of battlefield decisions, within which it will be important for human operators of AI-driven systems to understand why particular decisions are being made to ensure trust and appropriate oversight of critical decisions. As a result, DARPA has been encouraging the development of new technologies to explain and improve machine-human understanding and interaction.

Thus far, the comments submitted generally support GM's petition for temporary exemption and the removal of regulatory barriers to the compliance certification of ADS-DVs. Some commentators have raised concerns that there is insufficient information in the petition to establish safety equivalence between traditionally operated vehicles and ADS-DVs, and regarding the ability of ADS-DVs to safely operate in unexpected and emergency situations. However, it is likely that NHTSA will grant petitions for temporary exemption to facilitate the development of ADS technology, contingent on extensive data-sharing requirements and a narrow geographic scope of operation. In addition, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also issued a request for comments on proposed rule-making for Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations that may need to be reconsidered for Automated Driving System- Dedicated Vehicles (ADS-DVs).

For example, AI has been used in robot-assisted surgery in select fields for years, and studies have shown that AI-assisted procedures can result in far fewer complications. Brian Kalis, Matt Collier and Richard Fu, '10 Promising AI Applications in Health Care', Harvard Business Review (10 May 2018), available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/05/10-promising-ai-applications-in-health-care\">https://hbr.org/2018/05/10-promising-ai-applications-in-health-care</url>. Yet, The New York Times published an article in March 2019 warning of healthcare AI's potential failures, including small changes in vernacular leading to vastly disparate results (eg, 'alcohol abuse' leading to a different diagnosis than 'alcohol dependence'); see Cade Metz and Craig S Smith, 'Warning of a Dark Side to A.I. in Health Care', The New York Times (21 March 2019), available at nytimes.com/2019/03/21/science/health-medicine-artificial-intelligence.html. And these issues are backed by studies, including one released by Science - one of the highest acclaimed journals - just prior to the article, which discusses how 'vulnerabilities allow a small, carefully designed change in how inputs are presented to a system to completely alter its outputs, causing it to confidently arrive at manifestly wrong conclusions.'

(As you may remember from that previous article, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) limits made-in-the-USA claims to products that meet the all or virtually all standard, where all significant parts and processing [are] of U.S. origin. That is, the product should contain no - or negligible - foreign content.)</p><p>You, studious reader, also know that NAD attempts to harmonize its decisions with the guidelines set by regulators. So, how did J-B Weld fare?</p><p>The Takeaway</p><p>Not so well. The NAD held that reasonable consumers would consider the caps, tubes, syringes and other delivery system components as part of the product itself rather than packaging, which wouldn't be subject to the all-or-virtually-all requirement. It recommended that J-B Weld discontinue the claims. J-B Weld, in turn, rejected the recommendations and announced its plans to appeal to the National Advertising Review Board (NARB).</p><p>And now, seven months later, NARB has weighed in, agreeing fully with NAD's original decision and recommendations.</p><p>But man, it's hard to keep J-B Weld down. The company rejected NARB's recommendations, saying that it believes that its Made in the U.S.A. advertising is adequately substantiated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p><p>And so, the next step: the FTC. The NARB says it's referring the advertising to an appropriate government agency [in this case, the Federal Trade Commission] for possible enforcement action.</p><p>Was pushing back at every step of the way a wise choice, or a recipe for a complaint? Particularly to an FTC that has been hungering to impose more significant Made-in-USA sanctions?</p><p>AMD Settles Bulldozer Suit</p><p>Class can draw on $12 million settlement fund</p><p>Back to School</p><p>In another throwback to an earlier case, we revisit Tony Dickey, et al. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., a class action that made quite a splash when it was filed back in 2015.</p><p>Now, pay attention. This is nerd material. The original complaint centered on Advanced Micro Devices's (AMD's) Bulldozer core processors. Each core processor is an independent processing unit within a computer's CPU that can independently execute user commands; if your computer boasts more core processors, you can reasonably expect increased processing power and a faster execution of commands.</p><p>The suit alleges that the Bulldozer was hawked to high-end designers and gamers as the world's first 8-core CPU. But Dickey and the class he represented accused AMD of softening its definition of core. The original suit maintains that AMD built the Bulldozer processors by stripping away components from two cores and combining what was left to make a single 'module.' But by removing certain components of two cores to make one module, they no longer work independently.</p><p>Which meant that an 8-core was really a 4-core. Which meant decreased performance. And a false advertising suit.</p><p>The Takeaway</p><p>In our last report, we relayed how AMD suffered a defeat in the Northern District of California when the court certified Dickey's putative class of AMD processor buyers.</p><p>And now, a settlement has been reached.</p><p>The chipmaker has agreed to set up a $12.1 million fund for the chip purchasers with a cap of 30% of the fund value placed on attorney's fees. The award works out to $35 per chip if 20% of the class stakes a claim. The value of the proposed common fund represents a recovery of approximately 20% of the damages Plaintiffs would have sought to prove at trial on behalf of the certified class, the agreement reads. And, based on their experience, Class Counsel estimate that claiming class members are likely to receive more than 50% of the value of their certified claims had they prevailed at trial.</p><p>One wonders how the class members feel about this statement, when some of the original processors sold for upward of $250 each.</p><p>Oooooh! Ryan's in Trouble!</p><p>Someone told on 8-year-old YouTube king's channel</p><p>Not Toyin' Around</p><p>Remember Ryan, from Ryan ToysReview? When last we met Ryan, we were stunned by his reach as an influencer. At the tender age of 7, Ryan, along with his mother and father, was the owner and star of one of the world's most popular YouTube channels. At the time (2017 to be exact), his frenetic, hyper-cut, colorful review videos had earned him somewhere around 9.4 million subscribers and more than 16 billion - that's billion - total views.</p><p>What a difference two years makes. Today, Ryan and his fam have captured the eyes of more than 21 million subscribers, and their videos have been viewed 31 billion times, more than any other channel on YouTube. One source estimates that he earned $22 million between June 2017 and June 2018.</p><p>That Was Then</p><p>Back then, we reported that Ryan's channel was peripherally involved in a Children's Advertising Review Unit investigation. One of Ryan's partners, WhatNot Toys, was accused of soliciting information from consumers without complying with the applicable legal requirements for the youngsters who were likely to visit its site.</p><p>In today's edition, Ryan is the main player in a complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission by Truth in Advertising, Inc. ((TINA). The accusation? Ryan is breaking the law, TINA claims, by failing to disclose material connections with brands that are appearing in his videos.</p><p>TINA cites a video with the understated title of Ryan's Drive Thru Pretend Play with Hardee's New Star Pals Toys!!! TINA maintains that this video, launched days after a similarly food-themed video that lacked brand endorsement, is aimed squarely at preschoolers who are unable to assess the relationship between organic content and advertisement. While adults may be able to spot the ad, the watchdog explains in its case summary, [T]hey are not the target audience . . . children under the age of five are. And for them, it's impossible to discern the difference, even if the Hardee's video disclosed the burger joint's partnership with Ryan ToysReview, which it does not.</p><p>The complaint cites a passel of other videos for similar infractions involving well-known brands like Chuck-E-Cheese and Nickelodeon.</p><p>The Takeaway</p><p>TINA references another CARU investigation from 2017, in which the group found that sponsored content . . . was not adequately disclosed, on Ryan's channel. CARU concluded that children could reasonably believe that all the Ryan ToysReview videos, including sponsored ones, were independent and unbiased unless there was a clear disclosure indicating otherwise.</p><p>TINA notes that CARU recommended that Ryan's videos feature an audible disclosure at the beginning of each video to identify sponsored content, and that the channel ignored their guidance.</p><p>And then, interestingly, TINA takes CARU to task: [B]ut the recommendation itself was, unfortunately, flawed because it was not based on data regarding the channel's target audience's age or consumer perception. . . . Had CARU obtained data on the specific age of Ryan ToysReview's target audience, as well as the consumer perception of this demographic, it would undoubtedly have concluded that even an audible disclosure . . . does not clarify the content for its target audience or eradicate the deception present in such videos.</p><p>We'll see where this complaint goes; remember, it's essentially just a request for the FTC to take a look. But if you're advertising products and services to kids, it might pay to remember that children under 13 are not all the same when it comes to making subtle distinctions about content. TINA is adding a further shading to the under-13 demographic: youngsters under the age of 5 or so, who cannot differentiate advertising from regular content at all, and who therefore deserve extra consideration.</p><p>YouTube and Google Settle COPPA Claims With FTC</p><p>But it isn't the $170M settlement figure that's interesting</p><p>What's It Going to Look Like?</p><p>Let's start at the end, shall we?</p><p>What will YouTube look like after its recent settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)?</p><p>The agreement, which was shared with parent company Google and has made big, big news (see here,  here and here), is seen to be yet another sign that federal and state regulators are taking off the gloves when it comes to the big tech companies.</p><p>But, in the immediate future, what does it mean for YouTube's design?</p><p>The service, which was purchased by Google in the Dark Ages 2006, has always had a bit of an anarchic feel, which was preserved even after Google fitted it with its famed custom ad technology. To the present day, anyone can watch most of the platform's videos without being challenged about who they are or whether the content they're consuming is appropriate.</p><p>But that will have to change.</p><p>Demands</p><p>Here's why. The FTC said about the agreement that [t]he proposed settlement requires Google and YouTube to develop, implement, and maintain a system that permits channel owners to identify their child-directed content on the YouTube platform so that YouTube can ensure it is complying with COPPA.</p><p>As you know (but in case you don't), COPPA is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and it requires websites to obtain parental consent before gathering personal information - including browsing habits - from children under 13. That includes cookies, which are the lifeblood of Google's ad model.</p><p>The Commission brushed aside arguments that YouTube's 13-and-over registration requirement made any difference to whether a good deal of its content was actually viewed by children. (See this article for background.)</p><p>But there's more: The companies must notify channel owners that their child-directed content may be subject to the COPPA Rule's obligations and provide annual training about complying with COPPA for employees who deal with YouTube channel owners.</p><p>Channel owners, who are allowed to monetize their presence on the platform, will be drawn into the system as well.</p><p>The Takeaway</p><p>Oh - there's also the $170 million penalty. You can tell that even the normally stuffy FTC staff is excited about something when they break out the charts.</p><p>But, in the end, the money isn't the real story - as the New York Times article cited above notes, the entire penalty represents only 1.7% of parent company Alphabet's profit last quarter. It's nothing.</p><p>What is tantalizing is how on earth YouTube will be refitted so permission can be sought from parents before any personal information is collected about a child under the age of 13. This change will be a vast undertaking.</p><p>According to the FTC at least, both companies were aware of their influence on children and the size of their under-13 audience. The companies boasted YouTube: The new Saturday morning cartoons in one marketing presentation. The #1 website regularly visited by kids claimed another.</p><p>While sloganeering like this served as evidence for the Commission to demonstrate Google and YouTube's unlawful behavior, it also serves to point out the immensity of the problem facing the companies.</p><p>Thirty million people visit YouTube every day.</p><p>Which of them are kids?</p><p>IAB Tech Lab to Propose New Privacy Standard</p><p>It's an individualized digital opt-out token that may defuse changes wrought by the CCPA</p><p>Reminiscing</p><p>Remember Y2K? (Please say you do.) Remember the anxiety, the fear, the uncertainty?</p><p>Well, 20 years to the day the advertising world will be facing its own mini-version of the famed millennial panic. No, no one's worried that gas will stop pumping or the Eastern Seaboard will lose electricity.</p><p>But still: The technological structure of The Way Things Are will shift beneath us at midnight on Dec. 31, 2019. Because that's when the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 kicks in.</p><p>Ripple Effects</p><p>We're so fond of calling California the 800-pound gorilla of the national economy that we ought to come up with a different metaphor already. But even clich\u00e9s are sometimes true: Decisions made in California loom large for citizens of every other state. And the CCPA is unprecedented legislation in the United States. Once it is in place, California residents will be granted European-style rights regarding their personal information. That will affect everyone doing business in the Golden State - which means everyone. The overall effect of the law will be nothing short of a sea change.</p><p>For a comprehensive review, see our resources here, but the main thrust of the CCPA is that Californians will have the right to prohibit businesses from selling their personal information and the right to have it deleted. They can ask for detailed information about their personal data, including purposes for which it is being used and specific personal information held on file.</p><p>Because the CCPA demands a radical departure from the current ad infrastructure, businesses are becoming concerned - especially since the enforcement penalties are robust, carrying civil penalties of $2,500 per violation, or up to $7,500 per intentional violation.</p><p>The Takeaway</p><p>Luckily, the folks at the IAB Tech Lab, a partner to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, are taking charge with a new  proposed privacy architecture that will help address the requirements of the CCPA in a new, digital token format.</p><p>Unlike the mounds of cookies that exist on the devices of everyone who doesn't block them or regularly clean them out, the token will be a single identifier that will be used by online publishers and advertisers. This centralized point of control will allow the user to set data preferences in one fell swoop, and those preferences will cascade outward to the publishers, the ad companies and the data companies that undergird the system.</p><p>Although details are forthcoming - the technology will be shared at the World Wide Web Consortium's Improving Web Advertising Business Group - it sounds like a win-win. Consumers can simply walk away from tracking if they wish, while companies will have one simple-to-manage gateway to identify those who want to stay. This will allow companies to demonstrate compliance as well.</p><p>New Developments</p><p>Since the passage of the initial law, there have also been legislative amendments, which the Governor has until Oct. 13 to veto or sign. You can find more information on these amendments at our blog post  here, but in short, here are the areas covered by the changes:</p><p> Scope of Coverage Delayed (transactional communications and employee request rights delayed one year).Exceptions to Statutory Coverage (Fair Credit Reporting Act information and vehicle recall and warranty information).Exceptions to Scope of Personal Information (publicly available government records, aggregate consumer information and deidentified information clarified or expanded).Scope of Non-Discrimination (value to be based on value to business, not consumer, plus a limited exception for loyalty programs).Consumer Rights Notices and Requests (changes to how rights are to be noticed and exercised).</p><p>We'll keep you posted on how this solution develops.</p><p>Check Out Our Latest Blog Posts</p><p>IAB Unveils Solution for Interest-Based Advertising and CCPA Do Not Sell Right</p><p>On September 17, 2019, numerous stakeholders in the digital advertising industry - including publishers, advertisers/brands, AdTech companies and law firms (including numerous representatives from BakerHostetler) - convened at the Interactive Advertising Bureau's (IAB) headquarters in New York for its unveiling of an industry solution to address the CCPA. The solution and its requirements of adoption by website publishers and advertisers/brands alike are discussed in detail  here.</p><p>Lead Generation Leads to FTC Settlement</p><p>There is nothing particularly new about the idea of lead generation in marketing. Companies have from the very beginning paid their own employees or paid others to help find prospects for their goods and services. However, in today's digital world and with the myriad different ways in which consumer information is gathered, the use of third parties for lead generation has proliferated. Not surprisingly, so has the abuse of lead generation efforts. Read more  here.</p><p>CCPA Exceptions: What Qualifies as Activity 'Wholly Outside' of California?</p><p>Much has been said about the scope of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the far-reaching implications the law will have on businesses throughout the United States. Although it is true that the territorial reach of the law is broad, it is not without limits. The CCPA explicitly includes a geographic exception that may be important in determining the applicability of the law to personal information processed by businesses that do not have a physical presence (including employees) in California.

As we have previously shared, the FTC is in the midst of a series of hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, including sessions on  Big Data, Privacy, and Competition and the  Antitrust Framework for Evaluating Acquisitions of Potential or Nascent Competitors in Digital Marketplaces. Multiple European regulators (the  EU,  Germany and now Austria) recently launched investigations into Amazon. Technology platforms are a priority for many other enforcers as well, from China to Australia to the UK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With different competition authorities weighing in on how to assess tech competition, there is the potential for divergence in intensity of enforcement as well as whether existing competition doctrine suffices. Disparities are borne out by recent statements emanating from U.S., Australian, and UK competition agencies and officials.</p><p>Fresh remarks from the U.S. DOJ Antitrust Division indicate the agency does not support a regulatory approach to platforms and the digital economy. In a speech last week, agency head Makan Delrahim addressed Antitrust Enforcement in the Zero-Price Economy, noting that while zero-price strategies have \"exploded\" with the rise of digital platforms, \"the strategy of selling a product or service at zero price is not new, nor is it unique to the digital economy.\" Mr. Delrahim acknowledged the divergent views of how antitrust enforcement should treat such products and services, which range from exemption from antitrust scrutiny entirely to the creation of new, specially crafted rules and standards. Rejecting both of these \"extreme views\" as \"misplaced,\" he emphasized the ability of current antitrust doctrine - including the consumer welfare standard - to tackle the issue, stating: \"[W]e do not need a wholesale revision of the antitrust laws to address competitive concerns in these contexts. . . . [O]ur antitrust laws and principles are flexible enough to adapt to the challenges of the digital economy.\" Mr. Delrahim called for \"careful case-by-case analysis\" in enforcement. He touted the innovation and benefits that zero-price strategies have brought to consumers, crediting the country's \"pro-market economic and legal structures\" and cautioning against \"distortions of our antitrust standards\" to address issues like privacy and data protection if they do not impede the functioning of the free market.</p><p>His speech echoes a view Mr. Delrahim and others at the Antitrust Division have expressed previously regarding the need (or lack thereof) for new rules to address the antitrust implications of \"big data.\" In an October 2018 speech regarding startups, innovation, and antitrust policy, Mr. Delrahim remarked that \"accumulation of data drives innovation and benefits consumers\" in many ways (including by enabling zero-price offerings), and that forced sharing risks undermining innovation by reducing incentives for both incumbents and new entrants. Invoking Trinko,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>Verizon Communic'ns, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 407-08 (2004).</p></bodyText></footnote> he stated that \"free and competitive markets\" - not antitrust agencies or courts - are best equipped to determine \"how much data should be shared, with whom, and at what price.\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bernard Nigro, Jr. has taken a similar position, stating that \"forced sharing of critical assets reduces the incentive to invest in innovation\" and that \"where benefits to sharing exist, they can be best captured by the parties negotiating in a free and competitive market, not by government regulation.\"</p><p>By contrast, other jurisdictions and industry observers considering the competitive implications of digital platforms have questioned the status quo. In their view, control of valuable data provides a competitive advantage and raises entry barriers that may entrench a platform's dominant position and lead to competitive or consumer harm. At a higher level, France and Germany just announced an effort to overhaul competition rules to enable European companies to better develop technologies that compete on the global stage.</p><p>For example, last week the Australian Productivity Commission and the New Zealand Productivity Commission released a joint report that reviews how most effectively to address the challenges and harness the opportunities the digital economy creates (particularly for small- to medium-sized enterprises). In a section titled \"Existing competition regulation may not be adequate for digital markets,\" the report addressed the challenges of applying existing laws to the digital economy, including (among others) that zero-price goods and services complicate the analysis of market definition and market power, and that data \"is an increasingly important business input and may be a source of market power\" but is not adequately captured in traditional competition policy. Although the report acknowledged that in some cases technological developments might obviate the need for regulation (and in others the mere threat of regulation may be enough), it posited that new regulation might be necessary to maintain competitive markets: \"[I]f 'winner-take-most' markets do end up prevailing, competition regulators may need to consider extending tools such as essential service access regimes to digital services.\" An essential service (or \"essential facilities\") regime would treat a digital platform's data as an input essential to competition and require the platform to provide its competitors with reasonable access to it. In contrast to the Productivity Commissions' suggestion, U.S.competition enforcers to date have been loath to treat digital platforms as essential facilities.</p><p>The Productivity Commissions' report comes on the heels of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Digital Platforms Inquiry preliminary findings released in December. The ACCC expressed similar concerns about the rise of digital platforms and the threat they pose to consumers and the competitive process. Addressing what it found to be Google's and Facebook's market power in a number of markets,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>The preliminary report finds that Google has market power in online search, online search advertising and news media referral services, and that Facebook has market power in social media services, display advertising and news media referral services.</p></bodyText></footnote> the report encouraged governments to be \"responsive, and indeed proactive, in reacting to and anticipating challenges and problems\" posed by digital platforms. It offered eleven preliminary recommendations to address these concerns, including: amending merger law to expressly consider potential competition and the data at issue in the transaction, requiring advance notice of any acquisition by a large digital platform of a business with activities in Australia, and tasking a regulatory authority with monitoring the conduct of vertically integrated digital platforms. The report also proposed areas for further analysis, such as: a digital platforms ombudsman, the monitoring of intermediary pricing and opt-in targeted advertising. As such, indications from Australia suggest calls for more competition intervention have some teeth.</p><p>The UK may have a similar appetite, as indicated by a new Parliament publication addressing \"Disinformation and 'fake news.'\" The statement calls for increased oversight and greater transparency into \"how the big tech companies work and what happens to our data,\" highlighting Facebook's treatment and monetization of user data as an example of why intervention is needed. In addition to recommending a compulsory Code of Ethics overseen by an independent regulator with \"statutory powers to monitor relevant tech companies,\" the publication advocated for greater competition law scrutiny of and enforcement against digital platforms, including an investigation of Facebook and a \"comprehensive audit\" of the social media advertising market. Invoking existing \"legislative tools\" such as privacy laws, data protection legislation, and antitrust and competition law, the report cautioned: \"The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight.\"</p><p>Operating under an international patchwork of competition approaches can present a challenge to global enterprises.

This newsletter will provide periodic updates on both, offering an analytical look at how the antitrust agencies are approaching important competition issues and what current investigations may mean for potential future enforcement. We hope our experienceboth inside and outside these agencieswill provide insights that help you make more informed decisions for your business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LETTER FROM THE EDITORS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Large Technology Companies Are Under Increased Scrutiny</p><p>Large digital platforms are under increased scrutiny from legislators, presidential candidates, and the antitrust agencies. For example, the House Judiciary Committee has launched a \"top-to-bottom\" review of digital competition. Senator Amy Klobuchar has introduced legislation to modify merger review standards, and Senator Elizabeth Warren has released a plan to \"break up big tech\" and set new rules for the behavior of digital platforms. Other candidates for the Democratic nomination have voiced support for similar proposals.</p><p>Leaders from both agencies have expressed the view that existing antitrust standards are flexible enough to address potentially anticompetitive conduct by platform companies. Nonetheless, agency leaders have promised greater scrutiny and committed additional investigative resources to the technology sector, particularly with regard to digital platform competition. Both agencies have held hearings or public workshops on digital competition issues. The FTC has launched a Technology Task Force to investigate conduct and acquisitions in technology markets. And the DOJ just announced a review of the business practices of market-leading online platforms.</p><p>This increased interest and the allocation of additional resources to technology competition issues may already be leading to more investigations, and if the antitrust agencies are concerned about competition in particular markets, they may be more inclined to dig deeper and investigate longer in these market segments. Of course, additional scrutiny does not necessarily mean that new enforcement actions will materialize, but it is worth watching carefully to see whether any new challenges develop under the current framework, and whether that framework itself is adjusted either by lawmakers here or around the world.</p><p> Read the FTC Press Release announcing the Technology Task ForceRead the DOJ Press Release announcing its review of online platform practices</p><p>DOJ Changes Policy on Compliance Programs in Criminal Enforcement</p><p>AAG Makan Delrahim has announced a new approach in criminal investigations to incentivize \"effective\" corporate antitrust compliance programs. In practice, this involves the DOJ (1) crediting compliance programs at the charging stage, (2) clarifying how the Antitrust Division evaluates compliance programs at the sentencing stage, and (3) publishing a guidance document to explain how prosecutors will evaluate compliance programs at both of those stages. The new policy allows companies with antitrust compliance programs deemed \"effective\" under the guidance document that have not obtained leniency under the Antitrust Division's existing Corporate Leniency Policy to be eligible for deferred prosecution agreements.</p><p>It is not yet clear how much impact this change will have on enforcement. The current model already provides substantial incentives for cooperation. Moreover, because a key consideration of the \"effectiveness\" of a compliance program is early detection and prompt self-reporting, beneficiaries of this new policy are likely corporations that may already have been early cooperators. This new approach does, however, raise the possibility of deferred prosecution for companies that discover a violation and promptly self-report, but are not the \"first in the door\" as would be necessary to qualify for leniency.</p><p> Read the DOJ Guidance on Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs in Criminal Antitrust InvestigationsRead AAG Delrahim's full speechRead the DOJ Press ReleaseRead Arnold &amp; Porter's  client Advisory for more detail</p><p>ADDITIONAL AGENCY UPDATES</p><p>Cases and Proceedings</p><p>Qualcomm Litigation</p><p> District Court orders permanent injunction and enters judgment in favor of FTC. On May 21, 2019, the Northern District of California ruled that Qualcomm's modem chip licensing practices violated the antitrust laws and ordered a permanent injunction.

Commissioner Rohit Chopra issued a statement praising the Qualcomm decision as a \"huge victory for every consumer who uses a smartphone,\" and Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter described the district court opinion as \"a thorough accounting of the calculated and pervasive illegal actions [by] Qualcomm.\" Similarly, Bureau Director Bruce Hoffman called the decision \"an important win for competition.\" In contrast, Commissioner Christine Wilson published an op-ed on May 29, 2019 expressing disagreement with the FTC legal theory and encouraging \"higher courts to reconsider the wisdom of the judge's conclusions.\" Read Statement of Commissioner ChopraRead Statement by Bureau Director HoffmanRead Op-ed by Commissioner WilsonSee Commissioner Slaughter's Statement to GCR DOJ files second Statement of Interest in Qualcomm litigation supporting stay pending appeal. After the Qualcomm district court denied Qualcomm's request for a stay of the injunctive relief pending appeal, Qualcomm sought a stay from the Ninth Circuit. The DOJ filed a statement of interest in the Ninth Circuit to support Qualcomm's motion. The Department argued that Qualcomm has a strong likelihood of success on the liability and remedy questions.

Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Rohit Chopra agreed to support the consent agreement without remedies in Colorado because the Colorado AG imposed conditions separately.

The DOJ filed an amicus brief in Mountain Crest v Anheuser-Busch, No. 3:16-cv-00595 (7th Cir.) on May 8, 2019. The district court previously ruled that an alleged conspiracy by beer producers to exclude competition in Ontario was protected by the Act of State doctrine because it involved an agreement with the Ontario government. The DOJ argued that the district court's ruling was correct insofar as it protected agreements between private parties and a government board but was improper insofar as it extended protection from antitrust scrutiny for separate agreements solely among the private parties. Read the DOJ Amicus Brief DOJ argues as Amicus before Federal Circuit regarding the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. The FTC and DOJ jointly filed a 2018 amicus brief in Intellectual Ventures v Capital One Financial, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Michael Murray participated in oral argument on June 3, 2019, arguing in both instances that Noerr-Pennington does not protect anticompetitive patent acquisitions.

On June 26, 2019, the DOJ filed a Statement of Interest arguing for a narrow interpretation of the Standards Development Organization Advancement Act of 2004, which provides an exemption from per se antitrust scrutiny (and from treble damages liability) for \"standards development activity\" by standard setting organizations. The DOJ argued that the court should interpret the SDOAA exemption as an affirmative defense and require a clear showing that the party qualifies as a standard-setting organization. Read the DOJ Statement of Interest DOJ seeks to offer views on McCarran-Ferguson doctrine. The DOJ requested to participate in an upcoming hearing on a motion to dismiss in a private antitrust litigation. The DOJ argued that defendant insurance companies \"advanced an overly broad reading of the McCarran-Ferguson antitrust exemption that is contrary to Supreme Court precedent and that would deny Florida consumers of health insurance the protections of federal antitrust law.\" See our  May 2019 Agency Insights newsletter for more on DOJ's Statement of Interest on the McCarran-Ferguson Act in this caseRead the DOJ's Statement of InterestRead the DOJ's Motion to Participate at ECF No. 97, Oscar Ins. Co. v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, No. 6:18-cv-1944 (M.D. Fl. July 8, 2019). DOJ files Statement of Interest advising against lost tax revenue as a basis for standing. In Oakland v. Oakland Raiders, the DOJ argued that lost tax revenue does not provide standing for the City of Oakland because (1) the interest in collecting taxes is beyond the scope of \"protected interests\" contemplated by the language of the Clayton Act and (2) tax losses are \"entirely derivative of the harm to market participants\" and finding standing in these circumstances would deter potentially procompetitive behavior.

In a complaint filed on June 10, 2019, the DOJ alleged that Canon and Toshiba circumvented the HSR waiting period for the sale of Toshiba subsidiary TMSC. DOJ argued that Canon obtained beneficial ownership of TMSC when voting rights were transferred to a merger vehicle for a \"nominal\" feebefore Canon exercised a $6.1 billion option for TMSC voting shares. DOJ alleged that the first transaction was designed to avoid an HSR filing and thus violated the HSR waiting period and reporting rules. The parties agreed to settle the claims for $2.5 million each. On June 27, 2019 the European Commission imposed a 28 million fine on Canon related to the same alleged conduct.

On May 6, 2019, the FTC staff submitted its third comment to the FDA on proposed industry guidance related to naming biological products. The FDA proposal would add a distinguishable suffix to the nonproprietary name of biosimilar and interchangeable products approved after January 2017. The FTC comment states that \"disparate treatment and the differentiated naming of biosimilar products would reduce biosimilar competition in the United States,\" because it would create two classes of biological products and limit or weaken new entry by creating potential misperception of quality differences and substitutability.

Congress requested that the FTC provide a report \"on the use of the FTC's standalone authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to address high pharmaceutical prices.\" In its report the Commission expressed the view that any attempt to utilize its Section 5 authority \"untethered from accepted theories of antitrust liability . . . is unlikely to find success in the courts.\" Commissioners Chopra and Slaughters published a separate statement that criticized the report for \"not fully outlin[ing] the contours of Section 5 of the FTC Act as they relate to pricing practices under these specific circumstances\" and advocating that the FTC \"carefully examine and aggressively employ new ways to utilize our enforcement tools.\" Read the Commission ReportRead Commissioners Chopra and Slaughter's Statement Antitrust agencies update merger filing form. On June 27, 2019, the FTC and DOJ announced procedural changes to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report Form.

Before the OECD on June 6, 2019, Assistant Attorney General Delrahim advocated once again for his \"New Madison Approach\" to issues at the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property. Delrahim emphasized the DOJ's focus on concerted action among licensee-implementors in the standard-setting context and reiterated DOJ's perspective that \"violating a FRAND commitment, by itself, should not give rise to an antitrust claim.\" Read AAG Delrahim's full speechSee our  October 2018 Agency Insights newsletter for more on DOJ's approach to IP and AntitrustRead our  client Advisory about DOJ's possible rift with the FTC and PTO DOJ says imposing fines in civil cases may be a useful tool. On May 7, 2019, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Andrew Finch suggested that the imposition of fines in monopolization cases might be appropriate in situations where the remedy is imposed many years after the conduct has occurred. Finch argued that in such cases divestiture would be \"risky\" and thus a fine might be required to provide sufficient relief and deterrence. Read Summary of Principal DAAG Finch's Comments DOJ discusses investigation of technology startup acquisitions. Before the OECD on June 3, 2019, Principal DAAG Andrew Finch argued that it can be difficult to assess competition issues where large technology platforms acquire small start-ups because start-ups may not create or retain documents clearly describing future competitive strategies. On June 11, 2019, Acting DAAG for Economics Jeffrey Wilder noted that DOJ would consider analyzing acquisitions of start-ups by large platforms under the rubric of attempted monopoly maintenance, in addition to conducting a merger analysis.

The agencies, which share civil antitrust enforcement authority, are reportedly engaged in a turf war over investigations of companies operating in the social media, online retail, search engine and app store space. In September, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons reportedly sent a letter to Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim expressing concern about the agencies' interactions. Meanwhile, they both appear to be investigating the same Big Tech companies, contrary to a clearance agreement penned by the agencies in 2002 and, reportedly, a more recent agreement concerning Big Tech. What is causing this largely uncharacteristic dispute and what effect will it have on enforcement?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Agency Clearance Process</p><p>As we discussed in June 2018, because the FTC and DOJ have concurrent civil antitrust jurisdiction, they rely on a clearance agreement to coordinate their authority. The current agreement's Appendix A seeks to prevent disputes by assigning particular industries to each agency. The quasi-independent, consumer-protection-focused FTC generally monitors industries that, as Simons recently put it, most directly affect consumers and their wallets. By contrast, the DOJ, an executive branch law enforcement agency, generally oversees less consumer-facing industries and sectors impacting national defense.</p><p>Because Appendix A is perfunctory, however, disputes frequently arise where a company targeted for investigation falls between Appendix A's cracks or, more commonly, straddles more than one industry.</p><p>The clearance agreement lists criteria for resolving these disputes. Emphasizing specialization and conservation of resources, it grants priority to the agency with expertise in the product or similar product ... gained through a substantial antitrust investigation ... within the last seven years. The agreement also enumerates a list of tie-breaking factors; for example, an agency gets more expertise credit if a case was litigated to verdict than if it was filed and later settled. While the vast majority of disputes are settled with Appendix A and the tie-breaking criteria, disagreements may also be settled through a neutral evaluator and, ultimately, upon elevation to the FTC chairperson and the assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division of the DOJ.</p><p>Conflicts Over Investigations Into Big Tech</p><p>The agencies' turf war over Big Tech suggests they may be struggling to apply the aging clearance agreement to companies and business models that were somewhat embryonic when it was drafted in 2002. For example, social media is not explicitly addressed in the agreement, and there appears to be no obvious analogue to it in Appendix A. Although there are reports that the FTC and DOJ struck a new clearance deal concerning Big Tech, there are bound to be hiccups. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, said last month: What's evident from this latest institutional tug of war is that the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the FTC are now actively battling each other to take the lead in pursuing Big Tech.</p><p>However, the emergence of Big Tech does not fully explain the discord. This summer, the DOJ and FTC publicly clashed in the FTC's monopolization case against cellular chipmaker Qualcomma quarter-century old enterprise whose product seems to fit neatly within Appendix A's framework. The case was filed by a divided FTC commission in the waning days of the Obama administration, alleging the company licensed standard essential patents in an anticompetitive fashion. The district court ruled in the FTC's favor, but, on Qualcomm's appeal, the DOJ filed an amicus brief siding with Qualcomm's request for a stay of the lower court's ruling. It argued: Immediate implementation of the remedy could put our nation's security at risk, which is vital to military readiness and other critical national interests.</p><p>More importantly, because the standard for a stay requires a peek at the merits of Qualcomm's appeal, the DOJ found itself in the unusual position of undermining the FTC's case: Qualcomm is likely to succeed on the merits because the district court's decision ignores established antitrust principles and imposes an overly broad remedy. The FTC responded in its opposition brief that the DOJ mischaracterized the district court's analysis, that it offered unsubstantiated concerns about R&amp;D, and that it essentially asserted that Qualcomm should be immune from antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Given the current political emphasis on a variety of real or perceived controversial competition issues, it is no wonder the FTC and DOJ have prioritized investigatory action over fidelity to the clearance process. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar, ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, said in a September hearing, I'd rather have a split investigation between the DOJ and FTC than no investigation. The clearance agreement itself says: Each agency nevertheless retains full responsibility and authority for the discharge of its statutory duties.</p><p>Finally, as former FTC chairman and architect of the clearance agreement Timothy Muris has pointed out, parochial interests also necessarily play a role in the clearance process. During the ABA's 2004 Antitrust spring meeting, Muris remarked: I have talked to you about the clearance issue, and 90% of you were opposed to the resolution that the DOJ and I reached. The reason is you thought your agency, whatever agency you were from, got the worst of the deal. There are three classes of cases: there are the ones that clearly go to the FTC; there are the ones that clearly go to the DOJ; and there are the ones that are in dispute. If you think the ones in dispute belong to your agency, clearly it was a bad deal. That is the overwhelming view of the alumni that I have talked to from both agencies.</p><p>September's Senate Antitrust Oversight Hearing</p><p>As has been widely reported, Big Tech clearance disputes played a role in a Sept. 17 Senate oversight hearing held by the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, which was attended by Simons and Delrahim. In opening remarks, Sen. Mike Lee chastised the agencies: In the past, the agencies have avoided too much mischief because they've generally played well together. Recently, this appears quite regrettably to have changed. From what I can tell, clearance disputes have become more frequent, more pronounced and more prolonged.</p><p>Lee asked Delrahim and Simons whether the FTC and DOJ were still operating under the clearance system to avoid duplicative efforts or have things broken down on this front? Simons responded, for the vast majority of matters, we continue to operate under the existing clearance agreement, but, upon further questioning, agreed with Lee that things have broken down at least in part. Delrahim added: I cannot deny that there are instances where Chairman Simons' and my time is wasted on those types of squabbles.</p><p>Lee also quizzed the agency heads whether, hypothetically, if they were asked to provide advice on setting up an antitrust regime in another country ... that didn't already have one, would you under any circumstances recommend that they follow the U.S. model and that they have two separate agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement? Simons responded flatly: No, I wouldn't. Delrahim remarked, it would be hard to imagine a system being designed at the first instance like we have today. He conceded: It's not the best model of efficiency.</p><p>The Hazards of Clearance Disputes</p><p>Disputes over clearance can have tangible adverse effects on enforcement. First, some have commented that delays caused by clearance disputes can narrow the efficacy of remedial options, particularly with mergers. As Sen. Richard Blumenthal has commented, The Big Tech companies are not waiting for the agencies to finish their cases. They are structuring their companies so that you can't unscramble the egg. Structural remedies are favored by Delrahim, who has commented that alternative, behavioral remedies should be used sparingly: The division has a strong preference for structural remedies over behavioral ones. ... The Antitrust Division is a law enforcer and, even where regulation is appropriate, it is not equipped to be the ongoing regulator.</p><p>Second, disputes over clearance and, more so, duplicative investigations waste agency resources, threaten to blunt their effectiveness and can lead to inconsistent and confusing governmental positions. In the Sept. 17 oversight hearing, Simons and Delrahim were both criticized for requesting an increase in funding: As you both acknowledged, both of you could use, and desperately need, more resources. That being the case, it makes no sense to me that we should have duplication of effort, when that has a tendency inevitably to undermine the effectiveness of what you're doing. Duplicative investigations dilute the specialization that is a principle goal of the agencies' clearance agreement and raise the risk that one agency will take legal positions that undercut the other. No doubt the DOJ's amicus brief in the Qualcomm case influenced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's decision to issue a stay pending appeal.</p><p>So how will the FTC and DOJ resolve their latest turf war? Perhaps they will revisit their clearance agreement and decide to split their authority by company or the business practice being investigated, based on prior agency experience, rather than by industry as Appendix A currently does. Or maybe Congress will decide to consolidate civil antitrust enforcement jurisdiction under one agency. That seems like a long shot considering the political implications. However, during the Senate's antitrust oversight hearing, Sen. Josh Hawley proposed cleaning up the overlap in jurisdiction by removing it from one agency and clearly designating enforcement authority to one agency. One thing is surethe agencies should not be duplicating civil antitrust investigations. Stay tuned.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Young</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INTRODUCTION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For years the technology sector has received significant antitrust scrutiny, but that scrutiny has increased markedly in recent months. Legislators and political candidates are focusing on leading technology platforms, often demanding more aggressive enforcement and sometimes going so far as to suggest breaking up specific companies, unwinding consummated mergers and applying more stringent standards to acquisitions and business practices in technology markets. Most immediately relevant, antitrust enforcers seem to be directing additional resources into investigations in this space. A successful enforcement action against one or more of the leading digital platforms or the imposition of a new regulatory framework could lead to significant changes in the technology sector. Antitrust enforcers have expressed the view that the existing legal framework is sufficiently flexible to address dynamic technology markets, while simultaneously noting that potential enforcement efforts in this sector, as in any other, are bound by the facts presented and thus may in some instances face hurdles. Thus, while the increased interest of lawmakers may lead to more or longer investigations in the high-tech sector and may create additional emphasis on such investigations by the antitrust agencies, it remains to be seen which business strategies and proposed acquisitions in the tech sector ultimately will be the subject of enforcement actions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AGENCY ACTIVITY</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both US federal agencies as well as state enforcers appear to be increasing their focus on competition in digital markets.</p><p>It has been widely reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have approved a \"clearance agreement\" to divide responsibility for investigating the \"big four\" technology companies, with DOJ responsible for Google and Apple and the FTC responsible for Amazon and Facebook.1 Neither agency has confirmed the reports and indeed Bruce Hoffman has told the media, \"I would be skeptical and cautious about any media story indicating there is some allocation of companies. That would be atypical of the way we clear matters.\"2</p><p>The FTC has hosted a series of hearings on competition and consumer protection where the topic of competition in digital markets was prominent,3 and recently Commissioner Chopra argued that \"[o]ver the past decade, we have watched the decentralized internet converge under a handful of corporate umbrellas,\" and suggested that \"[w]e should all be asking whether tech convergence is choking off competition in markets where platform and content intersect.\"4</p><p>The FTC recently launched a \"Technology Task Force,\" which is \"dedicated to monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets, investigating any potential anticompetitive conduct in those markets, and taking enforcement actions when warranted.\"5 The Task Force, unlike most FTC sections, appears to have responsibility for both mergers (proposed and consummated6) and conduct investigations.7 Patricia Galvan, the head of the Task Force, has confirmed that investigations are underway.8 In a filing with the SEC, Facebook acknowledged that the FTC opened an antitrust investigation of the company in June 2019.9</p><p>Similarly, the DOJ has engaged repeatedly on this topic. A press release on July 23, 2019 confirmed that the \"Justice Department [is] reviewing the practices of market-leading online platforms.\"10 Earlier, the DOJ held a public workshop with a high-tech focus last month,11 and Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim recently offered his views regarding \"digital gatekeepers\" and the DOJ approach to antitrust enforcement in technology markets. Delrahim promised to pursue enforcement against antitrust violations in the sector and offered the view that certain technology markets (such as search, social networks, operating systems, e-books, and online advertising) appear to have only one or two major competitors. He also analogized antitrust enforcement against digital sector participants to landmark monopolization cases such as Standard Oil, AT&amp;T (1974), and Microsoft.12 Jeffrey Wilder, the DOJ's chief economist, has recently suggested that DOJ may give closer scrutiny to incumbent platforms that attempt to acquire start-ups in adjacent markets and consider monopolization theories in the acquisition context as well as in potential standalone conduct investigations.13</p><p>State enforcers are also focusing more on competition in digital markets. Forty-three state attorneys general recently encouraged the FTC to emphasize \"non-price aspects of competition\"including impacts on privacy as a way to increase enforcement against potentially anticompetitive acquisitions by technology platforms.14 Moreover, Attorney General William Barr also reportedly met with a group of eight bipartisan state attorneys general to discuss antitrust topics related to the tech sector.15 Multiple state attorneys general have also voiced interest in independently investigating and challenging conduct and acquisitions by major technology platforms.16 The Attorneys General for Nebraska and Louisiana gave a joint interview in which they described broad, bipartisan interest in investigating major tech companies.17 Similarly, the Attorney General for Tennessee suggested that \". . . structural change driven by the government may well be necessary\" to address concerns about concentration in this space.18</p><p>European competition authorities have been even more focused on digital competition. EC Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager recently suggested that dominant technology platforms are \"a different beast\" and thus require a different approach than other companies.19 Vestager argued that platforms leverage masses of data that smaller rivals and new entrants cannot match and thus not only competition enforcement but also regulation will be necessary for \"governments to reassert control of parts of the digital world.\"20 German competition enforcers have suggested that laws could be changed to allow for enforcement against platforms that have non-dominant power in multiple markets if other companies are nonetheless dependent upon them.21 Other European authorities have also advocated for a more regulatory approach; for example, the Chairman of ARCEP, the French telecommunications regulatory authority, suggested that the largest technology companies should be regulated as public utilities.22</p><p>Most recently, the EC has taken the very unusual step of publishing a Statement of Objections to support imposing so-called \"interim measures\" in connection with its recently opened investigation of Broadcom. These measures will block certain exclusivity provisions, based on the preliminary finding of the EC that \"Broadcom's conduct may result in the elimination or marginalisation of competitors before the end of [full] proceedings.\"23 This effort to halt conduct before a final conclusion is reached in the investigation appears to be a reflection of the EC's increasingly aggressive approach in the technology sector.</p><p>Other jurisdictions around the world have also committed more resources and attention to antitrust scrutiny of large technology platform companies. For example, Australia has established a special office of the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission dedicated to policing Facebook and Google on a range of issues including competition, algorithms, \"fake news,\" and hate speech.24</p><p>CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS</p><p>There is increased Congressional interest in these issues as well. The House Judiciary Committee has announced a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust investigation into digital competition issues.25 A series of hearings, interviews, and depositions is scheduled to last approximately 18 months.26 After the hearing was announced, Congressman David Cicilline (D-RI), Chair of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, expressed displeasure with the state of antitrust law and enforcement in the high-tech sector, offering the view that \"Congress has retreated\" from shaping U.S. antitrust laws, and instead \"allow[ed] the laws to become more technical, less effective, and altogether less democratic in the hands of the courts.\"27 Representative Cicilline described the state of antitrust enforcement as \"a failure by everyone\" and argued that \"[t]here hasn't been a serious investigation in 20 years, and we want to understand why.\"28</p><p>In addition, the Senate Judiciary Committee also announced an antitrust oversight hearing for July 23, 2019, but that was postponed until September 17, 2019.29 Separately, seven Senators, led by Senator Klobuchar (D-MN), Ranking Member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, sent letters to the DOJ and FTC requesting that the agencies disclose any existing conduct investigations into Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. The letters also ask the agencies to commit to issuing public statements explaining their findings and the outcome of any such investigations.30</p><p>CAMPAIGN PROMISES AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS</p><p>Rhetoric encouraging enforcement against digital platforms has increased across the political spectrum. President Trump previously has suggested that digital platforms are politically biased, and recently suggested that US antitrust enforcement should be more vigorous in its approach to major platform companies. He noted EC efforts in this regard and said \"we should be doing what they're doing.\"31</p><p>On March 8, 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) released a proposal to \"break up big tech.\"32 The proposal would require large digital platforms to adhere to certain conduct requirements (such as non-discrimination) and would prohibit them from owning businesses that operate on their platforms.33 Senator Warren's plan also includes unwinding some recent acquisitions by major platforms, such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.34 Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) also indicated his support for breaking large technology companies,35 and other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, including Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Andrew Yang have backed a \"break up big tech\" plank as well.36</p><p>Senator Klobuchar has characterized previous investigations into large technology companies as inadequate37and has proposed modifying the Clayton Act to make it easier to block proposed acquisitions; deals could be blocked if they are found to \"materially lessen competition,\"38 which is intended to be a lesser standard than the current \"substantially lessen competition\" standard. Senator Klobuchar's proposal would also shift the burden of proof in what her proposal designates as \"mega-mergers\"39 to require that the parties prove that such transactions do not harm competition.40 The proposed legislation also modifies the Clayton Act to prohibit transactions that tend to create a monopsony in a specific line of commerce.41 Recently, Senator Klobuchar has introduced another bill to authorize civil monetary penalties for Section 2 violations.42 The penalties could be as high as 15% of the defendant's total US revenues or 30% of their revenues in the relevant markets.43</p><p>What Does This All Mean in Practice?</p><p>It remains to be seen what enforcement actions will emerge in the coming months or whether any proposal to reform the existing antitrust laws or to impose a regulatory framework on digital platforms ultimately will come to fruition. But the agencies do not embrace the view that reforms are a necessary predicate to enforcement. AAG Delrahim recently noted his view that \"U.S. antitrust law is flexible enough to be applied to markets old and new.\"44 FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson \"emphatically reject[s] any suggestion that these [high-tech] markets are different enough to warrant different treatment.\"45 And the competition authorities of the G7 released a \"Common Understanding\" on \"Competition and the Digital Economy\" on June 5, 2019 that emphasizes \"[t]he flexibility and relevance of existing antitrust rules.\"46</p><p>Even while the agencies increase their emphasis on competition in technology markets they remain focused on the practical requirements of bringing a successful enforcement action. FTC Chairman Joseph Simons recently emphasized, \"as a law enforcement agency, [the FTC is] constrained by the parameters of our authorizing statute and the facts of the case in front of us.\"47 Principal DAAG Andrew Finch made a similar point in a speech to the OECD, while noting some of the challenges associated with bringing a successful action in the high-tech sector.48 And Enforcers have voiced reservations about drastic measures like \"breaking up big tech\" and utility regulation.49</p><p>Nonetheless, the antitrust authorities do seem to be more interested in the high-tech space and particularly platform competition and are investing additional resources to assess such competition issues. This increased interest may already be leading to more investigations, and if the antitrust agencies are concerned about competition in particular markets, they may be more inclined to dig deeper and investigate longer in these market segments. Of course, additional scrutiny does not necessarily mean that new enforcement actions will materialize, but it is worth watching carefully to see whether any new challenges develop under the current framework, and whether that framework itself is shifted by lawmakers around the world.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p>\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information ``has exploded into a data industrial complex.''</p><p>``Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,'' he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users increasingly extreme content that hardens their convictions,'' Cook said.</p><p>``This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich only the companies that collect them,'' he said.</p><p>Cook's appearance seems set to one-up his tech rivals and show off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google.</p><p>``With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,'' said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance ``is going to have good currency,'' with officials, he added.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai were scheduled to address by video the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs. Only Cook attended in person.</p><p>He has repeatedly said privacy is a ``fundamental human right'' and vowed his company wouldn't sell ads based on customer data the way companies like Facebook do.</p><p>His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation efforts.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it beefed up data privacy regulations by launching GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LEIPZO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKM-0J41-JB5P-J2N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 29, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue.</p><p>\"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information ``has exploded into a data industrial complex.''</p><p>``Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,'' he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users increasingly extreme content that hardens their convictions,'' Cook said.</p><p>``This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich only the companies that collect them,'' he said.</p><p>Cook's appearance seems set to one-up his tech rivals and show off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google.</p><p>``With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,'' said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance ``is going to have good currency,'' with officials, he added.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai were scheduled to address by video the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs. Only Cook attended in person.</p><p>He has repeatedly said privacy is a ``fundamental human right'' and vowed his company wouldn't sell ads based on customer data the way companies like Facebook do.</p><p>His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation efforts.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it beefed up data privacy regulations by launching GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2126122904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFJ-JP91-DY0W-451Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Thai News Service Group Oct 29, 2018</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 29, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

He said the trade in personal information ``has exploded into a data industrial complex.''</p><p>``Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,'' he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users increasingly extreme content that hardens their convictions,'' Cook said.</p><p>``This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich only the companies that collect them,'' he said.</p><p>Cook's appearance seems set to one-up his tech rivals and show off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google.</p><p>``With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,'' said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance ``is going to have good currency,'' with officials, he added.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai were scheduled to address by video the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs. Only Cook attended in person.</p><p>He has repeatedly said privacy is a ``fundamental human right'' and vowed his company wouldn't sell ads based on customer data the way companies like Facebook do.</p><p>His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation efforts.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it beefed up data privacy regulations by launching GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2126122272</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF9-C1C1-DY0W-4123-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Thai News Service Group Oct 29, 2018</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 29, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The 116th U.S. Congress saw a record number of bills related to AI in 2019the Filter Bubble Transparency Act being the latestand in the final quarter of 2019 the Trump administration continued to take tentative steps towards articulating a \"light-touch\" federal policy that balances safety and innovation, collaboration and protectionism, whilst being sufficiently technically detailed to allow federal agencies to consider their regulatory response. California continues to buck the national trend and has taken legislative action to prohibit, among other things, the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the EU is preparing to deliver much-anticipated draft AI legislation in early 2020, but has, as we discuss below, already taken a firm stance in favor of regulation that is broad in scope, focused on ethics, individual rights and corporate accountability, and \"horizontally\" applicable across industries, rather than specific sectorsin other words, GDPR-style principles of governance that are in many respects diametrically opposed to U.S. federal policy, which eschews the EU's \"regulate-first\" approach.</p><p>As we will address in more detail in our forthcoming 2019 Annual Legal Review of Artificial Intelligence and Automated Systems, these fast-moving global developments will have a significant impact on companies developing or operating AI products in the EU.</p><p>I. Key U.S. Legislative and Regulatory Developments</p><p>A. FILTER BUBBLE TRANSPARENCY ACT, S. 2763</p><p>On October 31, 2019 a bipartisan group of senators introduced the Filter Bubble Transparency Act, the first substantive federal bill aimed at regulating algorithmic control of content on internet platforms. If enacted, the bill would require large-scale internet platforms to provide greater transparency to consumers by providing clear notice on the use, and enabling consumers to opt out, of personalized content curated by \"opaque\" algorithms so that they can \"engage with a platform without being manipulated by algorithms driven by user-specific data\"1 and \"simply opt out of the filter bubble.\"2 \"Filter bubble\" refers to a zone of potential manipulation that exists within algorithms that curate or rank content in internet platforms based on user-specific data, potentially creating digital \"echo chambers.\"3 Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., one of the bill's sponsors, explained that the bill is intended to facilitate \"a better understanding of how internet platforms use artificial intelligence and opaque algorithms to make inferences from the reams of personal data at their fingertips that can be used to affect behavior and influence outcomes.\"4</p><p>The proposed legislation covers \"any public-facing website, internet application, or mobile application,\" such as social network sites, video sharing services, search engines and content aggregation services5, and generally would prohibit the use of opaque algorithms on platforms without those platforms having first provided notice in a \"clear, conspicuous manner on the platform whenever the user interacts with an opaque algorithm for the first time.\" The term \"opaque algorithm\" is defined as \"an algorithmic ranking system6 that determines the order or manner that information is furnished to a user on a covered internet platform based, in whole or part, on user-specific data that was not expressly provided by the user to the platform\" in order to interact with it.7 Examples of \"user-specific\" data include the user's history of web searches and browsing, geographical locations, physical activity, device interaction, and financial transactions.8 Conversely, data that was expressly provided to the platform by the user for the purpose of interacting with the platformsuch as search terms, saved preferences, an explicitly entered geographical location or the user's social media profiles9is considered \"user-supplied.\"</p><p>Additionally, the bill requires that users be given the option to choose to view content based on \"input-transparent algorithms,\" a purportedly generic algorithmic ranking system that \"does not use the user-specific data of a user to determine the order or manner that information is furnished to such user on a covered platform,\"10 and be able to easily switch between the opaque and the input-transparent versions.11 By way of example, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), another co-sponsor of the bill, explained that \"this legislation would give consumers the choice to decide whether they want to use the algorithm or view content in the order it was posted.\"12 However, there is nothing in the bill that would require platforms to disclose the use of algorithms unless they are using hyper-personal \"user-specific\" data for customization, and even \"input-transparent\" algorithms using \"user-supplied\" data would not necessarily show content in chronological order. Nor would platforms be required to disclose any source code or explain how the algorithms used work. As drafted, the bill's goals of providing transparency and protecting consumers from algorithmic manipulation by \"opting out\" of personalized content appear to be overstated, and lawmakers will need to grapple with the proposed definitions to clarify the scope of the bill's provisions.13</p><p>Much like the Algorithmic Accountability Act, discussed in more detail in our Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems Legal Update (1Q19), the bill is squarely targeted at \"Big Tech\" platformsit would not apply to platforms wholly owned, controlled and operated by a person that did not employ more than 500 employees in the past six months, averaged less than $50 million in annual gross receipts, and annually collects or processes personal data of less than a million individuals.14 Violations of the Act would be enforced with civil penalties by the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") but, unlike the Algorithmic Accountability Act, the bill does not grant state attorneys general the right to bring civil suits for violations, nor expressly state that its provisions do not preempt state laws.</p><p>We will continue to monitor the bill, which is co-sponsored by four members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, as it makes its way through Congress.</p><p>B. NSCAI REPORT ON U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY</p><p>On November 4, 2019, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (\"NSCAI\")  which was tasked by Congress to research ways to advance the development of AI for national security and defense purposes  released a much-anticipated interim report specifying five key areas where it said U.S. policy can improve in order to transition AI from \"a promising technological novelty into a mature technology integrated into core national security missions.\"15 Eric Schmidt, the chairman of the commission and the former head of Google's parent company Alphabet, noted that the commission worked with a number of U.S. government departments and agencies including the intelligence community, academia and the private sector, as well as allied partners such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and Australia. Across all five principles, NSCAI said that ethical and responsible development and deployment of AI is a top priority, and noted that it is still developing best practices for operationalizing AI technologies that are trustworthy, explainable, and free of unwanted bias.</p><p>The five lines of effort are: invest in research and development; apply the technology to national security missions; train and recruit AI talent; protect and build upon U.S. technology advantages; and marshal global cooperation on artificial intelligence issues.</p><p>The commission's preliminary conclusion is that the U.S. \"is not translating broad national AI strengths and AI strategy statements into specific national security advantages.\"16 Notably, the commission reported that federal R&amp;D funding has not kept pace with the potential of AI technologies, noting that the requested fiscal year 2020 federal funding for core AI research outside of the defense sector grew by less than 2 percent from the estimated 2019 levels.17 Further, it noted that AI is not realizing its potential to execute core national security missions because agencies are failing to embrace the technology as a result of \"bureaucratic impediments and inertia.\"18 NSCAI also criticized the shortage of AI talent in government agencies, specifically in the Department of Defense (\"DoD\"). It made workforce development recommendations to federal agencies, including undertaking more widespread use of AI technologies, and improving training on basic AI principles.19 The commission asserted that the U.S. has a global technological advantage in terms of AI implementation, but also warned that China is rapidly closing the gap.20 NSCAI recommended export controls to protect AI hardware,21 and preservation of an open research system with U.S. academia. Finally, the commission said the U.S. should lead creation of AI norms worldwide by fostering international collaboration and establishing a network of allies dedicated to AI data sharing, R&amp;D coordination, capacity building, and talent exchanges.22 The commission also notes that it is exploring possible avenues for \"AI-related diplomatic discussions with rivals such as China and Russia\" in areas such as AI safety in order to protect common interests, promote responsible research and innovation, and limit dangerous uses.23</p><p>NSCAI is set to release its final report and recommendationswhich will likely contain additional insights into U.S. federal policy regarding AI in March 2021.</p><p>C. U.S. IMPOSES EXPORT CONTROLS ON CHINESE AI COMPANIES</p><p>On October 7, 2019, BIS announced that it will add 28 Chinese governmental and commercial organizations to the Entity List for engaging in or enabling activities contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States.24 The regulation includes China's leading AI companies, including Sense Time, Megvii Technology, Yitu, and Dahua Technology. Companies are required to comply with the notice as of the effective date, although it includes a standard \"savings clause\" exempting items that are already en route as of October 9, 2019. The Secretary of Commerce stated that this action was in response to \"the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China[.]\"25</p><p>D. CALIFORNIA'S SWEEPING ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE AI</p><p>1. Two New California Laws Ban Certain Deepfake Videos</p><p>As we previously reported in our Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems Legal Update (3Q19), in the wake of a June 2019 hearing by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on the national security challenges of artificial intelligence, manipulated media, and deepfake technology, both the House and the Senate introduced legislation to regulate deepfakes. While those bills remains pending, California has taken action to restrict the specific use of deepfakes to influence elections and non-consensual pornographic deepfakes. On October 3, 2019 California's Gov. Newsom signed a bill (A.B. 730) banning anyone \"from distributing with actual malice materially deceptive audio or visual media of the candidate\" within 60 days of an election with the intent to injure the candidate's reputation or deceive a voter into voting for or against the candidate.26 This measure exempts print and online media and websites if that entity clearly discloses that the deepfake video or audio file is inaccurate or of questionable authenticity. On October 3, Gov. Newsom also signed a bill (A.B. 602) banning pornographic deepfakes made without consent of the person depicted, creating a private right of action.27 The law excepts \"[c]ommentary, criticism, or disclosure that is otherwise protected by the California Constitution or the United States Constitution.\"</p><p>It will remain to be seen whether these laws will be challenged and whether they will pass Constitutional muster. Regardless, the use and proliferation of deepfakes will likely face greater legal and regulatory scrutiny at both federal and state level going forward, and may impact technology platforms which permit users to upload, share or link content.</p><p>2. California Limits Police Body Camera Facial Recognition Technology</p><p>On October 8, Gov. Newsom signed bill A.B. 1215,28 which places a three-year moratorium on any facial recognition technology used in police body cameras beginning January 1, 2020. This development follows San Francisco and Oakland bans on police use of facial recognition technology, as reported in our Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems Legal Update (2Q19). The language of A.B. 1215 states that using biometric surveillance violates constitutional rights because it is the \"functional equivalent\" of requiring people to carry identification at all times.29 The new law further regulates the collection of personal information, sounds in California's concern for overly broad collection of information, and may influence modifications to the California Consumer Privacy Act 2018 (\"CCPA\") regarding facial recognition (such as A.B. 1281, which would require businesses to give conspicuous notices where facial recognition technology is employed).</p><p>3. California AG Releases New California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Proposed Regulations</p><p>As reported in our client alert California Consumer Privacy Act: 2019 Final Amendments Signed, on October 10, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued new draft regulations operationalizing the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"). The CCPA has been described as one of the most stringent state privacy laws and will affect AI technologies that are driven by personal data. We have previously published a summary of the CCPA as well as its initial amendments, and stand ready to advise companies who utilize or develop such technologies on the potential implications of CCPA within the AI space.</p><p>E. EC PROMISES \"GDPR\"-STYLE REGULATION OF AI</p><p>As reported in our Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems Legal Update (3Q19), European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to propose legislation to address the human and ethical implications of AI in the first quarter of 2020.30 In a speech at the European Parliament on November 27, 2019, von der Leyen said that she was in favor of AI-focused legislation similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\").31 The Commission is likely to draw on the work of its high-level expert group on AI, which outlined a series of principles earlier this year aimed at ensuring companies deploy artificial intelligence in a way that is fair, safe and accountable.32 The principles, developed by a committee of academics and industry representatives, form part of the EU's plan to increase public and private investment in AI to 20 billion per year.</p><p>We will monitor any further statements by the EC and provide updates on any proposed legislation as it becomes available. As we previously addressed in more detail in \"Gearing Up for the EU's Next Regulatory Push: AI,\"33 given the stringent requirements of the GDPR, future EC regulations are likely to stand in contrast to the current U.S. \"light-touch\" regulatory approach and could have a significant impact on companies developing or operating AI products within the EU.</p><p>II. Bias/Ethics and Technology Bans</p><p>A. GERMAN DATA ETHICS COMMISSION REPORT</p><p>On October 23, 2019, Germany's Data Ethics Commission released a landmark 240-page report containing 75 recommendations for regulating data, algorithmic systems and AI.34 Consistent with EC President Ursula von der Leyen's recent remarks discussed above, the report suggests that EU regulation of AI may mirror the approach espoused in the GDPR  broad in scope, focused on individual rights and corporate accountability, and \"horizontally\" applicable across industries, rather than specific sectors.35 Expanding on the EU's non-binding \"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI,\" the commission concludes that \"regulation is necessary, and cannot be replaced by ethical principles.\"36</p><p>The commission creates a blueprint for the implementation of binding legal rules for AInominally both at national and EU levelon a sliding scale based on the risk of harm across five levels of algorithmic systems, with a focus on the degree of potential harm rather than differentiating between specific use cases. While systems posing a negligible or low likelihood of harm would not require any new regulatory obligations, those with at least \"some\" potential for harm would be subject to a mandatory labeling scheme that indicates where and how algorithms are being used within the system, and a risk assessment that evaluates the system's effect on privacy rights, self-determination, bodily or personal integrity, assets and ownership rights, and discrimination, among other factors. For systems that curate content based on user data, such as personalized pricing algorithms, the commission recommends prior authorization by supervisory institutions, and heightened oversight (such as live monitoring) and transparency obligations systems with \"regular or significant potential for harm,\" which include determinations about consumer creditworthiness. The commission recommended a full or partial ban on systems with an \"untenable potential for harm.\"37</p><p>Of particular relevance to companies deploying AI software, the report recommends that measures be taken against \"ethically indefensible uses of data,\" such as \"total surveillance, profiling that poses a threat to personal integrity, the targeted exploitation of vulnerabilities, addictive designs and dark patterns, methods of influencing political elections that are incompatible with the principle of democracy, vendor lock-in and systematic consumer detriment, and many practices that involve trading in personal data.\"38</p><p>The commission also recommends that human operators of algorithmic systems be held vicariously liable for any harm caused by autonomous technology, and calls for an overhaul of existing product liability and strict liability laws as they pertain to algorithmic products and services.39</p><p>While the report's pro-regulation approach is a counterweight to the \"light-touch' regulation favored by the U.S. government, the commission takes the view that, far from impeding private sector innovation, regulation can provide much-needed certainty to companies developing, testing, and deploying innovative AI products.40 Certainly, the commission's guiding principlesamong them the need to ensure \"the human-centred and value-oriented design of technology\"41reinforce that European lawmakers are likely to regulate AI development comprehensively and decisively. While it remains to be seen to what extent the forthcoming draft EU legislation will adopt the commission's recommendations, all signs point to a sweeping regulatory regime that could significantly impact technology companies active in the EU.</p><p>B. NEW DOD ETHICS FRAMEWORK</p><p>On October 31, 2019, the Defense Innovation Board (\"DIB\"), an independent federal advisory committee to the Pentagon consisting of a group of science and technology experts led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, proposed a new ethics framework consisting of five overarching ethical principles which tie the Department of Defense's (\"DOD\") existing laws of war and rules of engagement42 into the use of AI.43</p><p>The report is a high-level blueprint for military deployments of artificial intelligence and addresses some general shortcomings of AI technology.44 The principles advocate for deliberate AI designs to counter unintended biases that could cause inadvertent harm and for humans to have the power to deactivate or disengage AI systems acting outside the intended parameters. The board also suggested that humans should always be responsible for the \"development, deployment, use and outcomes\" of AI rather than letting AI set its own standards of use: \"Governability is important because operators and users of AI systems should understand the potential consequences of deploying the system or system of systems to its full extent, which may lead to unintended harmful outcomes.\" In these cases, DOD should not use that AI system because \"it does not achieve mission objectives in an ethical or responsible manner.\"45</p><p>The DIB also recommended a number of technical and organizational measures that would help lay the groundwork to ensure military artificial intelligence systems adhere to ethical standards, such as increasing investment in standards development, workforce programs and AI security applications, and formalizing channels for exploring the ethical implications of deploying AI technology across the department.</p><p>The report follows concerns that most AI-related innovation is being developed by commercial technology firms rather than its internal research or traditional industrial base, and that some firms are reluctant to take on defense contracts at least in part due to ethical conflicts.46 The newly proposed ethics framework could help address private sector concerns about innovative technology being wrongly weaponized or misused by the military or being part of autonomous systems without sufficient human oversight. However, the report's recommendations are not binding, and Pentagon leaders will need to decide whether to enact the board's recommendations into concrete policy going forward.</p><p>III. Intellectual Property Law</p><p>A. USPTO REQUEST FOR COMMENT</p><p>Intellectual property issues related to AI have also been at the forefront of the new technology, as record numbers of U.S. patent applications involve a form of machine learning component. As we reported previously in our Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems Legal Update (4Q18), in January 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") released revised guidance relating to subject matter eligibly for patents and on the application of 35 U.S.C. 112 on computer implemented inventions. On the heels of that guidance, on August 27, 2019, the USPTO published a request for public comment on several patent-related issues regarding AI inventions.47 The request for comment posed twelve questions covering several topics from \"patent examination policy to whether new forms of intellectual property protection are needed.\" The questions included topics such whether patent laws, which contemplate only human inventors, should be amended to allow entities other than a human being to be considered an inventor.48 The commenting period was extended until November 8, 2019, and many of the comments submitted argue that ownership of patent rights should remain reserved for only natural or juridical persons.49</p><p>On December 13, 2019, the World Intellectual Property Organization (\"WIPO\") published a draft issue paper on IP policy and AI, and requested comments on several areas of IP, including patents and data, and, similarly to the USPTO before it, with regard to issues of inventorship and ownership.50 The commenting period is set to end on February 14, 2020.</p><p>Footnote</p><p> 1 Filter Bubble Transparency Act, S. 2763, 116th Cong.

The proposal would not only roll back restrictions that keep broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T from blocking or collecting tolls from services they don't like, it would bar states from imposing their own rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broadband industry promises that the internet experience isn't going to change, but its companies have lobbied hard to overturn these rules. Protests have erupted online and in the streets as everyday Americans worry that cable and phone companies will be able to control what they see and do online.</p><p>That growing public movement suggests that the FCC vote won't be the end of the issue. Opponents of the move plan legal challenges, and some net-neutrality supporters hope to ride that wave of public opinion into the 2018 elections.</p><p>Concern about FCC plan</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says his plan eliminates unnecessary regulation that stood in the way of connecting more Americans to the internet. Under his proposal, the Comcasts and AT&amp;Ts of the world will be free to block rival apps, slow down competing service or offer faster speeds to companies who pay up. They just have to post their policies online or tell the FCC.</p><p>The change also axes consumer protections, bars state laws that contradict the FCC's approach, and largely transfers oversight of internet service to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>After the FCC released its plan in late November, well-known telecom and media analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to investors that the FCC plan dismantles \"virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.\"</p><p>That could result in phone and cable companies forcing people to pay more to do what they want online. The technology community, meanwhile, fears that additional online tolls could hurt startups who can't afford to pay them - and, over the long term, diminish innovation.</p><p>\"We're a small company. We're about 40 people. We don't have the deep pockets of Google, Netflix, Amazon to just pay off ISPs to make sure consumers can access our service,\" said Andrew McCollum, CEO of streaming-TV service Philo.</p><p>ISPs: Trust us</p><p>Broadband providers pooh-pooh what they characterize as misinformation and irrational fears. \"I genuinely look forward to the weeks, months, years ahead when none of the fire and brimstone predictions comes to pass,\" said Jonathan Spalter, head of the trade group USTelecom, on a call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p>But some of these companies have suggested they could charge some internet services more to reach customers, saying it could allow for better delivery of new services like telemedicine. Comcast said Wednesday it has no plans for such agreements.</p><p>Cable and mobile providers have also been less scrupulous in the past. In 2007, for example, the Associated Press found Comcast was blocking or throttling some file-sharing. AT&amp;T blocked Skype and other internet calling services on the iPhone until 2009. They also aren't backing away from subtler forms of discrimination that favor their own services.</p><p>There's also a problem with the FCC's plan to leave most complaints about deceptive behavior and privacy to the FTC. A pending court case could leave the FTC without the legal authority to oversee most big broadband providers. That could leave both agencies hamstrung if broadband companies hurt their customers or competitors.</p><p>Critics like Democratic FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny argue that the FTC won't be as effective in policing broadband companies as the FCC, which has expertise in the issue and has the ability to lay down hard-and-fast rules against certain practices.</p><p>Public outcry</p><p>Moffett and Nathanson, the analysts, said that they suspect the latest FCC rules to be short-lived. \"These changes will likely be so immensely unpopular that it would be shocking if they are allowed to stand for long,\" they wrote.</p><p>There have been hundreds of public protests against Pai's plan and more than 1 million calls to Congress through a pro-net neutrality coalition's site. Smaller tech websites such as Reddit, Kickstarter and Mozilla put dramatic overlays on their sites Tuesday in support of net neutrality. Twitter on Wednesday was promoting #NetNeutrality as a trending topic. Other big tech companies were more muted in their support.</p><p>Public-interest groups Free Press and Public Knowledge are already promising to go after Pai's rules in the courts. There may also be attempts to legislate net neutrality rules, which the telecom industry supports. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, on Tuesday called for \"bipartisan legislation\" on net neutrality that would \"enshrine protections for consumers with the backing of law.\"</p><p>But that will be tough going. Democrats criticized previous Republican attempts at legislation during the Obama administration for gutting the FCC's enforcement abilities. Republicans would likely be interested in proposing even weaker legislation now, and Democrats are unlikely to support it if so.</p><p>Some Democrats prefer litigation and want to use Republican opposition to net neutrality as a campaign issue in 2018. \"Down the road Congress could act to put in place new rules, but with Republicans in charge of the House, Senate, and White House the likelihood of strong enforceable rules are small,\" Rep.

The proposal would not only roll back restrictions that keep broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T from blocking or collecting tolls from services they don't like, it would bar states from imposing their own rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broadband industry promises that the internet experience isn't going to change, but its companies have lobbied hard to overturn these rules. Protests have erupted online and in the streets as everyday Americans worry that cable and phone companies will be able to control what they see and do online.</p><p>That growing public movement suggests that the FCC vote won't be the end of the issue. Opponents of the move plan legal challenges, and some net-neutrality supporters hope to ride that wave of public opinion into the 2018 elections.</p><p>Concern about FCC plan</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says his plan eliminates unnecessary regulation that stood in the way of connecting more Americans to the internet. Under his proposal, the Comcasts and AT&amp;Ts of the world will be free to block rival apps, slow down competing service or offer faster speeds to companies who pay up. They just have to post their policies online or tell the FCC.</p><p>The change also axes consumer protections, bars state laws that contradict the FCC's approach, and largely transfers oversight of internet service to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>After the FCC released its plan in late November, well-known telecom and media analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to investors that the FCC plan dismantles \"virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.\"</p><p>That could result in phone and cable companies forcing people to pay more to do what they want online. The technology community, meanwhile, fears that additional online tolls could hurt startups who can't afford to pay them - and, over the long term, diminish innovation.</p><p>\"We're a small company. We're about 40 people. We don't have the deep pockets of Google, Netflix, Amazon to just pay off ISPs to make sure consumers can access our service,\" said Andrew McCollum, CEO of streaming-TV service Philo.</p><p>ISPs: Trust us</p><p>Broadband providers pooh-pooh what they characterize as misinformation and irrational fears. \"I genuinely look forward to the weeks, months, years ahead when none of the fire and brimstone predictions comes to pass,\" said Jonathan Spalter, head of the trade group USTelecom, on a call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p>But some of these companies have suggested they could charge some internet services more to reach customers, saying it could allow for better delivery of new services like telemedicine. Comcast said Wednesday it has no plans for such agreements.</p><p>Cable and mobile providers have also been less scrupulous in the past. In 2007, for example, the Associated Press found Comcast was blocking or throttling some file-sharing. AT&amp;T blocked Skype and other internet calling services on the iPhone until 2009. They also aren't backing away from subtler forms of discrimination that favor their own services.</p><p>There's also a problem with the FCC's plan to leave most complaints about deceptive behavior and privacy to the FTC. A pending court case could leave the FTC without the legal authority to oversee most big broadband providers. That could leave both agencies hamstrung if broadband companies hurt their customers or competitors.</p><p>Critics like Democratic FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny argue that the FTC won't be as effective in policing broadband companies as the FCC, which has expertise in the issue and has the ability to lay down hard-and-fast rules against certain practices.</p><p>Public outcry</p><p>Moffett and Nathanson, the analysts, said that they suspect the latest FCC rules to be short-lived. \"These changes will likely be so immensely unpopular that it would be shocking if they are allowed to stand for long,\" they wrote.</p><p>There have been hundreds of public protests against Pai's plan and more than 1 million calls to Congress through a pro-net neutrality coalition's site. Smaller tech websites such as Reddit, Kickstarter and Mozilla put dramatic overlays on their sites Tuesday in support of net neutrality. Twitter on Wednesday was promoting #NetNeutrality as a trending topic. Other big tech companies were more muted in their support.</p><p>Public-interest groups Free Press and Public Knowledge are already promising to go after Pai's rules in the courts. There may also be attempts to legislate net neutrality rules, which the telecom industry supports. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, on Tuesday called for \"bipartisan legislation\" on net neutrality that would \"enshrine protections for consumers with the backing of law.\"</p><p>But that will be tough going. Democrats criticized previous Republican attempts at legislation during the Obama administration for gutting the FCC's enforcement abilities. Republicans would likely be interested in proposing even weaker legislation now, and Democrats are unlikely to support it if so.</p><p>Some Democrats prefer litigation and want to use Republican opposition to net neutrality as a campaign issue in 2018. \"Down the road Congress could act to put in place new rules, but with Republicans in charge of the House, Senate, and White House the likelihood of strong enforceable rules are small,\" Rep. Mike Doyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, wrote on Reddit last week. \"Maybe after the 2018 elections, we will be in a stronger position to get that done.\"</p><p>A future FCC could also rewrite net-neutrality regulation to be tougher on the phone and cable industry. That could bring a whole new cycle of litigation by broadband companies. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-1977650121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF8-W8B1-DY0W-4548-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"996\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Thai News Service Group Dec 18, 2017</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 18, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum - especially Director Elaine Didier - for hosting today's event. I'd also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today. </p><p>It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century - that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future. </p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that [t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.[1] Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[2] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party. </p><p>It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America's reengagement with the People's Republic of China, which began with President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong. </p><p>At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people .... This last impression-of the reality of China's colossal potential-is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.[3] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass. </p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto: hide your strength and bide your time.[4] That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American Dream with the Chinese solution.[5] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg-an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party's Made in China 2025 initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, Made in China 2025 sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.  </p><p>Made in China 2025 is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China. </p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats. </p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Although billed as foreign aid, in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism. </p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its Digital Silk Road initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world's chess grandmasters. But the PRC's interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan, a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[6] Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China, in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[7] </p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us.</p><p>As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer - allowing us to serve as the world's arsenal of democracy. China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's arsenal of dictatorship.</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion. </p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.[8] The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers - including American companies - from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.</p><p>China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively creating their own competitors.[9] </p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as APIs. As one Defense Health Agency official noted, [s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States], it could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.[10] </p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a high-value-added-industry and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[11] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies. </p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, [t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.[12]</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps. </p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.[13] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence-even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion. </p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the Ancient One, a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.[14] Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say [w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.[15]</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party. </p><p>The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market-both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier. </p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood-and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, [e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.[16] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. </p><p>In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.[17] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China-the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud. </p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives - efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view. </p><p>As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a friendly face on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed. </p><p>America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the guanxi - or system of influential social networks-necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the agents of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[18] </p><p>These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes, which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands. </p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength. </p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. </p><p>There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. </p><p>But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a stupid mistake.[19] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks. </p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell - later Justice Powell - sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. [T]he time has come, he said, indeed, it is long overdue-for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.[20]</p><p>So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement. </p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.[21] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule. </p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before. If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we-the American people, American government, and American business together-can do it again. Our freedom depends on it. </p><p>Source: U.S. Department of Justice</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2424771337</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D3-HGM1-JBHT-D212-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Communist Party-China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gerald R Ford Presidential Museum &amp;

I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum - especially Director Elaine Didier - for hosting today's event. I'd also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today.</p><p>It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century - that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future.</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that [t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.[1] Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[2] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party.</p><p>It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America's reengagement with the People's Republic of China, which began with President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people .... This last impression-of the reality of China's colossal potential-is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.[3] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto: hide your strength and bide your time.[4] That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American Dream with the Chinese solution.[5] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg-an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party's Made in China 2025 initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, Made in China 2025 sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.</p><p>Made in China 2025 is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China.</p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.</p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Although billed as foreign aid, in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.</p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its Digital Silk Road initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world's chess grandmasters. But the PRC's interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan, a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[6] Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China, in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[7]</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us.</p><p>As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer - allowing us to serve as the world's arsenal of democracy. China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's arsenal of dictatorship.</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.</p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.[8] The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers - including American companies - from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.</p><p>China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively creating their own competitors.[9]</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as APIs. As one Defense Health Agency official noted, [s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States], it could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.[10]</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a high-value-added-industry and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[11] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.</p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, [t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.[12]</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.</p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.[13] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence-even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.</p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the Ancient One, a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.[14] Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say [w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.[15]</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market-both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier.</p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood-and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, [e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.[16] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.</p><p>In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.[17] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China-the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives - efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.</p><p>As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a friendly face on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.</p><p>America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the guanxi - or system of influential social networks-necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the agents of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[18]</p><p>These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes, which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands.</p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength.</p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.</p><p>But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a stupid mistake.[19] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.</p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell - later Justice Powell - sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. [T]he time has come, he said, indeed, it is long overdue-for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.[20]</p><p>So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.</p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.[21] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule.</p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before.

The study found that the number of banking and payments institutions decreased by nearly 20 percent over a 12-year period  from 24,000 in 2005 to less than 19,300 in 2017. However, nearly one in six (17 percent) current institutions are what Accenture considers new entrants  i.e., companies entering the market after 2005. While few of these new players have raised alarm bells among traditional banks, the threat of reduced future revenue growth opportunities is real and growing.</p><p>Two new reports from Accenture quantify the level of disruption in the banking industry: Beyond North Star Gazing discusses how industry change is shaping the strategic priorities for banks, and Star Shifting: Rapid Evolution Required outlines what banks can do to take advantage of these changes to maintain customer relevance and ensure future revenue growth.</p><p>Most banks are struggling to find the right mix of investments in traditional and digital capabilities as they balance meeting the needs of digital customers with maintaining legacy systems that protect customer data, said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture and head of its global Banking practice. Banks cant simply digitally enable their business as usual and expect to be successful. So far, the conservative approach to digital investment has hindered banks ability to build new sources of growth, which is crucial to escaping the tightening squeeze of competition from digital attackers and deteriorating returns.</p><p>Industry disruption</p><p>Many incumbent banks continue to dismiss the threat of new entrants, claiming that (1) new entrants are not creating new innovations, but rather dressing up traditional banking products; (2) significant revenue is not moving to new entrants; and (3) new entrants are not generating profits. However, the reports analyzed where revenue is shifting to new entrants and identifies examples of true innovation happening around the world that can no longer be dismissed. Accenture predicts that the shift in revenue to new entrants will continue and will start to have a material impact on incumbent banks profits.</p><p>U.S.: Nineteen percent of financial institutions in the U.S. are new entrants and have captured 3.5 percent of total banking and payments revenues. Over the past dozen years, the number of financial institutions in the U.S. has decreased by nearly one-quarter, largely due to the financial crisis and subsequent regulatory hurdles imposed to obtain a banking license. These factors have made the U.S. a difficult market for new entrants and a stable environment for incumbents. More than half of new current accounts opened in the U.S. have been captured by three large banks that are making material investments in digital, while regional banks focus on cost reduction and struggle to grow their balance sheets.</p><p>Ten years after the financial crisis, the banking industry is experiencing a level of competitive intensity and disruption thats much greater than whats been seen before, said Julian Skan, a senior managing director at Accenture and global Banking lead, Accenture Strategy. With challenger banks and platform players reducing traditional banks competitiveness and the threat of a power shift looming, incumbent players can no longer rest on their laurels. Banks are mobilizing to take advantage of industry changes, leveraging digital technologies and ecosystem business models to cement their relevance with customers and regain revenue growth.</p><p>UK: With regulation increasing competition in the financial services industry and reducing the dominance of established banks, 63 percent of players in the UK are new entrants. This is eye-popping compared with other markets and the 17 percent global average. New entrants have captured 14 percent of total banking revenues, with the clear majority (12 percent) going to non-bank payments institutions. While they have only taken around 14 percent of revenues, the reports suggest that they are taking over one third of new revenue indicating a higher level of disruption in the future. The reports also suggest that incumbent banks will therefore likely start to see a significant impact on revenues as leading challenger banks are surpassing the 1 million customer threshold and 15 fintechs have been granted full banking licenses.</p><p>Canada: Investors have backed new entrants in Canada with the intention of disrupting the banking industry. While nearly half (47 percent) of banking and payments institutions are new entrants, they have captured less than 2 percent of total banking and payments revenue, making Canada one of the least disrupted major banking markets.</p><p>Europe: In Europe (including the UK), 20 percent of the banking and payments institutions are new entrants and have captured nearly 7 percent of total banking revenue  and one-third (33 percent) of all new revenue since 2005.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-128710662</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THM-P141-JDJN-602W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

Cadwalader attorneys say it remains to be seen whether the investigations will ripen into complaints and, if so, whether they will be rooted in antitrust or involve consumer protections with respect to data privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A law enforcement freight train is barreling headlong into Big Tech, which has become shorthand in antitrust circles for Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon. This is hardly unprecedented: in the 1990s, the Justice Department's sights were set on dismantling Microsoft, its tech boogeyman of the day. In a sign of how \"last century\" that case was, Microsoft is not even part of the current Big Tech conversation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This time, on Sept. 10, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) announced the formation of a bipartisan coalition of 50 attorneys general investigating Google's alleged market power in search and digital advertising as well as potential abuses of consumer privacy. On Sept. 6, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) announced a somewhat smaller but also bipartisan coalition that would be investigating whether Facebook \"may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising.\"</p><p>The investigations follow a trend of increased state activity into what the states may perceive as a void of antitrust enforcement at the federal level.</p><p>Historically, state attorneys general have followed the lead of the federal antitrust enforcement agencies, the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. But past state antitrust investigations were sometimes criticized for focusing on voter-sensitive issues, such as the effect of a merger on local employment, rather than on consumer welfare economics. Not so anymore. State antitrust enforcement today is generally focused on core antitrust violations even if pushing the boundaries of conventional theory.</p><p>No where is the new activism more evident than in the complaint by 10 Democratic state attorneys general (now expanded to a more bipartisan group) to block the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, a deal that later won the support of the DOJ and the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>Even prior to this month's blockbuster investigation announcements, the states have been inching toward greater engagement with Big Tech. For example, in June a coalition of 43 state attorneys general advised the FTC on consumer protection and digital platforms and proposed ideas for increased merger enforcement for companies in the technology sector.</p><p>History Repeats Itself</p><p>The establishment of a bipartisan coalition of states attorneys is likely to add pressure on the DOJ and FTC to take a deeper dive into antitrust violations in Big Tech. Enforcement actions of state attorneys general arguably helped spur past federal action. For example, in the 1990s, 20 state attorneys general helped build a case against Microsoft. The states joined the DOJ in suing the software company after rivals complained that Microsoft leveraged its monopoly to erect barriers to competitors. While the DOJ assumed the lead against Microsoft, the states were lurking in the shadows.</p><p>More recently, pressure from state focus on Big Tech may have contributed to the FTC's recent eye popping $5 billion settlement with Facebook, its recent $175 million settlement with Google's YouTube, and the DOJ's recent announcement that it was investigating the platforms of all four of the Big Tech firms.</p><p>Building the Antitrust Case</p><p>While the states undoubtedly have the authority to investigate Big Tech, it is far from certain that they will be able to build a record that will warrant relief under the antitrust laws. The states face several hurdles in their antitrust investigations. First, with respect to seeking possible divestitures of prior Facebook acquisitions, the states will have to develop evidence that Facebook has a significant share of a market in which competition was lessened by reason of an acquisition.</p><p>That may be a daunting task with respect to Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp given that Facebook itself is not an international calling/texting site. Similarly, Facebook's Instagram likely competes most closely with Snapchat and other photo sharing sites but probably less so with Facebook's social media platform. Indeed, proving an overall social media market in which Facebook arguably possesses market power would appear to be a big lift.</p><p>Second, possible claims that Facebook and/or Google possess market power in a market for digital advertising face their own challenges, among them serious market definition issues and the question of which one of Facebook or Google can be characterized as a monopolist. (Could there be two monopolists?)</p><p>Third, inquiries into Facebook and Google raise thorny questions about consumer harm. Both companies' signature servicesFacebook's social media platform and Google's search engineare free and readily available for anyone to use. We expect the investigations will most likely focus on the cost of digital advertising to advertisers rather than direct consumer harm and both companies will face inquiry into practices that may have foreclosed rivals from entering or remaining in their respective markets.</p><p>Privacy Is Not Antitrust</p><p>While both Texas' and New York's press releases speak in terms of antitrust, it is clear that the investigations will embrace theories of both antitrust and privacy. The distinction is important because while there is a long history of U.S. legal precedent about antitrust theories of, for example, monopolization (Sherman Act Section 2) and mergers leading to a loss of competition (Clayton Act Section 7), the United States lacks an overriding federal policy statute similar to the General Data Protection Regulation enacted in Europe in 2018.</p><p>For the moment, the default U.S. privacy statute may be the far-reaching California Consumer Privacy Act signed into law last year. That groundbreaking law mandates certain disclosure obligations, opt-out rights for California residents, statutory damages for victims of data theft and data security breaches.</p><p>Neither the Texas nor New York press releases identify any specific misuse of consumer data or data breach by either Facebook or Google. Moreover, in the absence of a national privacy standard, it would appear that the states may be left to develop a standard of privacy by consent decree.</p><p>However, the FTC's recent settlement with Facebook has come under widespread criticism because the conduct portion of its consent decree leaves the content of Facebook's remedial actions largely up to Facebook to determine at some future time by some future board-level privacy committee that currently does not exist. Indeed both the FTC's Facebook and YouTube settlements were the product of 3-2 votes with the two Democratic appointees dissenting in protest of what they believed were insufficient remedies.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the state attorneys general investigations into Big Tech will ripen into complaints and, if so, whether the complaints will be rooted in antitrust or whether the states will try to implement consumer protections with respect to data privacy.</p><p>It remains unclear what markets and what market problems the attorneys general would be investigating under an antitrust theory. The issues of damages and what consumer harms have taken place will also be major hurdles in any forthcoming enforcement actions taken by the states.</p><p>In the absence of statutory guidance from Congress with respect to consumer data privacy, attempts by state actors to address privacy practices in Big Tech on a case-by-case basis may become more common. So while it may be unclear where the states are headed, it is clear that the train has left the station.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The report says regulators should aim to close regulatory gaps between big techs and other financial institutions. BIS encouraged regulators to extend applicable existing banking regulation to big techs using the \"basic principle\" of \"same activity, same regulation.\"</p><p>However, in cases where big techs have \"wrought structural changes . . . outside the scope of existing financial regulations,\" BIS advocated for the creation of new rules. BIS stated that different firms may require different approaches, noting that facilitating the entry of big techs into financial services may in some cases be conducive to greater competition and, in other cases, to less.</p><p>The report considers areas where big techs may have long-term competitive advantages over traditional financial services firms. It also considers the entry of technology firms into a variety of financial service businesses, including payments, and consumer and small-business lending and insurance. Finally, a significant portion of the report is taken up by raising privacy concerns and other issues as to how data may be used or misused.</p><p>To navigate potential policy choices, BIS created a \"regulatory compass\" to help regulators. The compass is broken down by:</p><p> North, which encourages new entry;South, which restricts the entry of big techs;East, which endows customers with property rights over their data; andWest, which limits big techs' use of customer data.</p><p>Commentary / Steven Lofchie</p><p>To boil down this report to a single sentence: In a competitive battle between big tech and big finance, big tech is going to be the winner.</p><p>According to the report, big tech's superior access to data, superior usage of that data, greater size, larger customer base, and more diverse range of product offerings makes it the overwhelming long-term favorite in a competitive battle with traditional financial service firms. The report finds this both potentially good (lower costs to consumers as prices are brought down by more efficient competitors) and potentially bad (higher costs to consumers as competition is reduced or eliminated; loss of privacy as data is analyzed with increasing accuracy).</p><p>One of the more interesting aspects of the report is how little of its significant discussion is about traditional financial regulation. The first paragraph launches immediately into concerns with competition; i.e., the ability of technology firms to \"offer a range of services that exploit natural network effects.\" Unsurprisingly, another significant aspect of the report deals with privacy and data usage.</p><p>The conclusion of the report is, appropriately, non-prescriptive as to what regulators should do next given the complexity of the issues. The report is a good read.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.</p><p><br/> Mr Steven Lofchie<br/> Cadwalader, Wickersham ; Taft LLP<br/> One World Financial Center<br/>New York<br/>NY 10281<br/> UNITED STATES<br/> Tel: 2125046000<br/> Fax: 2125046666<br/>E-mail: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cwtinfo@cwt.com\">cwtinfo@cwt.com</email><br/> URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cadwalader.com\">www.cadwalader.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONDAQ-10822918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MONDAQ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHT-G3K1-JCF5-V12P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">149522</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mondaq Ltd.

The number of players exploded from a few dozen in 2000 to about 600 these days. </p><p><br/>  It was almost like a gold rush,   says John Bace, research vice president of Gartner Inc.in Stamford, Conn.   People saw e-discovery as a quick and easy way to make money. <br/>With data and lawsuits proliferating, there still is plenty of money to be made in electronic data discovery. Look no further than the exhibit hall at ABA Techshow 2009, where e-discovery vendors were prominent. <br/>Commercial spending in this young niche is expected to increase this year by 20 percent to $4.05 billion, according to consultant George J. Socha Jr., who co-founded the Electronic Discovery Reference Model, an industry consortium that sets guidelines and standards. <br/>But growth has slowed sharply from annual rates of more than 40 percent just a few years ago, according to Socha  s surveys. And it  s getting much harder to compete profitably in an industry that is coming of age during the worst economic downturn in decades. For one thing, clients no longer are willing to write open-ended checks for services that easily can exceed $1.75 million for an average case. <br/>  Growth has started to moderate and margins have started to decrease,   says Nick Baughan of investment banking firm Marks Baughan &amp; Co. in Cornshohocken, Pa., which advised such deals as Applied Discovery  s sale to LexisNexis. <br/>  There is real technology disruption,   he adds. Big tech companies continue developing tools to classify and store data in formats that permit more efficient archival and retrieval for litigation and regulatory review.   They can do it at a push of the button,   Baughan says. <br/>Gartner estimates that by the end of this year, one in four software vendors will be acquired, merge or exit the e-discovery business. Socha, founder of St. Paul, Minn.-based Socha Consulting, sees even more shrinkage over time; he estimates consolidation will reduce the number of service and software providers by about two-thirds to as few as 200. There will always be room for smaller service players, he says, but   the market truly cannot support this many vendors in the long haul. <br/>Players such as Autonomy, Iron Mountain and Symantec, to name only a few, have acquired smaller companies to build one-stop shops for e-discovery, from identifying data all the way through to pro\u00adcessing, review and presentation. Mean\u00adwhile, others are exiting the business. <br/>Earlier this year, SPI Global Solu\u00adtions substantially cut its e-discovery operation in Austin, Texas. In Feb\u00adruary, e-discovery pioneer Onsite3 simultaneously announced Chapter 11 bankruptcy and plans to be acquired by Integreon, a legal processing outsourcer based in Arlington, Va.<br/>Churn is constant. Competi\u00adtors who bought software and sys\u00adtems several years ago now are stuck with higher legacy costs than new entrants at a time when profit mar<br/>Ltd.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-1625157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WFW-HFW1-2SDX-22XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

Sherrod Brown (D-OH)  ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs  delivered the following opening statement at hearing entitled Examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Browns remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:</p><p>Thank you Chairman Crapo, and welcome to our witnesses.</p><p>At this committees hearing earlier this month, many of us of both parties voiced serious concerns about Facebooks plan to run its own currency out of a Swiss bank account.</p><p>And by and large, we mostly heard deflections and dodging. Its exactly what we mean when we say Facebook doesnt understand accountability.</p><p>Facebook has proven over and over, through scandal after scandal, that it cant be trusted.</p><p>But they dont care.</p><p>They move fast and break things  things like our political discourse, journalism, relationships, privacy. Now they want to break our currency and payment systems, hiding behind the phrase innovation.</p><p>They want to innovate Americans right out of their hard-earned paychecks.</p><p>Look around at what happens with big corporations say they want to innovate.</p><p>Before they blew up the economy in 2008, bankers were pitching an innovative new product called subprime mortgages.</p><p>Just like Facebook  which claims its new currency will help the unbanked and underbanked  these mortgages were supposed to help people who never had access to credit achieve the American dream of homeownership.</p><p>In reality, those mortgages ripped off millions of families who ended up losing their homes, they wrecked the economy, and they made the staggering inequality in this country even worse.</p><p>The only innovative thing about the financial crisis was how the banks managed to stick everyone else with the bill  not exactly the kind of innovation we were hoping for.</p><p>So I am all for innovation  especially if that innovation delivers on its promises of improving peoples lives. But big tech companies and WallStreet banks are hiding behind innovation as an excuse to take over important public services that we all benefit from, and should all have a say in.</p><p>There are some things  like our currency, our payments system, and the protection of our savings accounts  that everyone in the country has a stake in. We should not be handing those kinds of public resources over to wealthy special interests, so they can squeeze more profits out of ordinary Americans.</p><p>Think about how hard it is to get quality service from Comcast, or about how much of your personal data was leaked by Equifax, or how your privacy was invaded by Facebook. And, we just learned in the last 24 hours, Capital One. Whos next? We dont know.</p><p>So we should be a little suspicious when someone tells us that only big corporations can be trusted to provide critical public services.</p><p>I recently moved into a new office  it was John Glenns office when he served Ohio in the Senate. I moved there because he and Annie are longtime friends. Weve known each other for 30 years. John Glenn spoke at my Eagle Scout dinner in Mansfield, Ohio 50 years ago. But I moved into that office primarily because he was an innovator  he was the first American to orbit the Earth as part of the Mercury Project, which would be followed by the Gemini and Apollo Missions that would eventually put Americans on the moon. Many of us joined in the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of Apollo 11 just this month.</p><p>None of the astronauts did it alone  it took the hard work of thousands of innovating scientists and engineers, people like famed mathematician Katherine Johnson or immigrants like engineer Miguel Hernandez. These Americans didnt do it for the profits. They did it to serve their country, and their successes were shared by every American who saw U-S-A emblazoned on the side of Apollo 11.</p><p>Its a reminder that some infrastructure works better as a public good, and we shouldnt let Big Banks or Big Tech get their hands on it.</p><p>The Federal Reserve and other watchdogs need to continue to be leaders in banking innovation.</p><p>And if we dont move quickly to improve important infrastructure  not just roads and bridges, and highways and water sewer systems, but our payments systems, too. If we dont move quickly to improve it, well end up with big corporations that have broken our trust again and again and again, and frankly I dont think that makes any sense.</p><p>I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about which of these technologies might actually help regular Americans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-150576863</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPM-B6T1-F11P-X2BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

Wien, Vice Chairman together with Joe Zidle, Chief Investment Strategist in the Private Wealth Solutions group at Blackstone, today issued their list of Ten Surprises for 2020. This is the 35th year Byron has given his views on a number of economic, financial market and political surprises for the coming year. Byron defines a surprise as an event that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place but which Byron believes is probable, having a better than 50% likelihood of happening. Byron started the tradition in 1986 when he was the Chief U.S. Investment Strategist at Morgan Stanley. Byron joined Blackstone in September 2009 as a senior advisor to both the firm and its clients in analyzing economic, political, market and social trends. In 2018, Joe Zidle joined Byron Wien in the development of the Ten Surprises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Byron and Joes Ten Surprises for 2020 are as follows:</p><p>1. The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided. Federal Reserve Chair Powell lowers the Fed funds rate to 1%. Without a comprehensive trade deal in hand, President Trump exercises every executive authority he has to stimulate growth and ward off recession. He cuts payroll taxes to put more money in the hands of consumers.</p><p>2. Inequality and climate change become important election themes, but centrist ideas prevail. The House of Representatives sends articles of impeachment to the Senate, but Donald Trump is not convicted or removed from office. Enough information is revealed in the proceedings to cause some of his supporters, as well as many independents, to throw their support to liberal candidates in 2020 state races. The Democrats take the Senate in November.</p><p>3. There is no comprehensive Phase Two trade deal that limits Chinas ability to acquire intellectual property.  National interests result in the balkanization of technology. The development of separate standards for 5G and other tech hardware proves to be bad news for the future of world economies. The move toward decoupling gains traction in negotiations with China.  US economic co-dependence with China erodes. Both China and the US keep their hands off Hong Kong and let the protest settle down by itself.</p><p>4. The prospect of a self-driving car is pushed further into the future.  A series of accidents with experimental vehicles causes a major manufacturer or technology company to issue a statement that it is no longer developing self-driving technology.</p><p>5. Emboldened by the pain of economic sanctions, Iran takes advantage of Americas unwillingness to intervene and steps up acts of hostility against Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Strait of Hormuz is closed and the price of oil (West Texas Intermediate) soars to over $70/barrel.</p><p>6. Even though some observers believe valuations are stretched, a surge in investor enthusiasm pushes the Standard &amp; Poors 500 above 3500 at some point during the year. Earnings increase only 5%, and S&amp;P 500 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly.  Volatility increases and there are several market corrections greater than 5% throughout the year.</p><p>7. Big tech companies face growing political scrutiny and social blowback. Once the market leaders, certain FAANG stocks underperform and the equal-weighted S&amp;P 500 outperforms. A proposal to break up the largest social media platforms and increase regulation and government oversight gains popularity.  This has greater success than prior government efforts against Apple, Microsoft and IBM, because it has widespread support from the American people.  A millennial in New York City puts a phone down and makes eye contact with another human and finds it non-threatening and refreshing.</p><p>8. Having secured a workable Brexit deal, the United Kingdom turns out to be the winner in its divorce from the European Union. The equity market rises and the pound rallies. The UK benefits from a long transition period, and growth exceeds 2% as foreign direct investment resumes now that the outlook is clarified. The EU economy remains soft, and European markets other than the UK underperform the US and Asia.</p><p>9. The bond bubble starts to leak, but negative rates continue abroad. Even though the US economy is slowing, the 10-year Treasury yield approaches 2.5% and the yield curve steepens. Japan and China pull away from the Treasury auctions. Rather than economic fundamentals or inflation, supply and demand drive yields higher.</p><p>10. The problems with Boeings 737 Max are fixed and deliveries begin.  The plane becomes a mainstay around the world, enabling airlines to operate more efficiently and increase profits. The stocks become market leaders.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-164062523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXV-FRM1-F11P-X0R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

What do voters in the US' most populous state want out of their Democratic nominee?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as you would expect at this time of year, the sun is shining and the wind is blowing through the Mission District in east-central San Francisco. A historically Latino neighborhood, the area has become a poster child for gentrification: Today, this is where you'll find hipsters, yoga studios and expensive boutiques alongside traditional taquerias and community art and cultural institutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Liliana and her friend Carlos have set up shop just around the corner from an expensive Mexican restaurant. Their empanadas come straight from a tupperware container for the price of $3 (2.70). When asked about politics, Liliana was unequivocal: \"We need change\" - but as a Mexican citizen, she is not allowed to vote.</p><p>Liliana also admits she's not familiar with any of the candidates. Her daughter has US citizenship but \"when we get to spend time together, we just want to enjoy it and not think about politics.\"</p><p>California's new role</p><p>In the past, California held its primary elections in June, towards the end of a months-long Democratic primary race. That late in the game, the rest of the country had already made their decisions, leaving California to essentially rubber-stamp one of a few candidates. In 2017, though, that changed when the state moved its primary elections up to March. California, the most populous state in the US, will now play a key role in deciding who will wind up as the Democratic nominee.</p><p>A third of the total delegates are up for grabs on one day, and 415 in California alone, the highest number of all the states. A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to secure the nomination in July. The votes on Super Tuesday will decide over 1,357 out of the total 3,979 delegates. Primary elections this Tuesday are also being held in Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Maine, Vermont, American Samoa. Democrats abroad are also voting.</p><p>Californians are still getting used to their new role, said JoAnne Williams, who lives in the Mission District.

What do voters in the US' most populous state want out of their Democratic nominee?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as you would expect at this time of year, the sun is shining and the wind is blowing through the Mission District in east-central San Francisco. A historically Latino neighborhood, the area has become a poster child for gentrification: Today, this is where you'll find hipsters, yoga studios and expensive boutiques alongside traditional taquerias and community art and cultural institutions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Liliana and her friend Carlos have set up shop just around the corner from an expensive Mexican restaurant. Their empanadas come straight from a tupperware container for the price of $3 (2.70). When asked about politics, Liliana was unequivocal: \"We need change\" - but as a Mexican citizen, she is not allowed to vote.</p><p>Liliana also admits she's not familiar with any of the candidates. Her daughter has US citizenship but \"when we get to spend time together, we just want to enjoy it and not think about politics.\"</p><p>California's new role</p><p>In the past, California held its primary elections in June, towards the end of a months-long Democratic primary race. That late in the game, the rest of the country had already made their decisions, leaving California to essentially rubber-stamp one of a few candidates. In 2017, though, that changed when the state moved its primary elections up to March. California, the most populous state in the US, will now play a key role in deciding who will wind up as the Democratic nominee.</p><p>A third of the total delegates are up for grabs on one day, and 415 in California alone, the highest number of all the states. A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to secure the nomination in July. The votes on Super Tuesday will decide over 1,357 out of the total 3,979 delegates. Primary elections this Tuesday are also being held in Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Maine, Vermont, American Samoa. Democrats abroad are also voting.</p><p>Californians are still getting used to their new role, said JoAnne Williams, who lives in the Mission District. After moving here from Harlem, New York, she said she was surprised by the lack of interest and civic engagement in San Francisco. \"It's a completely different culture, a completely different vibe, and it seems like folks are so in a bubble. I actually just had an internal debate with myself about whether to add a calendar invite for my team to at least make sure that everyone on my team was aware that we had a primary election on Tuesday.\"</p><p>Williams works in the finance department of one of the big tech companies. She is planning on voting for Elizabeth Warren, she said. Among other things, Williams said she is impressed with Warren's track record to protect consumers from big banks.</p><p>California is 'feeling the Bern'</p><p>Warren is in third place and has earned only eight delegates so far. The Massachusetts senator is far behind front-runner Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, with 45 delegates, and Joe Biden, former vice president, with 15 delegates. Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist, is leading after early contests. </p><p>Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, is only now officially entering the race. He could possibly steal a good number of votes from Sanders and Biden. Tulsi Gabbard, the congresswoman from Hawaii, will likely not earn any delegates, since candidates need more than 15% of votes to be considered.</p><p>The state of California leans Democratic, but outside of the liberal cities, there are plenty of conservatives. Orange County and the Central Valley are home to a high number of lower-middle and working-class Americans. Those who are registered as Democrats and are voting in the primary will most likely stick to the conservative candidates and could give Bloomberg - who is known to have supported plenty of Republicans in the past - a boost. </p><p>Who can beat Trump?</p><p>Bloomberg is definitely Harrison Tucker's first choice.

Our top  stories, promise is kept.  President Trump eking a trade deal with Canada  and Mexico that does away with the job killing NAFTA replacing it with an  agreement that is fair and reciprocal, putting America first. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Once approved by Congress,  this new deal will be the most modern, up-to-date and balanced trade  agreement in the history of our country.  With the most advanced  protections for workers ever developed.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We'll take up the economic significance of President Trump's  historic agreement with the director of the White House Trade Counsel,  Peter Navarro.  Also the FBI's 7th, seven, that's seven, investigations of  Judge Brett Kavanaugh could conclude as early as tomorrow.  Radical Dimm  obstructionists are already criticizing the investigation, proving they  have no regard for either the truth, their pledges, and are only interested  in political results.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless  and outrageous tactics of the Democrat Party.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Republican Strategist Ed Rollins, New York Post Columnist, Michael  Goodwin here tonight to discuss the Supreme Court confirmation battle.  And  it is a battle to the death, it seems.  NFL ratings taking another hit as  Roger Goodell and the owners continue to do little in some cases absolutely  nothing to address the remaining anthem controversy that has fans  abandoning the sport in droves.</p><p>Retired player Burgess Owens joins us tonight to talk about what if  anything can be done to turn the NFL round and to restore proper respect  and regard for the very people who make it all possible, American fans.  We  begin with breaking news tonight.  The Senate Majority Leader, Senator  Mitch McConnell setting a time for the Senate to vote on Judge Brett  Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  The time for endless  delay and obstruction has come to a close.  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is  out of committee, we're considering it here on the floor and Mr. President  will be voting this week.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Senator McConnell's commitment to the President comes as we learn  that the FBI could, could wrap up its investigation into allegations  against Judge Kavanaugh by tomorrow.  Our other top stories, well, we'll  lead off with a big one.  President Trump tearing up NAFTA as promised,  announcing a historic trade deal with Canada and Mexico finally putting  America first.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of  fairness and reciprocity.  To me it is the most important word in trade  because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations, all over the  world and we're changing that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  By the way, the President, I want to point this out very quickly,  he's right about reciprocity as is often the case.  The President is the  first president in three decades to talk about reciprocity in a trade deal  with the United States.  It's extraordinary.  The President winning a major  concession with Canada, now easing restrictions on its dairy market,  allowing American farmers to export about half a billion dollars worth of  dairy products for the first time.</p><p>The agreement boosting the auto industry as well.  Requirements for 75  percent of auto content to be made in North America, up from 62 percent and  Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum remaining in place, a strategy he  says led to today's new continental trade agreement.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs,  that includes Congress, so please don't charge tariffs, without tariffs you  wouldn't be -- we wouldn't be standing here.  And we're totally prepared to  do that, if they don't negotiate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President's tough tactics on trade leading to a deal last week  with South Korea.  The European Union has come to the negotiating table.   As well, the United States and Japan have begun trade talks.  And India is  now also seeking a deal.  President Trump today saying China wants to talk,  \"very badly\", but the President also says it's too soon.  The Trump  administration just last week imposed tariffs on $200 billion of exports  from China to the United States.</p><p>Our first guest tonight with the president during the Rose Garden trade  announcement and joining us is Peter Navarro, assistant to the president,  director of Trade and Industrial Policy, the director of the White House  Trade Council.  Good to have you with us, Peter.  Let's turn first of all  first of all -- well, first of all, let's say congratulations to you, to  the Trumo White House, and to the President.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  One fine day  in America, one fine day in North America with this deal.  I always -- it  was just precious being on the stage with the President.  You know, he  keeps saying, are you going to get tired of winning?   It's been a great 10  days, I mean, deals with Japan, deals with South Korea.  </p><p>DOBBS:  -- almost two years -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAVARRO:  It's amazing.  This president is putting down a record that is  the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern  history.  It's just amazing.  We don't hear about it on the press.  But  this record is amazing.  The economy is amazing.  And the funny thing, Lou,  is that he always gets criticized for being too tough.  Don't do this,  don't try that.  And sure enough it works.  And it work like charm today  and it's a good deal for both Canada and Mexico.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, I got to say to you, I don't think the president is being  criticized that much anymore.  I think he's certainly being criticized, you  know, that part of the left, the national left-wing media, they're going to  keep the nonsense up, they don't understand economics.  They don't  understand politics, history or the national interests.  The President  schools them each day.  At some point you would think they would learn.</p><p>But as you watch the press today, you know, there's a group that it's not  worth the time.  You know, I look at this and I say this is terrific and  for Mexico and Canada, does want to remain in something he calls the USMCA,  the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement instead of NAFTA.  You know, I  love that because it doesn't imply something that it's not.  It's a trade  agreement, straightforward, simple, for everybody to understand.</p><p>It doesn't imply a North American Free Trade Agreement because it's not.   It is a reciprocal balanced trade agreement.  And secondly it doesn't imply  a North American Union, harmonization of borders and a coming together of  three nations into one massive, you know, central command, of course, led  by the elites.  So, I'm very -- I'm thrilled with what the President has  accomplished here.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  And really, it hits three points in the triangle.  For me, having  a deal that's going to make this hemisphere the regional manufacturing base  for the world, it's going to bring back our supply chain through tough  regional content rules and labor rules, that's number one.  We've got  modernization of the agreement so bring things in like digital trade and  biologics which didn't exist in 1994.</p><p>And farmers made out very, very well today.  Not just dairy, chicken, eggs,  other things.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, the Chinese who have been trying to run their propaganda  through the newspapers in the Midwest and, you know, various outlets will  be pleased to hear that.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, there was some pretty strong signals in the agreement as  well.  There's a strong provision there on currency and currency  manipulation.  And last week, Lou, this went unnoticed like so much of what  President Trump does.  There was an amazing statement -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, it doesn't go unnoticed here, Peter.  I don't know who you  are talking to, but this audience knows what he's doing.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Absolutely, Lou.  You've been on this for 20 years, and these  days -- </p><p>DOBBS:  So what is it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  What is it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>NAVARRO:  So last week Japan, Europe and the United States led by the  Ambassador Lighthizer issued a joint statement basically condemning the  practices of China with regard to forced technology transfer and these huge  nonmarket subsidies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  I think that's Great, peter, but I got to be really honest with  you.  I'm ready for the statement that they're not going to permit the  theft of intellectual property from this country ever again.  And that as  they continue intellectual property theft, there will be consequences.   We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars as you know.  I don't frankly  give a darn about a collegial multi-state agreement.</p><p>I want this country to stand up and insist that it not happen further.  I  don't care if it's part of an agreement.  The hell with the agreement.   It's our property.  It ought to stop.  It ought to stop now.  OK?</p><p>NAVARRO:  I will give you an amen to that, Lou.  And the President's  already imposed $250 billion worth of tariffs on China for stealing our  stuff.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I think that's wonderful.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  But this statement last week is important because it wasn't -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  I appreciate it, Peter.  We're out of time.  I do.  I'm thrilled  that the President has succeeded in this agreement.  This is a wonderful  achievement for the administration, for this presidency.  And for the  director of the trade council.  Congratulations, Peter.  Thanks so much and  --</p><p>NAVARRO:  Thank so much, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- we -- nobody watching you on this broadcast is tired of winning  at all.   Thanks.  Up next, the shameless national left-wing media using today's  historic trade deal announcement to berate President Trump about Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In a tweet this weekend, Mr. President, you said that  it's incorrect to say you are limiting the scope of the FBI investigation.  </p><p>TRUMP:  What does that have to do with trade?  I don't mind answering the  question, but, you know, I would like to do the trade question.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It has to do with the other headline in the news  which is the Kavanaugh nomination.  </p><p>TRUMP:  No.  But -- I know.  But how about talking about trade and then  we'll go to that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do have a question on the Kavanaugh thing when you  get back to it if you take that.  You will take that now?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No, no.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Well, the question --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You said the FBI should interview whoever they  believe is appropriate.  Does that include Julie Swetnick, the third  accuser?  And can you promise to release the full findings -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  Give me your question, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- after they finish the report, Mr. President?</p><p>TRUMP:  Give me a question, please.  Give her the mic, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you saying your White House has put no  limitations on -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  No.  My White House is doing whatever the Senators want.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  No, no.  You don't -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Who they should interview?  </p><p>TRUMP:  You don't understand what I'm saying.  You do understand, you just  don't want to report it that way.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President, you know, you wouldn't think there would be that  many people who call themselves journalists, professionals, who don't  understand about manners and respect for the President and the White House.   We'll take that up with Ed Rollins and Michael Goodwin.  Should the  President be putting up with this nonsense?  That's also part of the  message as we continue in just one moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A Senior Republican Senate source tells Fox News that the FBI's  investigation into Judge Kavanaugh could wrap up as early as tomorrow.   This after the President was asked at least -- are you ready?  -- 11  questions about the Kavanaugh investigation and this at a time when the  President has -- was seeking some kind of order dealing first with trade  and then -- and I have to say, there is no recognizable standard of conduct  in the White House for the President of the United States.  This is  outrageous.</p><p>And I'm -- and I'm saying this as a journalist.  I am just outraged.  The  President stated once again he backs the investigation, but he wants it  done according to the terms requested by the Senate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation, whatever that  means according to the Senators and the Republicans and the Republican  majority.  I want them to do that.  I want it to be comprehensive.  I  actually think it is a good thing for Judge Kavanaugh.  I think it's  actually a good thing, not a bad thing.  I think it's a good thing.  Now,  with that being said, I'd like it to go quickly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President's position is the same as when he called for it last  week.  But already the radical Dems are trying to -- well, they want to  change the direction.  They've made an agreement.  They've torn that one  up.  And now they want a new one, and they want to tell everybody what the  FBI should be looking into.  You know, all of the subjects and issues and  events that they didn't question Judge Kavanaugh about when they had the  opportunity.</p><p>And they didn't when they had the opportunity to do the same with Dr. Ford.   We wouldn't be in this position, had it not been for the tortured confused  soul of the two-face Senator from Arizona, Snowflake, Arizona, by the way,  Jeff Flake who said he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh without a  supplemental FBI investigation.  Flake admitting that he only called for  the investigation because of his failed Senatorial career.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could you have done this if you were running for  reelection?  </p><p>REP. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  No, not a chance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not a chance.</p><p>FLAKE:  No.  No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because politics has become too sharp?  Too partisan?  </p><p>FLAKE:  Yes.  There's no value to reaching across the aisle.  There's no  currency for that anymore.  There's no incentive.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Wait a minute.  All the Democratic Senators on that committee were  telling everybody this isn't a partisan moment.  Yet Senator Flake has  discovered something.  It is a partisan moment, a bitterly hostile vicious  partisan moment.  In fact, despite Flake's call for an investigation,  despite the radical Dems pushing for more and more and more, nothing will  ever be good enough for the left.</p><p>New York Congressman Nadler talk about the left.  He made it very clear no  matter what the FBI finds, Congressional Dems will not be satisfied.  They  will not stop their smear campaign against Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D), NEW YORK:  This has got to be thoroughly  investigated.  I hope the Senate will do so.  If he is on the Supreme  Court, and the Senate hasn't investigated, then I -- then the House will  have to. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't he eloquent?  The House will have to.  With only 36 days to  go, until the midterms, statements like Nadler's make it clear what the  radical left is and that the radical left will stop at nothing to undermine  President Trump's agenda and destroy a great American jurist and a great  American.  Well, joining us tonight, top strategist for Great America PAC,  former Reagan White House political director, Fox News Political Analyst,  Ed Rollins.</p><p>New York Post Columnist, Fox Business Contributor, Michael Goodwin.  Thank  you both for being here.  I have to ask you, watching those people in the  White House Press Corps, ignorantly behave as they have, what in the world  is going to turn that around because that is a way in which the national  left-wing media is confusing the President's message and they are forcing  the President to correct their ill-mannered disrespect.  </p><p>MICHAEL GOODWIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  It is remarkable to watch it  time and again.  I mean, it's not just the questions they ask, but the  argumentative tone.  They interrupt the President.  Never saw that before.   But only this president.  The good news is they don't seem to matter.  I  mean, his success is not dependent on their recognition of it.  I think the  people -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't it time for somebody in that communications department?  I  mean somebody, whoever it may be, to start laying down some basic protocols  and etiquette and just a baseline for just decent behavior? </p><p>GOODWIN:  I think they have tried.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They have tried?  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes, yes.  I mean, they have cut CNN out of certain meetings and  things like that.  The problem is, the media itself has now become so  radicalized that it used to be that the press corps would sort of police  its own behavior.  Now it is just we're all -- we're all together against  him, that's the mood.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Do you -- would you like one of these networks to try to perform,  Ed?  Without the President?  I mean, if the President of the United States  tells the communications people, anyone who interrupts me again, this has  got to be, you know, it's got to end somewhere.  CNN would -- could their  ratings go lower?  I can guarantee you they can go lower.  You stop Jim  Acosta from behaving as he does, acting out?  </p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, the bottom line he doesn't have to  deal with it that way.  You know, President Obama to his credit basically  always had four or five people he hand-picked he was going to call on.  He  didn't call on anybody else.  He didn't have to go out to this PAC like  this, we have a very important decision or announcement to make.</p><p>DOBBS:  So what's going on?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think -- I think the White House communications operation is  failing and our old friend Bill Shine he's got all of it.  Put a choke  collar on some of these people.  And the President stand up there and  perform.  </p><p>DOBBS:  I have never known Bill Shine to be a reticent force at an  organization.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he needs -- he needs to be.  He's got the job now and he  needs to basically create some discipline and not leave the President out  there vulnerable to this PAC.  The bottom line is he needs to stand out  there and make the announcements and not have the press there answering  questions.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.  I think that's one way around it.  You don't need to have a  press conference.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, the President enjoys it because he basically dribbles their  little -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROLLINS:  He loves to banter and punts back.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  -- the White House lawn.  But it's -- first of all, but this is  becoming extraordinary in the disrespect towards the President.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Absolutely, it is.</p><p>DOBBS:  They can't -- they can't compete with him intellectually.  They  have no knowledge base to deal with.  They have no idea what in many  instances there is no -- there is just no comparison with the president.   Simply put, if they all talked at once, it still wouldn't be a fair fight.   But at the same time, they are -- you know, it's a disturbance in the  atmosphere.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Who is going to control the agenda?  Are they going to talk about  what he -- they want to talk about what he -- they want to talk about even  what the President wants to talk about and the accomplishments that he's  made including today with this enormous treaty that no one thought he could  pull it off and he's pulled it off.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Oh, it's extraordinary.  Very quickly.  Let's go to a number of  things.  Bernie Sanders quote -- let's -- I would request you inform the  FBI you will not consider their work complete until blah, blah, blah, the  same nonsense from Mazie Hirono, the Senator from Hawaii, you know, the  bull flies every -- in every direction from these people.  Why is anyone --  you know, to his credit, Senator McConnell says the vote comes this week.   Good luck.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes, yes, yes.  And Grassley had a wonderful letter back at  Sanders who -- look, I think the problem -- the Democrats revealed their  hand too early and they made it clear.  So now they have no credibility.   When they have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Too early.  Let's remind everybody that Chuck Schumer, the senior  Senator from New York, you know, told everybody, declared he was going to  stop -- he would destroy this guy, the day his name was announced.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Twenty-three minutes after, I believe.  </p><p>DOBBS:  The day that his name was announced by the President for this post.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  If we learn the lesson on the value of these elections, if the  House goes Democrat, Jerry Nadler will be chairman of the Oversight  Committee.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, that's frightening.  Should be frankly, it's frightening  that he's there.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>DOBBS:  And Maxine Waters will be chairman of the financial banking  institutions.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that will be a move for Jamie Dimon.  He will have some fun  then, huh?</p><p>ROLLINS:  So, just -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, it's -- we're going to show everyone an ad right now, very  quickly, we would like to run the commercial that Ed's PAC, the Great  America PAC has just put out defending Judge Kavanaugh.  Let's roll that,  if we could, please.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SCHUMER:  Judge Kavanaugh, I will oppose him with everything I've got.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Democrats admitted they would do anything to stop  Judge Kavanaugh from the start.  Instead of protecting Dr. Ford, they use  her, leaking her story, when she asked to be anonymous.  Democrats don't  care about protecting women and they never have.  Democrats have just one  goal, expanding their power.  We must confirm Judge Kavanaugh and reject  the Democrat power grab.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Ed, I think you have put out a very powerful product there.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  It is a truthful ad.</p><p>DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All about power.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Michael, you get the last word.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  I was going to say to Ed, how do you really feel? </p><p>ROLLINS:  Feel as strongly as Schumer does on the other side.  This is a  great man.  He should be on this court.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Couldn't agree more.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Have we -- have we got unanimity here?  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Absolutely.  </p><p>DOBBS:  All right.  Let me bring the gavel down.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you, gentlemen, appreciate it.  Be sure to vote in our poll  tonight.  Now that the President has secured the fair reciprocal trade deal  with Canada and Mexico, economic growth is soaring.  Stocks are near record  highs.  So what happens now?  Do you think a single bit of naysaying on the  part of left-wing savants who work for the fake news will admit they were  completely wrong now and President Trump absolutely right?</p><p>Wow, I can't wait to hear from you on this one.  I was -- I was just  thinking of a couple of New York Times economics writers, Nobel Laureate  one of them.  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  Coming up next, a gift  to the Republican Party, Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama are championing  the Dems push to the radical left.  More on these -- well, these hungry  campaigners.  We will let you decide what they are hungry for.</p><p>Washington Times Columnist Tammy Bruce joins me here next.  We're coming  right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump talking tonight at a rally in Johnson City,  Tennessee where he is supporting a senator -- the Congresswoman Marsha  Blackburn who wants to be the senator from Tennessee.  Touting his new  trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And just today we made  history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job- killing disaster known as NAFTA, with a brand new U.S.-Mexico Canada.  We  added Canada, worked out great, trade agreement.  And we're calling it  USMCA, no more NAFTA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Straight forward.  Former President Barack Obama putting his name  behind -- are you ready?  260 radical Dems in the midterms.  His extensive  list includes self-described socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New  York, Andrew Gillum in Florida.  A reminder in his eight years as  President, Obama presided over the Democratic Party loss of 63 seats in the  House, 10 in the Senate, as well as the loss of 12 governorships losing  more than a thousand, thousand Democratic --Democrats in his mere eight  years in office.  </p><p>And if you needed more proof of just how desperate the Dems are, they're  providing it, rolling out failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now  to push their radical agenda.  Those are cheers you hear from Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Imagine being able to hold  this administration accountable and actually make progress when it comes to  affordable health care, the rights of immigrants and refugees.  The urgent  challenge of climate change and yes, I could go on and on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  As she so often does.  As promised it would be a blessing for the  Republican Party as it seems that Dems still don't get why President Trump  is in office and not Hillary Clinton. </p><p>Well, joining us now Tammy Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business  contributor.  Great to have you with us Tammy.</p><p>First, to listen to Obama, to listen to Clinton, there have to be  Democratic candidates all over the country just quivering with fear at the  impact.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, Hillary it sounds like  she's running to be President of the European Union, certainly not this  country, right?</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  I look, we made a statement 2016 and both Barack Obama and Hillary  Clinton could not convince the American people when we had no idea how  extraordinary Donald Trump really would be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Around nefarious the Democrats were.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, exactly.  Now, that we've learned, we've got these  investigations, we found out exact -- well, I mean, it's really the tip of  the iceberg what we've learned about them.  But the fact is, Barack Obama  destroyed the Democratic Party.  That's why he has these very strange  individuals that he is supporting.  It's still though all about him, he's  desperate to not be seen as a failure and so is Hillary Clinton.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's too far too late.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, this is both of their problems.  They never viewed the  country as the priority.</p><p>DOBBS:  So, all we have to do is give up a country.  A constitutional  republic --</p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- leave it in ashes so that --</p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- we can pretend we care about their legacies, my God.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, they never cared about, they still don't think about the  average American --</p><p>DOBBS:  No, they care about -- remember --</p><p>BRUCE:  That is Donald Trump's strength.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They've demonstrated again in the Judiciary Committee how much they  care about women.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, they said on a woman's legitimate concerns and pain they  said for six weeks, they acknowledge, they leaked it to the press despite  her request for confidentiality.  And you can't even hear a whisper in the  left-wing media about holding them accountable.  Dianne Feinstein, Cory  Booker the list goes on.</p><p>BRUCE:  Her own lawyers who were referred to her by Senator Feinstein.  We  now believe of course mislead Dr. Ford about what her options would be when  it came to talking with the committee that they would go to California.   She clearly testified that she was unaware of that offer effectively.  That  is the kind of thing that needs to be investigated and I believe that that  is what we're going to be doing now, when it comes to how this woman was  misled.</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, we're becoming an investigative country, aren't we?  The  American people are going to have to take a look at what's in full view and  make a determination.  The radical element of this party is this, they've  taken over the Democratic Party, their conduct.  I mean, Chuck Schumer was  in a bit shaded nuanced.</p><p>BRUCE:  Not at all.</p><p>DOBBS:  He said point-blank he was going to destroy the president's nominee  if he could and that's what they have tried to do.</p><p>BRUCE:  And they want to eliminate due process, they want you to be guilty  and trying to prove yourself innocent.  I said in a column months ago that  the Democratic Party is really now Antifa.  It is -- it is that radical  element that has moved forward looking to destroy things for revenge with  no plan for the future and no desire to govern.</p><p>DOBBS:  You think -- do you think Kavanaugh gets the confirmation?</p><p>BRUCE:  You know, it depends on what happens this week.  It's a shame we've  given them another week, but I think so, yes.  I think we'll have it.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Great to see you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next President Trump's patriotism stands tall over the NFL.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>DOBBS:  Despite a marquee matchup last night between the Baltimore Ravens  and Pittsburgh Steelers ratings for Sunday Night Football fell 10 percent  from the previous week.  The NFL's national game on CBS between the Saints  and Giants also the lowest rated national game of this young NFL season</p><p>Joining us tonight, former NFL player for the New York Jets and the Oakland  Raiders Burgess Owens, author of the new book Why I Stand: From Freedom to  the Killing Fields of Socialism.  Burgess, great to have you with us.   Thanks so much.</p><p>BURGESS OWENS, AUTHOR, WHY I STAND:  Ho you doing, Lou?  Looking forward to  chatting with you my friend.</p><p>DOBBS:  And to you -- you know, it's just great to have you here.  I just  want to turn first to that game last night, these ratings for the NFL, no  one should start organizing a benefit for the NFL.  But my goodness, this  is just getting worse and worse.</p><p>OWENS:  Yes, well first of all, I didn't see the game.  I haven't really  seen a game for two years.  So, well, it comes down to it Lou, we have to  understand that this is -- this is on purpose.  We have an organization who  in the past was very patriotic.  We all remember the Al Davis days and Pete  Rozelle, we're now dealing with globalists.  </p><p>Then, there's two types by the way, there's the Republican and Democratic  globalist who care more about profits and patriotism and then, there's the  worst of the two as a leftist globalist who care about the socialist agenda  over patriotism.</p><p>We have an organization, it cares more about their international reach than  it care about the American brand and America -- and the American -- the NFL  fan.  These guys have already put in place 80 different countries, they  wanted they put into 200 like the Soccer League has.  It's all about T.V.  revenue.  They could care less about how full these stadiums are.  They get  their money and they share profits based on that T.V. revenue.  If they can  do in a global fashion, they'll be just like the soccer league with 200  countries tie-in no brand, no country brand but a global brand.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>OWENS:  And that's what their answer in the process of doing as they demean  our flag, demeaning our culture.  So, they will be accepted another place  like China and France and the other countries that are not so pro-American.</p><p>DOBBS:  As you -- as you put it and I have heard no one -- I mean, thank  you for that insight because frankly I hadn't considered that.  And I  suspect that lots of folks are just for the first time kind of wrapping  their heads around globalism its impact on the NFL.  And of course, that's  cumbersome.  I mean, we've seen it with this most recent movie about Neil  Armstrong and his -- you know, walking for the first time on the face of  the Moon.</p><p>OWENS:  Grab the flag.</p><p>DOBBS:  A great patriotic American, a great -- you, he was just an amazing  pilot, decorated.  He was just an amazing fellow.  And the American flag is  in front and center.  </p><p>And the -- and the reality is, you're right, the American flag becomes an  avatar for something that could maybe depress their global -- their global  expansion at the NFL.</p><p>OWENS:  Well, Lou, follow the money.  We have a commissioner who just  signed a contract with $40 million per year.  Only 10 percent of that for  me is guaranteed, the other 90 percent is based on his sentence.  Now,  understand, they've been dropping 20 percent, 13 percent of (INAUDIBLE)  last year, last couple years.  </p><p>But yet, then it capped -- or get capped out by the way 13 billion in the  United States.  We have to project in 27 billion in the next nine years  globally.</p><p>So, no, they don't care about America, they don't care about the American  fan who put them in place they are right now.  They're globalists and  globalist care more about their pocketbooks and their profits and the best  thing we can do is obviously not showing up is good thing but we need to  stop supporting their sponsors.  T.V. revenue is what gets into where they  are and now they share that equally, if we can we can hit them hard enough,  so that we hit them before they get their global things in place.  And  maybe they'll fire this commissioner and get somebody who cares about our  country about it -- about this brand and not trying to destroy.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that is a lot to consider.  Let me ask you this, do you  believe that there is within the NFL itself -- and I'm talking not to  management we know what the management is and the owners now.  There's no  more joke about what they'll -- they are.  But for the players, there  should be it seems to me, I hope that -- well, you could give me your  judgment, is there enough patriotism among those players to stand up for  the things that their fans care most about?  First the country in respect  for. </p><p>OWENS:  Well, this is why I'm glad that we have a president who drew a line  in the sand.  See what we're seeing on the field Lou, it's 20 years of  Marxist, socialist and atheists teaching our kids not to respect the flag,  not to say a prayer, not respect women or anything else.  So, these kids,  if you think about this, growing on for 20 years, 18, 20 years, hearing the  same anti-American, anti-white, anti-police.  They go stand on the  sidelines and believe that.  It doesn't matter what they have $20 million  in a pocketbook or one.  They're going to believe that because they've been  trained that.</p><p>We have around that field billions of dollars represented and not once have  they talked about collectively putting their funds together to start  businesses, how are these guys, these young men are not getting hired out  there educate our kids, our black kids that the left is not educating.  We  can do this within our own community if we understand we're up against.   This by the way, Americans do best.  We know we're in a fight and we're  going to fight right now.  It's our ideal Christian values against  Socialism, Marxism, atheism hates God.  And if we understand that,  understand what true evil is, then we'll stand up we'll win this fight.  We  need to start off at winning this particular midterm.  We need to push out  our American way further and not let the left do their deal.</p><p>DOBBS:  They're sure trying and you're absolutely right.  Burgess, thanks  for being with us.  Great to see you. </p><p>OWENS:  Thank you, Lou.  I appreciate it, buddy.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Burgess Owens, thank you, a great American.  Up next, Facebook  facing a massive fine for its latest major data breach but it's not the  United States concerned about just you know, married users.  You know, it's  at least according to well Silicon Valley.  We take it up with  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.  He's here next.  This is a big deal.   Stay with us, we'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  As I said, the President is speaking tonight at a rally in Johnson  City Tennessee.  He's there to support his Supreme Court two choice Judge  Brett Kavanaugh as well as Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn running for the  Senate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he  was announced because they know the Judge Kavanaugh will follow the  Constitution as written.  They're trying to destroy a very fine person and  we can't let it happen. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  European -- the European Union looking into fining Facebook for  more than $1 billion after the recent cyber-attack, 50 million users' data  taken in that attack.  Ireland's data protection commission is demanding  more information from Facebook about the scale of the data theft and the  cyber-attack you -- in which you residents were victimized in the attack.   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the company takes the breach very  seriously.  </p><p>You would think they would take it seriously.  50 million people's personal  data stolen in a cyber-attack and Facebook still doesn't know who is behind  the hack and we haven't been really given too much information about the  timeline when the attack occurred, when Facebook found out, and how they  notified 50 million people. </p><p>Joining us tonight cyber-security expert Morgan Wright, when -- and it's  great to see you, Morgan.  Thanks for being with us.  </p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  You bet, Lou. </p><p>There is such arrogance on the part of these big tech firms, social media,  it's -- it is really repulsive to hear Zuckerberg billionaire saying their  -- Facebook is taking this seriously.  Really?  Really?  They have to say  that.  My gosh. </p><p>Well, you know what strikes more fear into the heart of Mark Zuckerberg  than Batman, the GDPR and Irish Data Protection Commission because now  they're going to hit these companies where it hurts the most and that's  financially.  These -- all these companies wanted to be global and I in  your last seven you're talking to Burgess about the globalism, we'll all  these companies wants it global -- </p><p>DOBBS:  That was a great point was it, Burgess, I mean he nailed that. </p><p>WRIGHT:  He nailed -- he nailed it.  And -- but you know what, that  translates now into the business environment.  All these companies want to  be global, well guess what, now you have to play the baseline becomes the  strictest set of rules that are out there and the people who have them are  the E.U.  And you know what, they've actually got teeth behind these rules  to where now the Data Protection Commission, the little -- this little  agency in Ireland now is going to bring Facebook to the E.U. and say show  us the information and we'll decide if we're going to find you $1.6 billion  or not. </p><p>DOBBS:  And meanwhile, we have the CEO of Google telling basically all of  Congress, go to hell.  I'll show up and well talk with you privately and  maybe we'll talk sometime later.  You've got the chair of Facebook saying  we're taking it seriously when obviously it's the opposite or 50 million  people wouldn't have their user data, their personal data stolen a cyber- attack by Facebook knows not who. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Well you know -- and Lou, the other thing too about this.  This  wasn't Facebook data.  The way Facebook works too is they have what they  call single sign-on which means that you can use Facebook now to sign into  up services.  So not only was Facebook affected but if you signed a three  or four other sides using your Facebook credentials, you might have or had  your information stolen from those sites as well.  So it's much bigger than  Facebook alone. </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  That's why I said user personal data because of that  potentiality.  I -- what is the -- you know, all we're going to hear now  from Silicon Valley no regulation, no accountability of any kind.  They are  spending a fortune to make certain that they remain monopolistic.  For  example, Google sending reportedly tens of billions of dollars to do so.   The other companies, I'm sure doing -- social media companies they're doing  the same.  What can be done to bring them under control and to protect the  rights of citizens?  By the way, they're citizens not just consumers that  we -- that we have to say that for the benefit of the titans of Silicon  Valley. </p><p>WRIGHT:  You know, recently I wrote an article for Hill talking exactly  about this and nutty knows what their consumer rights or their data  protection rights are except to the E.U.  But I'll tell you, Lou, the other  thing that I think is going to strike fear into the hearts of these guys is  a gentleman by the name of Tim Berners-Lee.  He was one who originally  created the World Wide Web that runs on the internet.  He's now saying it's  time to take back control of our data, take back from Google so he's  building a system.  And I've seen part of this now, it works like you  actually control and own your data, nobody else owns it but you still get  the same functionality.  So I think -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Should this start -- should this start with the FCC is  contemporaneously with Congress? </p><p>WRIGHT:  It needs to start somewhere because, Lou, usually it has three  phases.  There's litigation -- there's regulation legislation. </p><p>DOBBS:  Got you.  Morgan, always great to get your thoughts and your  insights.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, appreciate it.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, sir. </p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, President Trump lays out what the upcoming Midterms mean  for him, for us, our country.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  This election is choice between a Republican Party that is building  our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  More from the President's rally in Tennessee -- </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, we're -- well, we have a new NAFTA agreement and it's the  USMCA for Canada and Mexico and President Trump crediting tariffs while  announcing the new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico.  The President  addressing that just moments ago from at a rally for Marsha Blackburn in  Johnson City, Tennessee.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have two wonderful partners now.  Now, they're partners Mexico  and Canada and that's a good thing.  That's a good thing.  America is  winning again and America is being respected again because we are finally  putting America first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  America first.  And a reminder to pre-order Burgess Owens' brand  new book.  Pre-order it.  The book Why I Stand: From Freedom to the Killing  Fields of Socialism.  It's out October 30th.  We recommend it highly.   Thanks for being with us.  Good night from New York.</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  The Senate's top  Republican has a warning for Democrats, quit delaying, obstructing, and  resisting the confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Our top stories, promise is kept. President Trump eking a trade deal with Canada and Mexico that does away with the job killing NAFTA replacing it with an agreement that is fair and reciprocal, putting America first.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Once approved by Congress, this new deal will be the most modern, up-to-date and balanced trade agreement in the history of our country. With the most advanced protections for workers ever developed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We'll take up the economic significance of President Trump's historic agreement with the director of the White House Trade Counsel, Peter Navarro. Also the FBI's 7th, seven, that's seven, investigations of Judge Brett Kavanaugh could conclude as early as tomorrow. Radical Dimm obstructionists are already criticizing the investigation, proving they have no regard for either the truth, their pledges, and are only interested in political results.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democrat Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Republican Strategist Ed Rollins, New York Post Columnist, Michael Goodwin here tonight to discuss the Supreme Court confirmation battle. And it is a battle to the death, it seems. NFL ratings taking another hit as Roger Goodell and the owners continue to do little in some cases absolutely nothing to address the remaining anthem controversy that has fans abandoning the sport in droves.</p><p>Retired player Burgess Owens joins us tonight to talk about what if anything can be done to turn the NFL round and to restore proper respect and regard for the very people who make it all possible, American fans. We begin with breaking news tonight. The Senate Majority Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell setting a time for the Senate to vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close. Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is out of committee, we're considering it here on the floor and Mr. President will be voting this week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Senator McConnell's commitment to the President comes as we learn that the FBI could, could wrap up its investigation into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh by tomorrow. Our other top stories, well, we'll lead off with a big one. President Trump tearing up NAFTA as promised, announcing a historic trade deal with Canada and Mexico finally putting America first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. To me it is the most important word in trade because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations, all over the world and we're changing that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: By the way, the President, I want to point this out very quickly, he's right about reciprocity as is often the case. The President is the first president in three decades to talk about reciprocity in a trade deal with the United States. It's extraordinary. The President winning a major concession with Canada, now easing restrictions on its dairy market, allowing American farmers to export about half a billion dollars worth of dairy products for the first time.</p><p>The agreement boosting the auto industry as well. Requirements for 75 percent of auto content to be made in North America, up from 62 percent and Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum remaining in place, a strategy he says led to today's new continental trade agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs, that includes Congress, so please don't charge tariffs, without tariffs you wouldn't be -- we wouldn't be standing here. And we're totally prepared to do that, if they don't negotiate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The President's tough tactics on trade leading to a deal last week with South Korea. The European Union has come to the negotiating table. As well, the United States and Japan have begun trade talks. And India is now also seeking a deal. President Trump today saying China wants to talk, \"very badly\", but the President also says it's too soon. The Trump administration just last week imposed tariffs on $200 billion of exports from China to the United States.</p><p>Our first guest tonight with the president during the Rose Garden trade announcement and joining us is Peter Navarro, assistant to the president, director of Trade and Industrial Policy, the director of the White House Trade Council. Good to have you with us, Peter. Let's turn first of all first of all -- well, first of all, let's say congratulations to you, to the Trumo White House, and to the President.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: One fine day in America, one fine day in North America with this deal. I always -- it was just precious being on the stage with the President. You know, he keeps saying, are you going to get tired of winning? It's been a great 10 days, I mean, deals with Japan, deals with South Korea.</p><p>DOBBS: -- almost two years --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAVARRO: It's amazing. This president is putting down a record that is the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history. It's just amazing. We don't hear about it on the press. But this record is amazing. The economy is amazing. And the funny thing, Lou, is that he always gets criticized for being too tough. Don't do this, don't try that. And sure enough it works. And it work like charm today and it's a good deal for both Canada and Mexico.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, I got to say to you, I don't think the president is being criticized that much anymore. I think he's certainly being criticized, you know, that part of the left, the national left-wing media, they're going to keep the nonsense up, they don't understand economics. They don't understand politics, history or the national interests. The President schools them each day. At some point you would think they would learn.</p><p>But as you watch the press today, you know, there's a group that it's not worth the time. You know, I look at this and I say this is terrific and for Mexico and Canada, does want to remain in something he calls the USMCA, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement instead of NAFTA. You know, I love that because it doesn't imply something that it's not. It's a trade agreement, straightforward, simple, for everybody to understand.</p><p>It doesn't imply a North American Free Trade Agreement because it's not. It is a reciprocal balanced trade agreement. And secondly it doesn't imply a North American Union, harmonization of borders and a coming together of three nations into one massive, you know, central command, of course, led by the elites. So, I'm very -- I'm thrilled with what the President has accomplished here.</p><p>NAVARRO: And really, it hits three points in the triangle. For me, having a deal that's going to make this hemisphere the regional manufacturing base for the world, it's going to bring back our supply chain through tough regional content rules and labor rules, that's number one. We've got modernization of the agreement so bring things in like digital trade and biologics which didn't exist in 1994.</p><p>And farmers made out very, very well today. Not just dairy, chicken, eggs, other things.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the Chinese who have been trying to run their propaganda through the newspapers in the Midwest and, you know, various outlets will be pleased to hear that.</p><p>NAVARRO: Well, there was some pretty strong signals in the agreement as well. There's a strong provision there on currency and currency manipulation. And last week, Lou, this went unnoticed like so much of what President Trump does. There was an amazing statement --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it doesn't go unnoticed here, Peter. I don't know who you are talking to, but this audience knows what he's doing.</p><p>NAVARRO: Absolutely, Lou. You've been on this for 20 years, and these days --</p><p>DOBBS: So what is it --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: What is it --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAVARRO: So last week Japan, Europe and the United States led by the Ambassador Lighthizer issued a joint statement basically condemning the practices of China with regard to forced technology transfer and these huge nonmarket subsidies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: I think that's Great, peter, but I got to be really honest with you. I'm ready for the statement that they're not going to permit the theft of intellectual property from this country ever again. And that as they continue intellectual property theft, there will be consequences. We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars as you know. I don't frankly give a darn about a collegial multi-state agreement.</p><p>I want this country to stand up and insist that it not happen further. I don't care if it's part of an agreement. The hell with the agreement. It's our property. It ought to stop. It ought to stop now. OK?</p><p>NAVARRO: I will give you an amen to that, Lou. And the President's already imposed $250 billion worth of tariffs on China for stealing our stuff.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I think that's wonderful.</p><p>NAVARRO: But this statement last week is important because it wasn't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: I appreciate it, Peter. We're out of time. I do. I'm thrilled that the President has succeeded in this agreement. This is a wonderful achievement for the administration, for this presidency. And for the director of the trade council. Congratulations, Peter. Thanks so much and --</p><p>NAVARRO: Thank so much, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: -- we -- nobody watching you on this broadcast is tired of winning at all. Thanks. Up next, the shameless national left-wing media using today's historic trade deal announcement to berate President Trump about Judge Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In a tweet this weekend, Mr. President, you said that it's incorrect to say you are limiting the scope of the FBI investigation.</p><p>TRUMP: What does that have to do with trade? I don't mind answering the question, but, you know, I would like to do the trade question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It has to do with the other headline in the news which is the Kavanaugh nomination.</p><p>TRUMP: No. But -- I know. But how about talking about trade and then we'll go to that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do have a question on the Kavanaugh thing when you get back to it if you take that. You will take that now?</p><p>TRUMP: No, no.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Well, the question --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You said the FBI should interview whoever they believe is appropriate. Does that include Julie Swetnick, the third accuser? And can you promise to release the full findings --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: Give me your question, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- after they finish the report, Mr. President?</p><p>TRUMP: Give me a question, please. Give her the mic, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you saying your White House has put no limitations on --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: No. My White House is doing whatever the Senators want.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: No, no. You don't --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who they should interview?</p><p>TRUMP: You don't understand what I'm saying. You do understand, you just don't want to report it that way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The President, you know, you wouldn't think there would be that many people who call themselves journalists, professionals, who don't understand about manners and respect for the President and the White House. We'll take that up with Ed Rollins and Michael Goodwin. Should the President be putting up with this nonsense? That's also part of the message as we continue in just one moment. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: A Senior Republican Senate source tells Fox News that the FBI's investigation into Judge Kavanaugh could wrap up as early as tomorrow. This after the President was asked at least -- are you ready? -- 11 questions about the Kavanaugh investigation and this at a time when the President has -- was seeking some kind of order dealing first with trade and then -- and I have to say, there is no recognizable standard of conduct in the White House for the President of the United States. This is outrageous.</p><p>And I'm -- and I'm saying this as a journalist. I am just outraged. The President stated once again he backs the investigation, but he wants it done according to the terms requested by the Senate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation, whatever that means according to the Senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority. I want them to do that. I want it to be comprehensive. I actually think it is a good thing for Judge Kavanaugh. I think it's actually a good thing, not a bad thing. I think it's a good thing. Now, with that being said, I'd like it to go quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The President's position is the same as when he called for it last week. But already the radical Dems are trying to -- well, they want to change the direction. They've made an agreement. They've torn that one up. And now they want a new one, and they want to tell everybody what the FBI should be looking into. You know, all of the subjects and issues and events that they didn't question Judge Kavanaugh about when they had the opportunity.</p><p>And they didn't when they had the opportunity to do the same with Dr. Ford. We wouldn't be in this position, had it not been for the tortured confused soul of the two-face Senator from Arizona, Snowflake, Arizona, by the way, Jeff Flake who said he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh without a supplemental FBI investigation. Flake admitting that he only called for the investigation because of his failed Senatorial career.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could you have done this if you were running for reelection?</p><p>REP. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA: No, not a chance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not a chance.</p><p>FLAKE: No. No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because politics has become too sharp? Too partisan?</p><p>FLAKE: Yes. There's no value to reaching across the aisle. There's no currency for that anymore. There's no incentive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Wait a minute. All the Democratic Senators on that committee were telling everybody this isn't a partisan moment. Yet Senator Flake has discovered something. It is a partisan moment, a bitterly hostile vicious partisan moment. In fact, despite Flake's call for an investigation, despite the radical Dems pushing for more and more and more, nothing will ever be good enough for the left.</p><p>New York Congressman Nadler talk about the left. He made it very clear no matter what the FBI finds, Congressional Dems will not be satisfied. They will not stop their smear campaign against Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D), NEW YORK: This has got to be thoroughly investigated. I hope the Senate will do so. If he is on the Supreme Court, and the Senate hasn't investigated, then I -- then the House will have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Isn't he eloquent? The House will have to. With only 36 days to go, until the midterms, statements like Nadler's make it clear what the radical left is and that the radical left will stop at nothing to undermine President Trump's agenda and destroy a great American jurist and a great American. Well, joining us tonight, top strategist for Great America PAC, former Reagan White House political director, Fox News Political Analyst, Ed Rollins.</p><p>New York Post Columnist, Fox Business Contributor, Michael Goodwin. Thank you both for being here. I have to ask you, watching those people in the White House Press Corps, ignorantly behave as they have, what in the world is going to turn that around because that is a way in which the national left-wing media is confusing the President's message and they are forcing the President to correct their ill-mannered disrespect.</p><p>MICHAEL GOODWIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. It is remarkable to watch it time and again. I mean, it's not just the questions they ask, but the argumentative tone. They interrupt the President. Never saw that before. But only this president. The good news is they don't seem to matter. I mean, his success is not dependent on their recognition of it. I think the people --</p><p>DOBBS: Isn't it time for somebody in that communications department? I mean somebody, whoever it may be, to start laying down some basic protocols and etiquette and just a baseline for just decent behavior?</p><p>GOODWIN: I think they have tried.</p><p>DOBBS: They have tried?</p><p>GOODWIN: Yes, yes. I mean, they have cut CNN out of certain meetings and things like that. The problem is, the media itself has now become so radicalized that it used to be that the press corps would sort of police its own behavior. Now it is just we're all -- we're all together against him, that's the mood.</p><p>DOBBS: Do you -- would you like one of these networks to try to perform, Ed? Without the President? I mean, if the President of the United States tells the communications people, anyone who interrupts me again, this has got to be, you know, it's got to end somewhere. CNN would -- could their ratings go lower? I can guarantee you they can go lower. You stop Jim Acosta from behaving as he does, acting out?</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the bottom line he doesn't have to deal with it that way. You know, President Obama to his credit basically always had four or five people he hand-picked he was going to call on. He didn't call on anybody else. He didn't have to go out to this PAC like this, we have a very important decision or announcement to make.</p><p>DOBBS: So what's going on?</p><p>ROLLINS: I think -- I think the White House communications operation is failing and our old friend Bill Shine he's got all of it. Put a choke collar on some of these people. And the President stand up there and perform.</p><p>DOBBS: I have never known Bill Shine to be a reticent force at an organization.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, he needs -- he needs to be. He's got the job now and he needs to basically create some discipline and not leave the President out there vulnerable to this PAC. The bottom line is he needs to stand out there and make the announcements and not have the press there answering questions.</p><p>GOODWIN: Yes. I think that's one way around it. You don't need to have a press conference.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the President enjoys it because he basically dribbles their little --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: He loves to banter and punts back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: -- the White House lawn. But it's -- first of all, but this is becoming extraordinary in the disrespect towards the President.</p><p>GOODWIN: Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely, it is.</p><p>DOBBS: They can't -- they can't compete with him intellectually. They have no knowledge base to deal with. They have no idea what in many instances there is no -- there is just no comparison with the president. Simply put, if they all talked at once, it still wouldn't be a fair fight. But at the same time, they are -- you know, it's a disturbance in the atmosphere.</p><p>ROLLINS: Who is going to control the agenda? Are they going to talk about what he -- they want to talk about what he -- they want to talk about even what the President wants to talk about and the accomplishments that he's made including today with this enormous treaty that no one thought he could pull it off and he's pulled it off.</p><p>DOBBS: Oh, it's extraordinary. Very quickly. Let's go to a number of things. Bernie Sanders quote -- let's -- I would request you inform the FBI you will not consider their work complete until blah, blah, blah, the same nonsense from Mazie Hirono, the Senator from Hawaii, you know, the bull flies every -- in every direction from these people. Why is anyone -- you know, to his credit, Senator McConnell says the vote comes this week. Good luck.</p><p>ROLLINS: Yes, yes, yes. And Grassley had a wonderful letter back at Sanders who -- look, I think the problem -- the Democrats revealed their hand too early and they made it clear. So now they have no credibility. When they have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Too early. Let's remind everybody that Chuck Schumer, the senior Senator from New York, you know, told everybody, declared he was going to stop -- he would destroy this guy, the day his name was announced.</p><p>GOODWIN: Twenty-three minutes after, I believe.</p><p>DOBBS: The day that his name was announced by the President for this post.</p><p>ROLLINS: If we learn the lesson on the value of these elections, if the House goes Democrat, Jerry Nadler will be chairman of the Oversight Committee.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, that's frightening. Should be frankly, it's frightening that he's there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: And Maxine Waters will be chairman of the financial banking institutions.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, that will be a move for Jamie Dimon. He will have some fun then, huh?</p><p>ROLLINS: So, just --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it's -- we're going to show everyone an ad right now, very quickly, we would like to run the commercial that Ed's PAC, the Great America PAC has just put out defending Judge Kavanaugh. Let's roll that, if we could, please.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: Judge Kavanaugh, I will oppose him with everything I've got.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Democrats admitted they would do anything to stop Judge Kavanaugh from the start. Instead of protecting Dr. Ford, they use her, leaking her story, when she asked to be anonymous. Democrats don't care about protecting women and they never have. Democrats have just one goal, expanding their power. We must confirm Judge Kavanaugh and reject the Democrat power grab.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Ed, I think you have put out a very powerful product there.</p><p>ROLLINS: It is a truthful ad.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely.</p><p>ROLLINS: All about power.</p><p>DOBBS: Michael, you get the last word.</p><p>GOODWIN: I was going to say to Ed, how do you really feel?</p><p>ROLLINS: Feel as strongly as Schumer does on the other side. This is a great man. He should be on this court.</p><p>DOBBS: Couldn't agree more.</p><p>GOODWIN: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Have we -- have we got unanimity here?</p><p>GOODWIN: Absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: All right. Let me bring the gavel down.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you, gentlemen, appreciate it. Be sure to vote in our poll tonight. Now that the President has secured the fair reciprocal trade deal with Canada and Mexico, economic growth is soaring. Stocks are near record highs. So what happens now? Do you think a single bit of naysaying on the part of left-wing savants who work for the fake news will admit they were completely wrong now and President Trump absolutely right?</p><p>Wow, I can't wait to hear from you on this one. I was -- I was just thinking of a couple of New York Times economics writers, Nobel Laureate one of them. Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs. Coming up next, a gift to the Republican Party, Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama are championing the Dems push to the radical left. More on these -- well, these hungry campaigners. We will let you decide what they are hungry for.</p><p>Washington Times Columnist Tammy Bruce joins me here next. We're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump talking tonight at a rally in Johnson City, Tennessee where he is supporting a senator -- the Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who wants to be the senator from Tennessee. Touting his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And just today we made history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job- killing disaster known as NAFTA, with a brand new U.S.-Mexico Canada. We added Canada, worked out great, trade agreement. And we're calling it USMCA, no more NAFTA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Straight forward. Former President Barack Obama putting his name behind -- are you ready? 260 radical Dems in the midterms. His extensive list includes self-described socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Andrew Gillum in Florida. A reminder in his eight years as President, Obama presided over the Democratic Party loss of 63 seats in the House, 10 in the Senate, as well as the loss of 12 governorships losing more than a thousand, thousand Democratic --Democrats in his mere eight years in office.</p><p>And if you needed more proof of just how desperate the Dems are, they're providing it, rolling out failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now to push their radical agenda. Those are cheers you hear from Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Imagine being able to hold this administration accountable and actually make progress when it comes to affordable health care, the rights of immigrants and refugees. The urgent challenge of climate change and yes, I could go on and on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: As she so often does. As promised it would be a blessing for the Republican Party as it seems that Dems still don't get why President Trump is in office and not Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Well, joining us now Tammy Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business contributor. Great to have you with us Tammy.</p><p>First, to listen to Obama, to listen to Clinton, there have to be Democratic candidates all over the country just quivering with fear at the impact.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Hillary it sounds like she's running to be President of the European Union, certainly not this country, right?</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: I look, we made a statement 2016 and both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton could not convince the American people when we had no idea how extraordinary Donald Trump really would be.</p><p>DOBBS: Around nefarious the Democrats were.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, exactly. Now, that we've learned, we've got these investigations, we found out exact -- well, I mean, it's really the tip of the iceberg what we've learned about them. But the fact is, Barack Obama destroyed the Democratic Party. That's why he has these very strange individuals that he is supporting. It's still though all about him, he's desperate to not be seen as a failure and so is Hillary Clinton.</p><p>DOBBS: It's too far too late.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, this is both of their problems. They never viewed the country as the priority.</p><p>DOBBS: So, all we have to do is give up a country. A constitutional republic --</p><p>BRUCE: Sure.</p><p>DOBBS: -- leave it in ashes so that --</p><p>BRUCE: Sure.</p><p>DOBBS: -- we can pretend we care about their legacies, my God.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, they never cared about, they still don't think about the average American --</p><p>DOBBS: No, they care about -- remember --</p><p>BRUCE: That is Donald Trump's strength.</p><p>DOBBS: They've demonstrated again in the Judiciary Committee how much they care about women.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, exactly.</p><p>DOBBS: I mean, they said on a woman's legitimate concerns and pain they said for six weeks, they acknowledge, they leaked it to the press despite her request for confidentiality. And you can't even hear a whisper in the left-wing media about holding them accountable. Dianne Feinstein, Cory Booker the list goes on.</p><p>BRUCE: Her own lawyers who were referred to her by Senator Feinstein. We now believe of course mislead Dr. Ford about what her options would be when it came to talking with the committee that they would go to California. She clearly testified that she was unaware of that offer effectively. That is the kind of thing that needs to be investigated and I believe that that is what we're going to be doing now, when it comes to how this woman was misled.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, we're becoming an investigative country, aren't we? The American people are going to have to take a look at what's in full view and make a determination. The radical element of this party is this, they've taken over the Democratic Party, their conduct. I mean, Chuck Schumer was in a bit shaded nuanced.</p><p>BRUCE: Not at all.</p><p>DOBBS: He said point-blank he was going to destroy the president's nominee if he could and that's what they have tried to do.</p><p>BRUCE: And they want to eliminate due process, they want you to be guilty and trying to prove yourself innocent. I said in a column months ago that the Democratic Party is really now Antifa. It is -- it is that radical element that has moved forward looking to destroy things for revenge with no plan for the future and no desire to govern.</p><p>DOBBS: You think -- do you think Kavanaugh gets the confirmation?</p><p>BRUCE: You know, it depends on what happens this week. It's a shame we've given them another week, but I think so, yes. I think we'll have it.</p><p>DOBBS: Tammy Bruce, thanks. Great to see you.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next President Trump's patriotism stands tall over the NFL.</p><p>DOBBS: Despite a marquee matchup last night between the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers ratings for Sunday Night Football fell 10 percent from the previous week. The NFL's national game on CBS between the Saints and Giants also the lowest rated national game of this young NFL season</p><p>Joining us tonight, former NFL player for the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders Burgess Owens, author of the new book Why I Stand: From Freedom to the Killing Fields of Socialism. Burgess, great to have you with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>BURGESS OWENS, AUTHOR, WHY I STAND: Ho you doing, Lou? Looking forward to chatting with you my friend.</p><p>DOBBS: And to you -- you know, it's just great to have you here. I just want to turn first to that game last night, these ratings for the NFL, no one should start organizing a benefit for the NFL. But my goodness, this is just getting worse and worse.</p><p>OWENS: Yes, well first of all, I didn't see the game. I haven't really seen a game for two years. So, well, it comes down to it Lou, we have to understand that this is -- this is on purpose. We have an organization who in the past was very patriotic. We all remember the Al Davis days and Pete Rozelle, we're now dealing with globalists.</p><p>Then, there's two types by the way, there's the Republican and Democratic globalist who care more about profits and patriotism and then, there's the worst of the two as a leftist globalist who care about the socialist agenda over patriotism.</p><p>We have an organization, it cares more about their international reach than it care about the American brand and America -- and the American -- the NFL fan. These guys have already put in place 80 different countries, they wanted they put into 200 like the Soccer League has. It's all about T.V. revenue. They could care less about how full these stadiums are. They get their money and they share profits based on that T.V. revenue. If they can do in a global fashion, they'll be just like the soccer league with 200 countries tie-in no brand, no country brand but a global brand.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>OWENS: And that's what their answer in the process of doing as they demean our flag, demeaning our culture. So, they will be accepted another place like China and France and the other countries that are not so pro-American.</p><p>DOBBS: As you -- as you put it and I have heard no one -- I mean, thank you for that insight because frankly I hadn't considered that. And I suspect that lots of folks are just for the first time kind of wrapping their heads around globalism its impact on the NFL. And of course, that's cumbersome. I mean, we've seen it with this most recent movie about Neil Armstrong and his -- you know, walking for the first time on the face of the Moon.</p><p>OWENS: Grab the flag.</p><p>DOBBS: A great patriotic American, a great -- you, he was just an amazing pilot, decorated. He was just an amazing fellow. And the American flag is in front and center.</p><p>And the -- and the reality is, you're right, the American flag becomes an avatar for something that could maybe depress their global -- their global expansion at the NFL.</p><p>OWENS: Well, Lou, follow the money. We have a commissioner who just signed a contract with $40 million per year. Only 10 percent of that for me is guaranteed, the other 90 percent is based on his sentence. Now, understand, they've been dropping 20 percent, 13 percent of (INAUDIBLE) last year, last couple years.</p><p>But yet, then it capped -- or get capped out by the way 13 billion in the United States. We have to project in 27 billion in the next nine years globally.</p><p>So, no, they don't care about America, they don't care about the American fan who put them in place they are right now. They're globalists and globalist care more about their pocketbooks and their profits and the best thing we can do is obviously not showing up is good thing but we need to stop supporting their sponsors. T.V. revenue is what gets into where they are and now they share that equally, if we can we can hit them hard enough, so that we hit them before they get their global things in place. And maybe they'll fire this commissioner and get somebody who cares about our country about it -- about this brand and not trying to destroy.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, that is a lot to consider. Let me ask you this, do you believe that there is within the NFL itself -- and I'm talking not to management we know what the management is and the owners now. There's no more joke about what they'll -- they are. But for the players, there should be it seems to me, I hope that -- well, you could give me your judgment, is there enough patriotism among those players to stand up for the things that their fans care most about? First the country in respect for.</p><p>OWENS: Well, this is why I'm glad that we have a president who drew a line in the sand. See what we're seeing on the field Lou, it's 20 years of Marxist, socialist and atheists teaching our kids not to respect the flag, not to say a prayer, not respect women or anything else. So, these kids, if you think about this, growing on for 20 years, 18, 20 years, hearing the same anti-American, anti-white, anti-police. They go stand on the sidelines and believe that. It doesn't matter what they have $20 million in a pocketbook or one. They're going to believe that because they've been trained that.</p><p>We have around that field billions of dollars represented and not once have they talked about collectively putting their funds together to start businesses, how are these guys, these young men are not getting hired out there educate our kids, our black kids that the left is not educating. We can do this within our own community if we understand we're up against. This by the way, Americans do best. We know we're in a fight and we're going to fight right now. It's our ideal Christian values against Socialism, Marxism, atheism hates God. And if we understand that, understand what true evil is, then we'll stand up we'll win this fight. We need to start off at winning this particular midterm. We need to push out our American way further and not let the left do their deal.</p><p>DOBBS: They're sure trying and you're absolutely right. Burgess, thanks for being with us. Great to see you.</p><p>OWENS: Thank you, Lou. I appreciate it, buddy.</p><p>DOBBS: Burgess Owens, thank you, a great American. Up next, Facebook facing a massive fine for its latest major data breach but it's not the United States concerned about just you know, married users. You know, it's at least according to well Silicon Valley. We take it up with cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright. He's here next. This is a big deal. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: As I said, the President is speaking tonight at a rally in Johnson City Tennessee. He's there to support his Supreme Court two choice Judge Brett Kavanaugh as well as Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn running for the Senate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he was announced because they know the Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written. They're trying to destroy a very fine person and we can't let it happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: European -- the European Union looking into fining Facebook for more than $1 billion after the recent cyber-attack, 50 million users' data taken in that attack. Ireland's data protection commission is demanding more information from Facebook about the scale of the data theft and the cyber-attack you -- in which you residents were victimized in the attack. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the company takes the breach very seriously.</p><p>You would think they would take it seriously. 50 million people's personal data stolen in a cyber-attack and Facebook still doesn't know who is behind the hack and we haven't been really given too much information about the timeline when the attack occurred, when Facebook found out, and how they notified 50 million people.</p><p>Joining us tonight cyber-security expert Morgan Wright, when -- and it's great to see you, Morgan. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT: You bet, Lou.</p><p>There is such arrogance on the part of these big tech firms, social media, it's -- it is really repulsive to hear Zuckerberg billionaire saying their -- Facebook is taking this seriously. Really? Really? They have to say that. My gosh.</p><p>Well, you know what strikes more fear into the heart of Mark Zuckerberg than Batman, the GDPR and Irish Data Protection Commission because now they're going to hit these companies where it hurts the most and that's financially. These -- all these companies wanted to be global and I in your last seven you're talking to Burgess about the globalism, we'll all these companies wants it global --</p><p>DOBBS: That was a great point was it, Burgess, I mean he nailed that.</p><p>WRIGHT: He nailed -- he nailed it. And -- but you know what, that translates now into the business environment. All these companies want to be global, well guess what, now you have to play the baseline becomes the strictest set of rules that are out there and the people who have them are the E.U. And you know what, they've actually got teeth behind these rules to where now the Data Protection Commission, the little -- this little agency in Ireland now is going to bring Facebook to the E.U. and say show us the information and we'll decide if we're going to find you $1.6 billion or not.</p><p>DOBBS: And meanwhile, we have the CEO of Google telling basically all of Congress, go to hell. I'll show up and well talk with you privately and maybe we'll talk sometime later. You've got the chair of Facebook saying we're taking it seriously when obviously it's the opposite or 50 million people wouldn't have their user data, their personal data stolen a cyber- attack by Facebook knows not who.</p><p>WRIGHT: Well you know -- and Lou, the other thing too about this. This wasn't Facebook data. The way Facebook works too is they have what they call single sign-on which means that you can use Facebook now to sign into up services. So not only was Facebook affected but if you signed a three or four other sides using your Facebook credentials, you might have or had your information stolen from those sites as well. So it's much bigger than Facebook alone.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. That's why I said user personal data because of that potentiality. I -- what is the -- you know, all we're going to hear now from Silicon Valley no regulation, no accountability of any kind. They are spending a fortune to make certain that they remain monopolistic. For example, Google sending reportedly tens of billions of dollars to do so. The other companies, I'm sure doing -- social media companies they're doing the same. What can be done to bring them under control and to protect the rights of citizens? By the way, they're citizens not just consumers that we -- that we have to say that for the benefit of the titans of Silicon Valley.</p><p>WRIGHT: You know, recently I wrote an article for Hill talking exactly about this and nutty knows what their consumer rights or their data protection rights are except to the E.U. But I'll tell you, Lou, the other thing that I think is going to strike fear into the hearts of these guys is a gentleman by the name of Tim Berners-Lee. He was one who originally created the World Wide Web that runs on the internet. He's now saying it's time to take back control of our data, take back from Google so he's building a system. And I've seen part of this now, it works like you actually control and own your data, nobody else owns it but you still get the same functionality. So I think --</p><p>DOBBS: Should this start -- should this start with the FCC is contemporaneously with Congress?</p><p>WRIGHT: It needs to start somewhere because, Lou, usually it has three phases. There's litigation -- there's regulation legislation.</p><p>DOBBS: Got you. Morgan, always great to get your thoughts and your insights.</p><p>WRIGHT: You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Morgan, appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes, sir.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, President Trump lays out what the upcoming Midterms mean for him, for us, our country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: This election is choice between a Republican Party that is building our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: More from the President's rally in Tennessee --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, we're -- well, we have a new NAFTA agreement and it's the USMCA for Canada and Mexico and President Trump crediting tariffs while announcing the new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico. The President addressing that just moments ago from at a rally for Marsha Blackburn in Johnson City, Tennessee.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have two wonderful partners now. Now, they're partners Mexico and Canada and that's a good thing. That's a good thing. America is winning again and America is being respected again because we are finally putting America first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: America first. And a reminder to pre-order Burgess Owens' brand new book. Pre-order it. The book Why I Stand: From Freedom to the Killing Fields of Socialism. It's out October 30th. We recommend it highly. Thanks for being with us.

Our top  stories, promise is kept.  President Trump eking a trade deal with Canada  and Mexico that does away with the job killing NAFTA replacing it with an  agreement that is fair and reciprocal, putting America first. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Once approved by Congress,  this new deal will be the most modern, up-to-date and balanced trade  agreement in the history of our country.  With the most advanced  protections for workers ever developed.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  We'll take up the economic significance of President Trump's  historic agreement with the director of the White House Trade Counsel,  Peter Navarro.  Also the FBI's 7th, seven, that's seven, investigations of  Judge Brett Kavanaugh could conclude as early as tomorrow.  Radical Dimm  obstructionists are already criticizing the investigation, proving they  have no regard for either the truth, their pledges, and are only interested  in political results.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless  and outrageous tactics of the Democrat Party.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  Republican Strategist Ed Rollins, New York Post Columnist, Michael  Goodwin here tonight to discuss the Supreme Court confirmation battle.  And  it is a battle to the death, it seems.  NFL ratings taking another hit as  Roger Goodell and the owners continue to do little in some cases absolutely  nothing to address the remaining anthem controversy that has fans  abandoning the sport in droves.</p><p> Retired player Burgess Owens joins us tonight to talk about what if  anything can be done to turn the NFL round and to restore proper respect  and regard for the very people who make it all possible, American fans.  We  begin with breaking news tonight.  The Senate Majority Leader, Senator  Mitch McConnell setting a time for the Senate to vote on Judge Brett  Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  The time for endless  delay and obstruction has come to a close.  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is  out of committee, we're considering it here on the floor and Mr. President  will be voting this week.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  Senator McConnell's commitment to the President comes as we learn  that the FBI could, could wrap up its investigation into allegations  against Judge Kavanaugh by tomorrow.  Our other top stories, well, we'll  lead off with a big one.  President Trump tearing up NAFTA as promised,  announcing a historic trade deal with Canada and Mexico finally putting  America first.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  We have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of  fairness and reciprocity.  To me it is the most important word in trade  because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations, all over the  world and we're changing that.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  By the way, the President, I want to point this out very quickly,  he's right about reciprocity as is often the case.  The President is the  first president in three decades to talk about reciprocity in a trade deal  with the United States.  It's extraordinary.  The President winning a major  concession with Canada, now easing restrictions on its dairy market,  allowing American farmers to export about half a billion dollars worth of  dairy products for the first time.</p><p> The agreement boosting the auto industry as well.  Requirements for 75  percent of auto content to be made in North America, up from 62 percent and  Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum remaining in place, a strategy he  says led to today's new continental trade agreement.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  Just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs,  that includes Congress, so please don't charge tariffs, without tariffs you  wouldn't be -- we wouldn't be standing here.  And we're totally prepared to  do that, if they don't negotiate.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  The President's tough tactics on trade leading to a deal last week  with South Korea.  The European Union has come to the negotiating table.   As well, the United States and Japan have begun trade talks.  And India is  now also seeking a deal.  President Trump today saying China wants to talk,  \"very badly\", but the President also says it's too soon.  The Trump  administration just last week imposed tariffs on $200 billion of exports  from China to the United States.</p><p> Our first guest tonight with the president during the Rose Garden trade  announcement and joining us is Peter Navarro, assistant to the president,  director of Trade and Industrial Policy, the director of the White House  Trade Council.  Good to have you with us, Peter.  Let's turn first of all  first of all -- well, first of all, let's say congratulations to you, to  the Trumo White House, and to the President.  </p><p> PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  One fine day  in America, one fine day in North America with this deal.  I always -- it  was just precious being on the stage with the President.  You know, he  keeps saying, are you going to get tired of winning?   It's been a great 10  days, I mean, deals with Japan, deals with South Korea.  </p><p> DOBBS:  -- almost two years -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NAVARRO:  It's amazing.  This president is putting down a record that is  the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern  history.  It's just amazing.  We don't hear about it on the press.  But  this record is amazing.  The economy is amazing.  And the funny thing, Lou,  is that he always gets criticized for being too tough.  Don't do this,  don't try that.  And sure enough it works.  And it work like charm today  and it's a good deal for both Canada and Mexico.  </p><p> DOBBS:  You know, I got to say to you, I don't think the president is being  criticized that much anymore.  I think he's certainly being criticized, you  know, that part of the left, the national left-wing media, they're going to  keep the nonsense up, they don't understand economics.  They don't  understand politics, history or the national interests.  The President  schools them each day.  At some point you would think they would learn.</p><p> But as you watch the press today, you know, there's a group that it's not  worth the time.  You know, I look at this and I say this is terrific and  for Mexico and Canada, does want to remain in something he calls the USMCA,  the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement instead of NAFTA.  You know, I  love that because it doesn't imply something that it's not.  It's a trade  agreement, straightforward, simple, for everybody to understand.</p><p> It doesn't imply a North American Free Trade Agreement because it's not.   It is a reciprocal balanced trade agreement.  And secondly it doesn't imply  a North American Union, harmonization of borders and a coming together of  three nations into one massive, you know, central command, of course, led  by the elites.  So, I'm very -- I'm thrilled with what the President has  accomplished here.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  And really, it hits three points in the triangle.  For me, having  a deal that's going to make this hemisphere the regional manufacturing base  for the world, it's going to bring back our supply chain through tough  regional content rules and labor rules, that's number one.  We've got  modernization of the agreement so bring things in like digital trade and  biologics which didn't exist in 1994.</p><p> And farmers made out very, very well today.  Not just dairy, chicken, eggs,  other things.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, the Chinese who have been trying to run their propaganda  through the newspapers in the Midwest and, you know, various outlets will  be pleased to hear that.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Well, there was some pretty strong signals in the agreement as  well.  There's a strong provision there on currency and currency  manipulation.  And last week, Lou, this went unnoticed like so much of what  President Trump does.  There was an amazing statement -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, it doesn't go unnoticed here, Peter.  I don't know who you  are talking to, but this audience knows what he's doing.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Absolutely, Lou.  You've been on this for 20 years, and these  days -- </p><p> DOBBS:  So what is it -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DOBBS:  What is it -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> NAVARRO:  So last week Japan, Europe and the United States led by the  Ambassador Lighthizer issued a joint statement basically condemning the  practices of China with regard to forced technology transfer and these huge  nonmarket subsidies.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DOBBS:  I think that's Great, peter, but I got to be really honest with  you.  I'm ready for the statement that they're not going to permit the  theft of intellectual property from this country ever again.  And that as  they continue intellectual property theft, there will be consequences.   We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars as you know.  I don't frankly  give a darn about a collegial multi-state agreement.</p><p> I want this country to stand up and insist that it not happen further.  I  don't care if it's part of an agreement.  The hell with the agreement.   It's our property.  It ought to stop.  It ought to stop now.  OK?</p><p> NAVARRO:  I will give you an amen to that, Lou.  And the President's  already imposed $250 billion worth of tariffs on China for stealing our  stuff.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, I think that's wonderful.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  But this statement last week is important because it wasn't -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DOBBS:  I appreciate it, Peter.  We're out of time.  I do.  I'm thrilled  that the President has succeeded in this agreement.  This is a wonderful  achievement for the administration, for this presidency.  And for the  director of the trade council.  Congratulations, Peter.  Thanks so much and  --</p><p> NAVARRO:  Thank so much, Lou.</p><p> DOBBS:  -- we -- nobody watching you on this broadcast is tired of winning  at all.   Thanks.  Up next, the shameless national left-wing media using today's  historic trade deal announcement to berate President Trump about Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In a tweet this weekend, Mr. President, you said that  it's incorrect to say you are limiting the scope of the FBI investigation.  </p><p> TRUMP:  What does that have to do with trade?  I don't mind answering the  question, but, you know, I would like to do the trade question.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It has to do with the other headline in the news  which is the Kavanaugh nomination.  </p><p> TRUMP:  No.  But -- I know.  But how about talking about trade and then  we'll go to that.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do have a question on the Kavanaugh thing when you  get back to it if you take that.  You will take that now?  </p><p> TRUMP:  No, no.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Well, the question --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You said the FBI should interview whoever they  believe is appropriate.  Does that include Julie Swetnick, the third  accuser?  And can you promise to release the full findings -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TRUMP:  Give me your question, please.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- after they finish the report, Mr. President?</p><p> TRUMP:  Give me a question, please.  Give her the mic, please.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you saying your White House has put no  limitations on -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TRUMP:  No.  My White House is doing whatever the Senators want.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TRUMP:  No, no.  You don't -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Who they should interview?  </p><p> TRUMP:  You don't understand what I'm saying.  You do understand, you just  don't want to report it that way.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  The President, you know, you wouldn't think there would be that  many people who call themselves journalists, professionals, who don't  understand about manners and respect for the President and the White House.   We'll take that up with Ed Rollins and Michael Goodwin.  Should the  President be putting up with this nonsense?  That's also part of the  message as we continue in just one moment.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  DOBBS:  A Senior Republican Senate source tells Fox News that the FBI's  investigation into Judge Kavanaugh could wrap up as early as tomorrow.   This after the President was asked at least -- are you ready?  -- 11  questions about the Kavanaugh investigation and this at a time when the  President has -- was seeking some kind of order dealing first with trade  and then -- and I have to say, there is no recognizable standard of conduct  in the White House for the President of the United States.  This is  outrageous.</p><p> And I'm -- and I'm saying this as a journalist.  I am just outraged.  The  President stated once again he backs the investigation, but he wants it  done according to the terms requested by the Senate.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation, whatever that  means according to the Senators and the Republicans and the Republican  majority.  I want them to do that.  I want it to be comprehensive.  I  actually think it is a good thing for Judge Kavanaugh.  I think it's  actually a good thing, not a bad thing.  I think it's a good thing.  Now,  with that being said, I'd like it to go quickly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  The President's position is the same as when he called for it last  week.  But already the radical Dems are trying to -- well, they want to  change the direction.  They've made an agreement.  They've torn that one  up.  And now they want a new one, and they want to tell everybody what the  FBI should be looking into.  You know, all of the subjects and issues and  events that they didn't question Judge Kavanaugh about when they had the  opportunity.</p><p> And they didn't when they had the opportunity to do the same with Dr. Ford.   We wouldn't be in this position, had it not been for the tortured confused  soul of the two-face Senator from Arizona, Snowflake, Arizona, by the way,  Jeff Flake who said he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh without a  supplemental FBI investigation.  Flake admitting that he only called for  the investigation because of his failed Senatorial career.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could you have done this if you were running for  reelection?  </p><p> REP. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  No, not a chance.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not a chance.</p><p> FLAKE:  No.  No.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because politics has become too sharp?  Too partisan?  </p><p> FLAKE:  Yes.  There's no value to reaching across the aisle.  There's no  currency for that anymore.  There's no incentive.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  Wait a minute.  All the Democratic Senators on that committee were  telling everybody this isn't a partisan moment.  Yet Senator Flake has  discovered something.  It is a partisan moment, a bitterly hostile vicious  partisan moment.  In fact, despite Flake's call for an investigation,  despite the radical Dems pushing for more and more and more, nothing will  ever be good enough for the left.</p><p> New York Congressman Nadler talk about the left.  He made it very clear no  matter what the FBI finds, Congressional Dems will not be satisfied.  They  will not stop their smear campaign against Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. JERRY NADLER (D), NEW YORK:  This has got to be thoroughly  investigated.  I hope the Senate will do so.  If he is on the Supreme  Court, and the Senate hasn't investigated, then I -- then the House will  have to. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  Isn't he eloquent?  The House will have to.  With only 36 days to  go, until the midterms, statements like Nadler's make it clear what the  radical left is and that the radical left will stop at nothing to undermine  President Trump's agenda and destroy a great American jurist and a great  American.  Well, joining us tonight, top strategist for Great America PAC,  former Reagan White House political director, Fox News Political Analyst,  Ed Rollins.</p><p> New York Post Columnist, Fox Business Contributor, Michael Goodwin.  Thank  you both for being here.  I have to ask you, watching those people in the  White House Press Corps, ignorantly behave as they have, what in the world  is going to turn that around because that is a way in which the national  left-wing media is confusing the President's message and they are forcing  the President to correct their ill-mannered disrespect.  </p><p> MICHAEL GOODWIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  It is remarkable to watch it  time and again.  I mean, it's not just the questions they ask, but the  argumentative tone.  They interrupt the President.  Never saw that before.   But only this president.  The good news is they don't seem to matter.  I  mean, his success is not dependent on their recognition of it.  I think the  people -- </p><p> DOBBS:  Isn't it time for somebody in that communications department?  I  mean somebody, whoever it may be, to start laying down some basic protocols  and etiquette and just a baseline for just decent behavior? </p><p> GOODWIN:  I think they have tried.  </p><p> DOBBS:  They have tried?  </p><p> GOODWIN:  Yes, yes.  I mean, they have cut CNN out of certain meetings and  things like that.  The problem is, the media itself has now become so  radicalized that it used to be that the press corps would sort of police  its own behavior.  Now it is just we're all -- we're all together against  him, that's the mood.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Do you -- would you like one of these networks to try to perform,  Ed?  Without the President?  I mean, if the President of the United States  tells the communications people, anyone who interrupts me again, this has  got to be, you know, it's got to end somewhere.  CNN would -- could their  ratings go lower?  I can guarantee you they can go lower.  You stop Jim  Acosta from behaving as he does, acting out?  </p><p> ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, the bottom line he doesn't have to  deal with it that way.  You know, President Obama to his credit basically  always had four or five people he hand-picked he was going to call on.  He  didn't call on anybody else.  He didn't have to go out to this PAC like  this, we have a very important decision or announcement to make.</p><p> DOBBS:  So what's going on?  </p><p> ROLLINS:  I think -- I think the White House communications operation is  failing and our old friend Bill Shine he's got all of it.  Put a choke  collar on some of these people.  And the President stand up there and  perform.  </p><p> DOBBS:  I have never known Bill Shine to be a reticent force at an  organization.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, he needs -- he needs to be.  He's got the job now and he  needs to basically create some discipline and not leave the President out  there vulnerable to this PAC.  The bottom line is he needs to stand out  there and make the announcements and not have the press there answering  questions.  </p><p> GOODWIN:  Yes.  I think that's one way around it.  You don't need to have a  press conference.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, the President enjoys it because he basically dribbles their  little -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ROLLINS:  He loves to banter and punts back.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DOBBS:  -- the White House lawn.  But it's -- first of all, but this is  becoming extraordinary in the disrespect towards the President.  </p><p> GOODWIN:  Yes.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Absolutely, it is.</p><p> DOBBS:  They can't -- they can't compete with him intellectually.  They  have no knowledge base to deal with.  They have no idea what in many  instances there is no -- there is just no comparison with the president.   Simply put, if they all talked at once, it still wouldn't be a fair fight.   But at the same time, they are -- you know, it's a disturbance in the  atmosphere.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Who is going to control the agenda?  Are they going to talk about  what he -- they want to talk about what he -- they want to talk about even  what the President wants to talk about and the accomplishments that he's  made including today with this enormous treaty that no one thought he could  pull it off and he's pulled it off.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Oh, it's extraordinary.  Very quickly.  Let's go to a number of  things.  Bernie Sanders quote -- let's -- I would request you inform the  FBI you will not consider their work complete until blah, blah, blah, the  same nonsense from Mazie Hirono, the Senator from Hawaii, you know, the  bull flies every -- in every direction from these people.  Why is anyone --  you know, to his credit, Senator McConnell says the vote comes this week.   Good luck.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Yes, yes, yes.  And Grassley had a wonderful letter back at  Sanders who -- look, I think the problem -- the Democrats revealed their  hand too early and they made it clear.  So now they have no credibility.   When they have --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Too early.  Let's remind everybody that Chuck Schumer, the senior  Senator from New York, you know, told everybody, declared he was going to  stop -- he would destroy this guy, the day his name was announced.  </p><p> GOODWIN:  Twenty-three minutes after, I believe.  </p><p> DOBBS:  The day that his name was announced by the President for this post.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  If we learn the lesson on the value of these elections, if the  House goes Democrat, Jerry Nadler will be chairman of the Oversight  Committee.  </p><p> DOBBS:  You know, that's frightening.  Should be frankly, it's frightening  that he's there.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> DOBBS:  And Maxine Waters will be chairman of the financial banking  institutions.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, that will be a move for Jamie Dimon.  He will have some fun  then, huh?</p><p> ROLLINS:  So, just -- </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, it's -- we're going to show everyone an ad right now, very  quickly, we would like to run the commercial that Ed's PAC, the Great  America PAC has just put out defending Judge Kavanaugh.  Let's roll that,  if we could, please.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SCHUMER:  Judge Kavanaugh, I will oppose him with everything I've got.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Democrats admitted they would do anything to stop  Judge Kavanaugh from the start.  Instead of protecting Dr. Ford, they use  her, leaking her story, when she asked to be anonymous.  Democrats don't  care about protecting women and they never have.  Democrats have just one  goal, expanding their power.  We must confirm Judge Kavanaugh and reject  the Democrat power grab.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, Ed, I think you have put out a very powerful product there.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  It is a truthful ad.</p><p> DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p> ROLLINS:  All about power.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Michael, you get the last word.  </p><p> GOODWIN:  I was going to say to Ed, how do you really feel? </p><p> ROLLINS:  Feel as strongly as Schumer does on the other side.  This is a  great man.  He should be on this court.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Couldn't agree more.  </p><p> GOODWIN:  Yes.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Have we -- have we got unanimity here?  </p><p> GOODWIN:  Absolutely.  </p><p> DOBBS:  All right.  Let me bring the gavel down.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p> DOBBS:  Thank you, gentlemen, appreciate it.  Be sure to vote in our poll  tonight.  Now that the President has secured the fair reciprocal trade deal  with Canada and Mexico, economic growth is soaring.  Stocks are near record  highs.  So what happens now?  Do you think a single bit of naysaying on the  part of left-wing savants who work for the fake news will admit they were  completely wrong now and President Trump absolutely right?</p><p> Wow, I can't wait to hear from you on this one.  I was -- I was just  thinking of a couple of New York Times economics writers, Nobel Laureate  one of them.  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  Coming up next, a gift  to the Republican Party, Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama are championing  the Dems push to the radical left.  More on these -- well, these hungry  campaigners.  We will let you decide what they are hungry for.</p><p> Washington Times Columnist Tammy Bruce joins me here next.  We're coming  right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  President Trump talking tonight at a rally in Johnson City,  Tennessee where he is supporting a senator -- the Congresswoman Marsha  Blackburn who wants to be the senator from Tennessee.  Touting his new  trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And just today we made  history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job- killing disaster known as NAFTA, with a brand new U.S.-Mexico Canada.  We  added Canada, worked out great, trade agreement.  And we're calling it  USMCA, no more NAFTA.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  Straight forward.  Former President Barack Obama putting his name  behind -- are you ready?  260 radical Dems in the midterms.  His extensive  list includes self-described socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New  York, Andrew Gillum in Florida.  A reminder in his eight years as  President, Obama presided over the Democratic Party loss of 63 seats in the  House, 10 in the Senate, as well as the loss of 12 governorships losing  more than a thousand, thousand Democratic --Democrats in his mere eight  years in office.  </p><p> And if you needed more proof of just how desperate the Dems are, they're  providing it, rolling out failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now  to push their radical agenda.  Those are cheers you hear from Republicans.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Imagine being able to hold  this administration accountable and actually make progress when it comes to  affordable health care, the rights of immigrants and refugees.  The urgent  challenge of climate change and yes, I could go on and on.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  As she so often does.  As promised it would be a blessing for the  Republican Party as it seems that Dems still don't get why President Trump  is in office and not Hillary Clinton. </p><p> Well, joining us now Tammy Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business  contributor.  Great to have you with us Tammy.</p><p> First, to listen to Obama, to listen to Clinton, there have to be  Democratic candidates all over the country just quivering with fear at the  impact.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, Hillary it sounds like  she's running to be President of the European Union, certainly not this  country, right?</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> BRUCE:  I look, we made a statement 2016 and both Barack Obama and Hillary  Clinton could not convince the American people when we had no idea how  extraordinary Donald Trump really would be.</p><p> DOBBS:  Around nefarious the Democrats were.</p><p> BRUCE:  Well, exactly.  Now, that we've learned, we've got these  investigations, we found out exact -- well, I mean, it's really the tip of  the iceberg what we've learned about them.  But the fact is, Barack Obama  destroyed the Democratic Party.  That's why he has these very strange  individuals that he is supporting.  It's still though all about him, he's  desperate to not be seen as a failure and so is Hillary Clinton.</p><p> DOBBS:  It's too far too late.</p><p> BRUCE:  Well, this is both of their problems.  They never viewed the  country as the priority.</p><p> DOBBS:  So, all we have to do is give up a country.  A constitutional  republic --</p><p> BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p> DOBBS:  -- leave it in ashes so that --</p><p> BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p> DOBBS:  -- we can pretend we care about their legacies, my God.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes, they never cared about, they still don't think about the  average American --</p><p> DOBBS:  No, they care about -- remember --</p><p> BRUCE:  That is Donald Trump's strength.  </p><p> DOBBS:  They've demonstrated again in the Judiciary Committee how much they  care about women.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> DOBBS:  I mean, they said on a woman's legitimate concerns and pain they  said for six weeks, they acknowledge, they leaked it to the press despite  her request for confidentiality.  And you can't even hear a whisper in the  left-wing media about holding them accountable.  Dianne Feinstein, Cory  Booker the list goes on.</p><p> BRUCE:  Her own lawyers who were referred to her by Senator Feinstein.  We  now believe of course mislead Dr. Ford about what her options would be when  it came to talking with the committee that they would go to California.   She clearly testified that she was unaware of that offer effectively.  That  is the kind of thing that needs to be investigated and I believe that that  is what we're going to be doing now, when it comes to how this woman was  misled.</p><p> DOBBS:  You know, we're becoming an investigative country, aren't we?  The  American people are going to have to take a look at what's in full view and  make a determination.  The radical element of this party is this, they've  taken over the Democratic Party, their conduct.  I mean, Chuck Schumer was  in a bit shaded nuanced.</p><p> BRUCE:  Not at all.</p><p> DOBBS:  He said point-blank he was going to destroy the president's nominee  if he could and that's what they have tried to do.</p><p> BRUCE:  And they want to eliminate due process, they want you to be guilty  and trying to prove yourself innocent.  I said in a column months ago that  the Democratic Party is really now Antifa.  It is -- it is that radical  element that has moved forward looking to destroy things for revenge with  no plan for the future and no desire to govern.</p><p> DOBBS:  You think -- do you think Kavanaugh gets the confirmation?</p><p> BRUCE:  You know, it depends on what happens this week.  It's a shame we've  given them another week, but I think so, yes.  I think we'll have it.</p><p> DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Great to see you.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you, sir.</p><p> DOBBS:  Up next President Trump's patriotism stands tall over the NFL.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> DOBBS:  Despite a marquee matchup last night between the Baltimore Ravens  and Pittsburgh Steelers ratings for Sunday Night Football fell 10 percent  from the previous week.  The NFL's national game on CBS between the Saints  and Giants also the lowest rated national game of this young NFL season</p><p> Joining us tonight, former NFL player for the New York Jets and the Oakland  Raiders Burgess Owens, author of the new book Why I Stand: From Freedom to  the Killing Fields of Socialism.  Burgess, great to have you with us.   Thanks so much.</p><p> BURGESS OWENS, AUTHOR, WHY I STAND:  Ho you doing, Lou?  Looking forward to  chatting with you my friend.</p><p> DOBBS:  And to you -- you know, it's just great to have you here.  I just  want to turn first to that game last night, these ratings for the NFL, no  one should start organizing a benefit for the NFL.  But my goodness, this  is just getting worse and worse.</p><p> OWENS:  Yes, well first of all, I didn't see the game.  I haven't really  seen a game for two years.  So, well, it comes down to it Lou, we have to  understand that this is -- this is on purpose.  We have an organization who  in the past was very patriotic.  We all remember the Al Davis days and Pete  Rozelle, we're now dealing with globalists.  </p><p> Then, there's two types by the way, there's the Republican and Democratic  globalist who care more about profits and patriotism and then, there's the  worst of the two as a leftist globalist who care about the socialist agenda  over patriotism.</p><p> We have an organization, it cares more about their international reach than  it care about the American brand and America -- and the American -- the NFL  fan.  These guys have already put in place 80 different countries, they  wanted they put into 200 like the Soccer League has.  It's all about T.V.  revenue.  They could care less about how full these stadiums are.  They get  their money and they share profits based on that T.V. revenue.  If they can  do in a global fashion, they'll be just like the soccer league with 200  countries tie-in no brand, no country brand but a global brand.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> OWENS:  And that's what their answer in the process of doing as they demean  our flag, demeaning our culture.  So, they will be accepted another place  like China and France and the other countries that are not so pro-American.</p><p> DOBBS:  As you -- as you put it and I have heard no one -- I mean, thank  you for that insight because frankly I hadn't considered that.  And I  suspect that lots of folks are just for the first time kind of wrapping  their heads around globalism its impact on the NFL.  And of course, that's  cumbersome.  I mean, we've seen it with this most recent movie about Neil  Armstrong and his -- you know, walking for the first time on the face of  the Moon.</p><p> OWENS:  Grab the flag.</p><p> DOBBS:  A great patriotic American, a great -- you, he was just an amazing  pilot, decorated.  He was just an amazing fellow.  And the American flag is  in front and center.  </p><p> And the -- and the reality is, you're right, the American flag becomes an  avatar for something that could maybe depress their global -- their global  expansion at the NFL.</p><p> OWENS:  Well, Lou, follow the money.  We have a commissioner who just  signed a contract with $40 million per year.  Only 10 percent of that for  me is guaranteed, the other 90 percent is based on his sentence.  Now,  understand, they've been dropping 20 percent, 13 percent of (INAUDIBLE)  last year, last couple years.  </p><p> But yet, then it capped -- or get capped out by the way 13 billion in the  United States.  We have to project in 27 billion in the next nine years  globally.</p><p> So, no, they don't care about America, they don't care about the American  fan who put them in place they are right now.  They're globalists and  globalist care more about their pocketbooks and their profits and the best  thing we can do is obviously not showing up is good thing but we need to  stop supporting their sponsors.  T.V. revenue is what gets into where they  are and now they share that equally, if we can we can hit them hard enough,  so that we hit them before they get their global things in place.  And  maybe they'll fire this commissioner and get somebody who cares about our  country about it -- about this brand and not trying to destroy.</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, that is a lot to consider.  Let me ask you this, do you  believe that there is within the NFL itself -- and I'm talking not to  management we know what the management is and the owners now.  There's no  more joke about what they'll -- they are.  But for the players, there  should be it seems to me, I hope that -- well, you could give me your  judgment, is there enough patriotism among those players to stand up for  the things that their fans care most about?  First the country in respect  for. </p><p> OWENS:  Well, this is why I'm glad that we have a president who drew a line  in the sand.  See what we're seeing on the field Lou, it's 20 years of  Marxist, socialist and atheists teaching our kids not to respect the flag,  not to say a prayer, not respect women or anything else.  So, these kids,  if you think about this, growing on for 20 years, 18, 20 years, hearing the  same anti-American, anti-white, anti-police.  They go stand on the  sidelines and believe that.  It doesn't matter what they have $20 million  in a pocketbook or one.  They're going to believe that because they've been  trained that.</p><p> We have around that field billions of dollars represented and not once have  they talked about collectively putting their funds together to start  businesses, how are these guys, these young men are not getting hired out  there educate our kids, our black kids that the left is not educating.  We  can do this within our own community if we understand we're up against.   This by the way, Americans do best.  We know we're in a fight and we're  going to fight right now.  It's our ideal Christian values against  Socialism, Marxism, atheism hates God.  And if we understand that,  understand what true evil is, then we'll stand up we'll win this fight.  We  need to start off at winning this particular midterm.  We need to push out  our American way further and not let the left do their deal.</p><p> DOBBS:  They're sure trying and you're absolutely right.  Burgess, thanks  for being with us.  Great to see you. </p><p> OWENS:  Thank you, Lou.  I appreciate it, buddy.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Burgess Owens, thank you, a great American.  Up next, Facebook  facing a massive fine for its latest major data breach but it's not the  United States concerned about just you know, married users.  You know, it's  at least according to well Silicon Valley.  We take it up with  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.  He's here next.  This is a big deal.   Stay with us, we'll be right back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  As I said, the President is speaking tonight at a rally in Johnson  City Tennessee.  He's there to support his Supreme Court two choice Judge  Brett Kavanaugh as well as Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn running for the  Senate.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he  was announced because they know the Judge Kavanaugh will follow the  Constitution as written.  They're trying to destroy a very fine person and  we can't let it happen. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  European -- the European Union looking into fining Facebook for  more than $1 billion after the recent cyber-attack, 50 million users' data  taken in that attack.  Ireland's data protection commission is demanding  more information from Facebook about the scale of the data theft and the  cyber-attack you -- in which you residents were victimized in the attack.   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the company takes the breach very  seriously.  </p><p> You would think they would take it seriously.  50 million people's personal  data stolen in a cyber-attack and Facebook still doesn't know who is behind  the hack and we haven't been really given too much information about the  timeline when the attack occurred, when Facebook found out, and how they  notified 50 million people. </p><p> Joining us tonight cyber-security expert Morgan Wright, when -- and it's  great to see you, Morgan.  Thanks for being with us.  </p><p> MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  You bet, Lou. </p><p> There is such arrogance on the part of these big tech firms, social media,  it's -- it is really repulsive to hear Zuckerberg billionaire saying their  -- Facebook is taking this seriously.  Really?  Really?  They have to say  that.  My gosh. </p><p> Well, you know what strikes more fear into the heart of Mark Zuckerberg  than Batman, the GDPR and Irish Data Protection Commission because now  they're going to hit these companies where it hurts the most and that's  financially.  These -- all these companies wanted to be global and I in  your last seven you're talking to Burgess about the globalism, we'll all  these companies wants it global -- </p><p> DOBBS:  That was a great point was it, Burgess, I mean he nailed that. </p><p> WRIGHT:  He nailed -- he nailed it.  And -- but you know what, that  translates now into the business environment.  All these companies want to  be global, well guess what, now you have to play the baseline becomes the  strictest set of rules that are out there and the people who have them are  the E.U.  And you know what, they've actually got teeth behind these rules  to where now the Data Protection Commission, the little -- this little  agency in Ireland now is going to bring Facebook to the E.U. and say show  us the information and we'll decide if we're going to find you $1.6 billion  or not. </p><p> DOBBS:  And meanwhile, we have the CEO of Google telling basically all of  Congress, go to hell.  I'll show up and well talk with you privately and  maybe we'll talk sometime later.  You've got the chair of Facebook saying  we're taking it seriously when obviously it's the opposite or 50 million  people wouldn't have their user data, their personal data stolen a cyber- attack by Facebook knows not who. </p><p> WRIGHT:  Well you know -- and Lou, the other thing too about this.  This  wasn't Facebook data.  The way Facebook works too is they have what they  call single sign-on which means that you can use Facebook now to sign into  up services.  So not only was Facebook affected but if you signed a three  or four other sides using your Facebook credentials, you might have or had  your information stolen from those sites as well.  So it's much bigger than  Facebook alone. </p><p> DOBBS:  Yes.  That's why I said user personal data because of that  potentiality.  I -- what is the -- you know, all we're going to hear now  from Silicon Valley no regulation, no accountability of any kind.  They are  spending a fortune to make certain that they remain monopolistic.  For  example, Google sending reportedly tens of billions of dollars to do so.   The other companies, I'm sure doing -- social media companies they're doing  the same.  What can be done to bring them under control and to protect the  rights of citizens?  By the way, they're citizens not just consumers that  we -- that we have to say that for the benefit of the titans of Silicon  Valley. </p><p> WRIGHT:  You know, recently I wrote an article for Hill talking exactly  about this and nutty knows what their consumer rights or their data  protection rights are except to the E.U.  But I'll tell you, Lou, the other  thing that I think is going to strike fear into the hearts of these guys is  a gentleman by the name of Tim Berners-Lee.  He was one who originally  created the World Wide Web that runs on the internet.  He's now saying it's  time to take back control of our data, take back from Google so he's  building a system.  And I've seen part of this now, it works like you  actually control and own your data, nobody else owns it but you still get  the same functionality.  So I think -- </p><p> DOBBS:  Should this start -- should this start with the FCC is  contemporaneously with Congress? </p><p> WRIGHT:  It needs to start somewhere because, Lou, usually it has three  phases.  There's litigation -- there's regulation legislation. </p><p> DOBBS:  Got you.  Morgan, always great to get your thoughts and your  insights.</p><p> WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p> DOBBS:  Morgan, appreciate it.  </p><p> WRIGHT:  Yes, sir. </p><p> DOBBS:  Up next, President Trump lays out what the upcoming Midterms mean  for him, for us, our country.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  This election is choice between a Republican Party that is building  our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  More from the President's rally in Tennessee -- </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, we're -- well, we have a new NAFTA agreement and it's the  USMCA for Canada and Mexico and President Trump crediting tariffs while  announcing the new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico.  The President  addressing that just moments ago from at a rally for Marsha Blackburn in  Johnson City, Tennessee.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We have two wonderful partners now.  Now, they're partners Mexico  and Canada and that's a good thing.  That's a good thing.  America is  winning again and America is being respected again because we are finally  putting America first.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  America first.  And a reminder to pre-order Burgess Owens' brand  new book.  Pre-order it.  The book Why I Stand: From Freedom to the Killing  Fields of Socialism.  It's out October 30th.  We recommend it highly.   Thanks for being with us.  Good night from New York.</p><p> LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  The Senate's top  Republican has a warning for Democrats, quit delaying, obstructing, and  resisting the confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

NFL ratings taking another hit as  Roger Goodell and the owners continue to do little in some cases absolutely  nothing to address the remaining anthem controversy that has fans  abandoning the sport in droves.</p><p>Retired player Burgess Owens joins us tonight to talk about what if  anything can be done to turn the NFL round and to restore proper respect  and regard for the very people who make it all possible, American fans.  We  begin with breaking news tonight.  The Senate Majority Leader, Senator  Mitch McConnell setting a time for the Senate to vote on Judge Brett  Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  The time for endless  delay and obstruction has come to a close.  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is  out of committee, we're considering it here on the floor and Mr. President  will be voting this week.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Senator McConnell's commitment to the President comes as we learn  that the FBI could, could wrap up its investigation into allegations  against Judge Kavanaugh by tomorrow.  Our other top stories, well, we'll  lead off with a big one.  President Trump tearing up NAFTA as promised,  announcing a historic trade deal with Canada and Mexico finally putting  America first.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of  fairness and reciprocity.  To me it is the most important word in trade  because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations, all over the  world and we're changing that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  By the way, the President, I want to point this out very quickly,  he's right about reciprocity as is often the case.  The President is the  first president in three decades to talk about reciprocity in a trade deal  with the United States.  It's extraordinary.  The President winning a major  concession with Canada, now easing restrictions on its dairy market,  allowing American farmers to export about half a billion dollars worth of  dairy products for the first time.</p><p>The agreement boosting the auto industry as well.  Requirements for 75  percent of auto content to be made in North America, up from 62 percent and  Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum remaining in place, a strategy he  says led to today's new continental trade agreement.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs,  that includes Congress, so please don't charge tariffs, without tariffs you  wouldn't be -- we wouldn't be standing here.  And we're totally prepared to  do that, if they don't negotiate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President's tough tactics on trade leading to a deal last week  with South Korea.  The European Union has come to the negotiating table.   As well, the United States and Japan have begun trade talks.  And India is  now also seeking a deal.  President Trump today saying China wants to talk,  \"very badly\", but the President also says it's too soon.  The Trump  administration just last week imposed tariffs on $200 billion of exports  from China to the United States.</p><p>Our first guest tonight with the president during the Rose Garden trade  announcement and joining us is Peter Navarro, assistant to the president,  director of Trade and Industrial Policy, the director of the White House  Trade Council.  Good to have you with us, Peter.  Let's turn first of all  first of all -- well, first of all, let's say congratulations to you, to  the Trumo White House, and to the President.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  One fine day  in America, one fine day in North America with this deal.  I always -- it  was just precious being on the stage with the President.  You know, he  keeps saying, are you going to get tired of winning?   It's been a great 10  days, I mean, deals with Japan, deals with South Korea.  </p><p>DOBBS:  -- almost two years -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAVARRO:  It's amazing.  This president is putting down a record that is  the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern  history.  It's just amazing.  We don't hear about it on the press.  But  this record is amazing.  The economy is amazing.  And the funny thing, Lou,  is that he always gets criticized for being too tough.  Don't do this,  don't try that.  And sure enough it works.  And it work like charm today  and it's a good deal for both Canada and Mexico.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, I got to say to you, I don't think the president is being  criticized that much anymore.  I think he's certainly being criticized, you  know, that part of the left, the national left-wing media, they're going to  keep the nonsense up, they don't understand economics.  They don't  understand politics, history or the national interests.  The President  schools them each day.  At some point you would think they would learn.</p><p>But as you watch the press today, you know, there's a group that it's not  worth the time.  You know, I look at this and I say this is terrific and  for Mexico and Canada, does want to remain in something he calls the USMCA,  the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement instead of NAFTA.  You know, I  love that because it doesn't imply something that it's not.  It's a trade  agreement, straightforward, simple, for everybody to understand.</p><p>It doesn't imply a North American Free Trade Agreement because it's not.   It is a reciprocal balanced trade agreement.  And secondly it doesn't imply  a North American Union, harmonization of borders and a coming together of  three nations into one massive, you know, central command, of course, led  by the elites.  So, I'm very -- I'm thrilled with what the President has  accomplished here.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  And really, it hits three points in the triangle.  For me, having  a deal that's going to make this hemisphere the regional manufacturing base  for the world, it's going to bring back our supply chain through tough  regional content rules and labor rules, that's number one.  We've got  modernization of the agreement so bring things in like digital trade and  biologics which didn't exist in 1994.</p><p>And farmers made out very, very well today.  Not just dairy, chicken, eggs,  other things.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, the Chinese who have been trying to run their propaganda  through the newspapers in the Midwest and, you know, various outlets will  be pleased to hear that.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, there was some pretty strong signals in the agreement as  well.  There's a strong provision there on currency and currency  manipulation.  And last week, Lou, this went unnoticed like so much of what  President Trump does.  There was an amazing statement -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, it doesn't go unnoticed here, Peter.  I don't know who you  are talking to, but this audience knows what he's doing.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Absolutely, Lou.  You've been on this for 20 years, and these  days -- </p><p>DOBBS:  So what is it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  What is it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>NAVARRO:  So last week Japan, Europe and the United States led by the  Ambassador Lighthizer issued a joint statement basically condemning the  practices of China with regard to forced technology transfer and these huge  nonmarket subsidies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  I think that's Great, peter, but I got to be really honest with  you.  I'm ready for the statement that they're not going to permit the  theft of intellectual property from this country ever again.  And that as  they continue intellectual property theft, there will be consequences.   We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars as you know.  I don't frankly  give a darn about a collegial multi-state agreement.</p><p>I want this country to stand up and insist that it not happen further.  I  don't care if it's part of an agreement.  The hell with the agreement.   It's our property.  It ought to stop.  It ought to stop now.  OK?</p><p>NAVARRO:  I will give you an amen to that, Lou.  And the President's  already imposed $250 billion worth of tariffs on China for stealing our  stuff.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I think that's wonderful.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  But this statement last week is important because it wasn't -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  I appreciate it, Peter.  We're out of time.  I do.  I'm thrilled  that the President has succeeded in this agreement.  This is a wonderful  achievement for the administration, for this presidency.  And for the  director of the trade council.  Congratulations, Peter.  Thanks so much and  --</p><p>NAVARRO:  Thank so much, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- we -- nobody watching you on this broadcast is tired of winning  at all.   Thanks.  Up next, the shameless national left-wing media using today's  historic trade deal announcement to berate President Trump about Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In a tweet this weekend, Mr. President, you said that  it's incorrect to say you are limiting the scope of the FBI investigation.  </p><p>TRUMP:  What does that have to do with trade?  I don't mind answering the  question, but, you know, I would like to do the trade question.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It has to do with the other headline in the news  which is the Kavanaugh nomination.  </p><p>TRUMP:  No.  But -- I know.  But how about talking about trade and then  we'll go to that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do have a question on the Kavanaugh thing when you  get back to it if you take that.  You will take that now?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No, no.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Well, the question --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You said the FBI should interview whoever they  believe is appropriate.  Does that include Julie Swetnick, the third  accuser?  And can you promise to release the full findings -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  Give me your question, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- after they finish the report, Mr. President?</p><p>TRUMP:  Give me a question, please.  Give her the mic, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you saying your White House has put no  limitations on -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  No.  My White House is doing whatever the Senators want.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  No, no.  You don't -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Who they should interview?  </p><p>TRUMP:  You don't understand what I'm saying.  You do understand, you just  don't want to report it that way.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President, you know, you wouldn't think there would be that  many people who call themselves journalists, professionals, who don't  understand about manners and respect for the President and the White House.   We'll take that up with Ed Rollins and Michael Goodwin.  Should the  President be putting up with this nonsense?  That's also part of the  message as we continue in just one moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A Senior Republican Senate source tells Fox News that the FBI's  investigation into Judge Kavanaugh could wrap up as early as tomorrow.   This after the President was asked at least -- are you ready?  -- 11  questions about the Kavanaugh investigation and this at a time when the  President has -- was seeking some kind of order dealing first with trade  and then -- and I have to say, there is no recognizable standard of conduct  in the White House for the President of the United States.  This is  outrageous.</p><p>And I'm -- and I'm saying this as a journalist.  I am just outraged.  The  President stated once again he backs the investigation, but he wants it  done according to the terms requested by the Senate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation, whatever that  means according to the Senators and the Republicans and the Republican  majority.  I want them to do that.  I want it to be comprehensive.  I  actually think it is a good thing for Judge Kavanaugh.  I think it's  actually a good thing, not a bad thing.  I think it's a good thing.  Now,  with that being said, I'd like it to go quickly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President's position is the same as when he called for it last  week.  But already the radical Dems are trying to -- well, they want to  change the direction.  They've made an agreement.  They've torn that one  up.  And now they want a new one, and they want to tell everybody what the  FBI should be looking into.  You know, all of the subjects and issues and  events that they didn't question Judge Kavanaugh about when they had the  opportunity.</p><p>And they didn't when they had the opportunity to do the same with Dr. Ford.   We wouldn't be in this position, had it not been for the tortured confused  soul of the two-face Senator from Arizona, Snowflake, Arizona, by the way,  Jeff Flake who said he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh without a  supplemental FBI investigation.  Flake admitting that he only called for  the investigation because of his failed Senatorial career.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could you have done this if you were running for  reelection?  </p><p>REP. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  No, not a chance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not a chance.</p><p>FLAKE:  No.  No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because politics has become too sharp?  Too partisan?  </p><p>FLAKE:  Yes.  There's no value to reaching across the aisle.  There's no  currency for that anymore.  There's no incentive.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Wait a minute.  All the Democratic Senators on that committee were  telling everybody this isn't a partisan moment.  Yet Senator Flake has  discovered something.  It is a partisan moment, a bitterly hostile vicious  partisan moment.  In fact, despite Flake's call for an investigation,  despite the radical Dems pushing for more and more and more, nothing will  ever be good enough for the left.</p><p>New York Congressman Nadler talk about the left.  He made it very clear no  matter what the FBI finds, Congressional Dems will not be satisfied.  They  will not stop their smear campaign against Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D), NEW YORK:  This has got to be thoroughly  investigated.  I hope the Senate will do so.  If he is on the Supreme  Court, and the Senate hasn't investigated, then I -- then the House will  have to. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't he eloquent?  The House will have to.  With only 36 days to  go, until the midterms, statements like Nadler's make it clear what the  radical left is and that the radical left will stop at nothing to undermine  President Trump's agenda and destroy a great American jurist and a great  American.  Well, joining us tonight, top strategist for Great America PAC,  former Reagan White House political director, Fox News Political Analyst,  Ed Rollins.</p><p>New York Post Columnist, Fox Business Contributor, Michael Goodwin.  Thank  you both for being here.  I have to ask you, watching those people in the  White House Press Corps, ignorantly behave as they have, what in the world  is going to turn that around because that is a way in which the national  left-wing media is confusing the President's message and they are forcing  the President to correct their ill-mannered disrespect.  </p><p>MICHAEL GOODWIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  It is remarkable to watch it  time and again.  I mean, it's not just the questions they ask, but the  argumentative tone.  They interrupt the President.  Never saw that before.   But only this president.  The good news is they don't seem to matter.  I  mean, his success is not dependent on their recognition of it.  I think the  people -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't it time for somebody in that communications department?  I  mean somebody, whoever it may be, to start laying down some basic protocols  and etiquette and just a baseline for just decent behavior? </p><p>GOODWIN:  I think they have tried.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They have tried?  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes, yes.  I mean, they have cut CNN out of certain meetings and  things like that.  The problem is, the media itself has now become so  radicalized that it used to be that the press corps would sort of police  its own behavior.  Now it is just we're all -- we're all together against  him, that's the mood.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Do you -- would you like one of these networks to try to perform,  Ed?  Without the President?  I mean, if the President of the United States  tells the communications people, anyone who interrupts me again, this has  got to be, you know, it's got to end somewhere.  CNN would -- could their  ratings go lower?  I can guarantee you they can go lower.  You stop Jim  Acosta from behaving as he does, acting out?  </p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, the bottom line he doesn't have to  deal with it that way.  You know, President Obama to his credit basically  always had four or five people he hand-picked he was going to call on.  He  didn't call on anybody else.  He didn't have to go out to this PAC like  this, we have a very important decision or announcement to make.</p><p>DOBBS:  So what's going on?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think -- I think the White House communications operation is  failing and our old friend Bill Shine he's got all of it.  Put a choke  collar on some of these people.  And the President stand up there and  perform.  </p><p>DOBBS:  I have never known Bill Shine to be a reticent force at an  organization.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he needs -- he needs to be.  He's got the job now and he  needs to basically create some discipline and not leave the President out  there vulnerable to this PAC.  The bottom line is he needs to stand out  there and make the announcements and not have the press there answering  questions.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.  I think that's one way around it.  You don't need to have a  press conference.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, the President enjoys it because he basically dribbles their  little -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROLLINS:  He loves to banter and punts back.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  -- the White House lawn.  But it's -- first of all, but this is  becoming extraordinary in the disrespect towards the President.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Absolutely, it is.</p><p>DOBBS:  They can't -- they can't compete with him intellectually.  They  have no knowledge base to deal with.  They have no idea what in many  instances there is no -- there is just no comparison with the president.   Simply put, if they all talked at once, it still wouldn't be a fair fight.   But at the same time, they are -- you know, it's a disturbance in the  atmosphere.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Who is going to control the agenda?  Are they going to talk about  what he -- they want to talk about what he -- they want to talk about even  what the President wants to talk about and the accomplishments that he's  made including today with this enormous treaty that no one thought he could  pull it off and he's pulled it off.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Oh, it's extraordinary.  Very quickly.  Let's go to a number of  things.  Bernie Sanders quote -- let's -- I would request you inform the  FBI you will not consider their work complete until blah, blah, blah, the  same nonsense from Mazie Hirono, the Senator from Hawaii, you know, the  bull flies every -- in every direction from these people.  Why is anyone --  you know, to his credit, Senator McConnell says the vote comes this week.   Good luck.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes, yes, yes.  And Grassley had a wonderful letter back at  Sanders who -- look, I think the problem -- the Democrats revealed their  hand too early and they made it clear.  So now they have no credibility.   When they have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Too early.  Let's remind everybody that Chuck Schumer, the senior  Senator from New York, you know, told everybody, declared he was going to  stop -- he would destroy this guy, the day his name was announced.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Twenty-three minutes after, I believe.  </p><p>DOBBS:  The day that his name was announced by the President for this post.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  If we learn the lesson on the value of these elections, if the  House goes Democrat, Jerry Nadler will be chairman of the Oversight  Committee.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, that's frightening.  Should be frankly, it's frightening  that he's there.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>DOBBS:  And Maxine Waters will be chairman of the financial banking  institutions.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that will be a move for Jamie Dimon.  He will have some fun  then, huh?</p><p>ROLLINS:  So, just -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, it's -- we're going to show everyone an ad right now, very  quickly, we would like to run the commercial that Ed's PAC, the Great  America PAC has just put out defending Judge Kavanaugh.  Let's roll that,  if we could, please.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SCHUMER:  Judge Kavanaugh, I will oppose him with everything I've got.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Democrats admitted they would do anything to stop  Judge Kavanaugh from the start.  Instead of protecting Dr. Ford, they use  her, leaking her story, when she asked to be anonymous.  Democrats don't  care about protecting women and they never have.  Democrats have just one  goal, expanding their power.  We must confirm Judge Kavanaugh and reject  the Democrat power grab.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Ed, I think you have put out a very powerful product there.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  It is a truthful ad.</p><p>DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All about power.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Michael, you get the last word.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  I was going to say to Ed, how do you really feel? </p><p>ROLLINS:  Feel as strongly as Schumer does on the other side.  This is a  great man.  He should be on this court.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Couldn't agree more.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Have we -- have we got unanimity here?  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Absolutely.  </p><p>DOBBS:  All right.  Let me bring the gavel down.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you, gentlemen, appreciate it.  Be sure to vote in our poll  tonight.  Now that the President has secured the fair reciprocal trade deal  with Canada and Mexico, economic growth is soaring.  Stocks are near record  highs.  So what happens now?  Do you think a single bit of naysaying on the  part of left-wing savants who work for the fake news will admit they were  completely wrong now and President Trump absolutely right?</p><p>Wow, I can't wait to hear from you on this one.  I was -- I was just  thinking of a couple of New York Times economics writers, Nobel Laureate  one of them.  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  Coming up next, a gift  to the Republican Party, Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama are championing  the Dems push to the radical left.  More on these -- well, these hungry  campaigners.  We will let you decide what they are hungry for.</p><p>Washington Times Columnist Tammy Bruce joins me here next.  We're coming  right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump talking tonight at a rally in Johnson City,  Tennessee where he is supporting a senator -- the Congresswoman Marsha  Blackburn who wants to be the senator from Tennessee.  Touting his new  trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And just today we made  history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job- killing disaster known as NAFTA, with a brand new U.S.-Mexico Canada.  We  added Canada, worked out great, trade agreement.  And we're calling it  USMCA, no more NAFTA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Straight forward.  Former President Barack Obama putting his name  behind -- are you ready?  260 radical Dems in the midterms.  His extensive  list includes self-described socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New  York, Andrew Gillum in Florida.  A reminder in his eight years as  President, Obama presided over the Democratic Party loss of 63 seats in the  House, 10 in the Senate, as well as the loss of 12 governorships losing  more than a thousand, thousand Democratic --Democrats in his mere eight  years in office.  </p><p>And if you needed more proof of just how desperate the Dems are, they're  providing it, rolling out failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now  to push their radical agenda.  Those are cheers you hear from Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Imagine being able to hold  this administration accountable and actually make progress when it comes to  affordable health care, the rights of immigrants and refugees.  The urgent  challenge of climate change and yes, I could go on and on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  As she so often does.  As promised it would be a blessing for the  Republican Party as it seems that Dems still don't get why President Trump  is in office and not Hillary Clinton. </p><p>Well, joining us now Tammy Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business  contributor.  Great to have you with us Tammy.</p><p>First, to listen to Obama, to listen to Clinton, there have to be  Democratic candidates all over the country just quivering with fear at the  impact.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, Hillary it sounds like  she's running to be President of the European Union, certainly not this  country, right?</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  I look, we made a statement 2016 and both Barack Obama and Hillary  Clinton could not convince the American people when we had no idea how  extraordinary Donald Trump really would be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Around nefarious the Democrats were.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, exactly.  Now, that we've learned, we've got these  investigations, we found out exact -- well, I mean, it's really the tip of  the iceberg what we've learned about them.  But the fact is, Barack Obama  destroyed the Democratic Party.  That's why he has these very strange  individuals that he is supporting.  It's still though all about him, he's  desperate to not be seen as a failure and so is Hillary Clinton.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's too far too late.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, this is both of their problems.  They never viewed the  country as the priority.</p><p>DOBBS:  So, all we have to do is give up a country.  A constitutional  republic --</p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- leave it in ashes so that --</p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- we can pretend we care about their legacies, my God.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, they never cared about, they still don't think about the  average American --</p><p>DOBBS:  No, they care about -- remember --</p><p>BRUCE:  That is Donald Trump's strength.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They've demonstrated again in the Judiciary Committee how much they  care about women.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, they said on a woman's legitimate concerns and pain they  said for six weeks, they acknowledge, they leaked it to the press despite  her request for confidentiality.  And you can't even hear a whisper in the  left-wing media about holding them accountable.  Dianne Feinstein, Cory  Booker the list goes on.</p><p>BRUCE:  Her own lawyers who were referred to her by Senator Feinstein.  We  now believe of course mislead Dr. Ford about what her options would be when  it came to talking with the committee that they would go to California.   She clearly testified that she was unaware of that offer effectively.  That  is the kind of thing that needs to be investigated and I believe that that  is what we're going to be doing now, when it comes to how this woman was  misled.</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, we're becoming an investigative country, aren't we?  The  American people are going to have to take a look at what's in full view and  make a determination.  The radical element of this party is this, they've  taken over the Democratic Party, their conduct.  I mean, Chuck Schumer was  in a bit shaded nuanced.</p><p>BRUCE:  Not at all.</p><p>DOBBS:  He said point-blank he was going to destroy the president's nominee  if he could and that's what they have tried to do.</p><p>BRUCE:  And they want to eliminate due process, they want you to be guilty  and trying to prove yourself innocent.  I said in a column months ago that  the Democratic Party is really now Antifa.  It is -- it is that radical  element that has moved forward looking to destroy things for revenge with  no plan for the future and no desire to govern.</p><p>DOBBS:  You think -- do you think Kavanaugh gets the confirmation?</p><p>BRUCE:  You know, it depends on what happens this week.  It's a shame we've  given them another week, but I think so, yes.  I think we'll have it.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Great to see you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next President Trump's patriotism stands tall over the NFL.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>DOBBS:  Despite a marquee matchup last night between the Baltimore Ravens  and Pittsburgh Steelers ratings for Sunday Night Football fell 10 percent  from the previous week.  The NFL's national game on CBS between the Saints  and Giants also the lowest rated national game of this young NFL season</p><p>Joining us tonight, former NFL player for the New York Jets and the Oakland  Raiders Burgess Owens, author of the new book Why I Stand: From Freedom to  the Killing Fields of Socialism.  Burgess, great to have you with us.   Thanks so much.</p><p>BURGESS OWENS, AUTHOR, WHY I STAND:  Ho you doing, Lou?  Looking forward to  chatting with you my friend.</p><p>DOBBS:  And to you -- you know, it's just great to have you here.  I just  want to turn first to that game last night, these ratings for the NFL, no  one should start organizing a benefit for the NFL.  But my goodness, this  is just getting worse and worse.</p><p>OWENS:  Yes, well first of all, I didn't see the game.  I haven't really  seen a game for two years.  So, well, it comes down to it Lou, we have to  understand that this is -- this is on purpose.  We have an organization who  in the past was very patriotic.  We all remember the Al Davis days and Pete  Rozelle, we're now dealing with globalists.  </p><p>Then, there's two types by the way, there's the Republican and Democratic  globalist who care more about profits and patriotism and then, there's the  worst of the two as a leftist globalist who care about the socialist agenda  over patriotism.</p><p>We have an organization, it cares more about their international reach than  it care about the American brand and America -- and the American -- the NFL  fan.  These guys have already put in place 80 different countries, they  wanted they put into 200 like the Soccer League has.  It's all about T.V.  revenue.  They could care less about how full these stadiums are.  They get  their money and they share profits based on that T.V. revenue.  If they can  do in a global fashion, they'll be just like the soccer league with 200  countries tie-in no brand, no country brand but a global brand.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>OWENS:  And that's what their answer in the process of doing as they demean  our flag, demeaning our culture.  So, they will be accepted another place  like China and France and the other countries that are not so pro-American.</p><p>DOBBS:  As you -- as you put it and I have heard no one -- I mean, thank  you for that insight because frankly I hadn't considered that.  And I  suspect that lots of folks are just for the first time kind of wrapping  their heads around globalism its impact on the NFL.  And of course, that's  cumbersome.  I mean, we've seen it with this most recent movie about Neil  Armstrong and his -- you know, walking for the first time on the face of  the Moon.</p><p>OWENS:  Grab the flag.</p><p>DOBBS:  A great patriotic American, a great -- you, he was just an amazing  pilot, decorated.  He was just an amazing fellow.  And the American flag is  in front and center.  </p><p>And the -- and the reality is, you're right, the American flag becomes an  avatar for something that could maybe depress their global -- their global  expansion at the NFL.</p><p>OWENS:  Well, Lou, follow the money.  We have a commissioner who just  signed a contract with $40 million per year.  Only 10 percent of that for  me is guaranteed, the other 90 percent is based on his sentence.  Now,  understand, they've been dropping 20 percent, 13 percent of (INAUDIBLE)  last year, last couple years.  </p><p>But yet, then it capped -- or get capped out by the way 13 billion in the  United States.  We have to project in 27 billion in the next nine years  globally.</p><p>So, no, they don't care about America, they don't care about the American  fan who put them in place they are right now.  They're globalists and  globalist care more about their pocketbooks and their profits and the best  thing we can do is obviously not showing up is good thing but we need to  stop supporting their sponsors.  T.V. revenue is what gets into where they  are and now they share that equally, if we can we can hit them hard enough,  so that we hit them before they get their global things in place.  And  maybe they'll fire this commissioner and get somebody who cares about our  country about it -- about this brand and not trying to destroy.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that is a lot to consider.  Let me ask you this, do you  believe that there is within the NFL itself -- and I'm talking not to  management we know what the management is and the owners now.  There's no  more joke about what they'll -- they are.  But for the players, there  should be it seems to me, I hope that -- well, you could give me your  judgment, is there enough patriotism among those players to stand up for  the things that their fans care most about?  First the country in respect  for. </p><p>OWENS:  Well, this is why I'm glad that we have a president who drew a line  in the sand.  See what we're seeing on the field Lou, it's 20 years of  Marxist, socialist and atheists teaching our kids not to respect the flag,  not to say a prayer, not respect women or anything else.  So, these kids,  if you think about this, growing on for 20 years, 18, 20 years, hearing the  same anti-American, anti-white, anti-police.  They go stand on the  sidelines and believe that.  It doesn't matter what they have $20 million  in a pocketbook or one.  They're going to believe that because they've been  trained that.</p><p>We have around that field billions of dollars represented and not once have  they talked about collectively putting their funds together to start  businesses, how are these guys, these young men are not getting hired out  there educate our kids, our black kids that the left is not educating.  We  can do this within our own community if we understand we're up against.   This by the way, Americans do best.  We know we're in a fight and we're  going to fight right now.  It's our ideal Christian values against  Socialism, Marxism, atheism hates God.  And if we understand that,  understand what true evil is, then we'll stand up we'll win this fight.  We  need to start off at winning this particular midterm.  We need to push out  our American way further and not let the left do their deal.</p><p>DOBBS:  They're sure trying and you're absolutely right.  Burgess, thanks  for being with us.  Great to see you. </p><p>OWENS:  Thank you, Lou.  I appreciate it, buddy.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Burgess Owens, thank you, a great American.  Up next, Facebook  facing a massive fine for its latest major data breach but it's not the  United States concerned about just you know, married users.  You know, it's  at least according to well Silicon Valley.  We take it up with  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.  He's here next.  This is a big deal.   Stay with us, we'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  As I said, the President is speaking tonight at a rally in Johnson  City Tennessee.  He's there to support his Supreme Court two choice Judge  Brett Kavanaugh as well as Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn running for the  Senate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he  was announced because they know the Judge Kavanaugh will follow the  Constitution as written.  They're trying to destroy a very fine person and  we can't let it happen. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  European -- the European Union looking into fining Facebook for  more than $1 billion after the recent cyber-attack, 50 million users' data  taken in that attack.  Ireland's data protection commission is demanding  more information from Facebook about the scale of the data theft and the  cyber-attack you -- in which you residents were victimized in the attack.   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the company takes the breach very  seriously.  </p><p>You would think they would take it seriously.  50 million people's personal  data stolen in a cyber-attack and Facebook still doesn't know who is behind  the hack and we haven't been really given too much information about the  timeline when the attack occurred, when Facebook found out, and how they  notified 50 million people. </p><p>Joining us tonight cyber-security expert Morgan Wright, when -- and it's  great to see you, Morgan.  Thanks for being with us.  </p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  You bet, Lou. </p><p>There is such arrogance on the part of these big tech firms, social media,  it's -- it is really repulsive to hear Zuckerberg billionaire saying their  -- Facebook is taking this seriously.  Really?  Really?  They have to say  that.  My gosh. </p><p>Well, you know what strikes more fear into the heart of Mark Zuckerberg  than Batman, the GDPR and Irish Data Protection Commission because now  they're going to hit these companies where it hurts the most and that's  financially.  These -- all these companies wanted to be global and I in  your last seven you're talking to Burgess about the globalism, we'll all  these companies wants it global -- </p><p>DOBBS:  That was a great point was it, Burgess, I mean he nailed that. </p><p>WRIGHT:  He nailed -- he nailed it.  And -- but you know what, that  translates now into the business environment.  All these companies want to  be global, well guess what, now you have to play the baseline becomes the  strictest set of rules that are out there and the people who have them are  the E.U.  And you know what, they've actually got teeth behind these rules  to where now the Data Protection Commission, the little -- this little  agency in Ireland now is going to bring Facebook to the E.U. and say show  us the information and we'll decide if we're going to find you $1.6 billion  or not. </p><p>DOBBS:  And meanwhile, we have the CEO of Google telling basically all of  Congress, go to hell.  I'll show up and well talk with you privately and  maybe we'll talk sometime later.  You've got the chair of Facebook saying  we're taking it seriously when obviously it's the opposite or 50 million  people wouldn't have their user data, their personal data stolen a cyber- attack by Facebook knows not who. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Well you know -- and Lou, the other thing too about this.  This  wasn't Facebook data.  The way Facebook works too is they have what they  call single sign-on which means that you can use Facebook now to sign into  up services.  So not only was Facebook affected but if you signed a three  or four other sides using your Facebook credentials, you might have or had  your information stolen from those sites as well.  So it's much bigger than  Facebook alone. </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  That's why I said user personal data because of that  potentiality.  I -- what is the -- you know, all we're going to hear now  from Silicon Valley no regulation, no accountability of any kind.  They are  spending a fortune to make certain that they remain monopolistic.  For  example, Google sending reportedly tens of billions of dollars to do so.   The other companies, I'm sure doing -- social media companies they're doing  the same.  What can be done to bring them under control and to protect the  rights of citizens?  By the way, they're citizens not just consumers that  we -- that we have to say that for the benefit of the titans of Silicon  Valley. </p><p>WRIGHT:  You know, recently I wrote an article for Hill talking exactly  about this and nutty knows what their consumer rights or their data  protection rights are except to the E.U.  But I'll tell you, Lou, the other  thing that I think is going to strike fear into the hearts of these guys is  a gentleman by the name of Tim Berners-Lee.  He was one who originally  created the World Wide Web that runs on the internet.  He's now saying it's  time to take back control of our data, take back from Google so he's  building a system.  And I've seen part of this now, it works like you  actually control and own your data, nobody else owns it but you still get  the same functionality.  So I think -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Should this start -- should this start with the FCC is  contemporaneously with Congress? </p><p>WRIGHT:  It needs to start somewhere because, Lou, usually it has three  phases.  There's litigation -- there's regulation legislation. </p><p>DOBBS:  Got you.  Morgan, always great to get your thoughts and your  insights.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, appreciate it.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, sir. </p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, President Trump lays out what the upcoming Midterms mean  for him, for us, our country.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  This election is choice between a Republican Party that is building  our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  More from the President's rally in Tennessee -- </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, we're -- well, we have a new NAFTA agreement and it's the  USMCA for Canada and Mexico and President Trump crediting tariffs while  announcing the new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico.  The President  addressing that just moments ago from at a rally for Marsha Blackburn in  Johnson City, Tennessee.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have two wonderful partners now.  Now, they're partners Mexico  and Canada and that's a good thing.  That's a good thing.  America is  winning again and America is being respected again because we are finally  putting America first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  America first.  And a reminder to pre-order Burgess Owens' brand  new book.  Pre-order it.  The book Why I Stand: From Freedom to the Killing  Fields of Socialism.  It's out October 30th.  We recommend it highly.   Thanks for being with us.  Good night from New York.</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  The Senate's top  Republican has a warning for Democrats, quit delaying, obstructing, and  resisting the confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Our top  stories, promise is kept.  President Trump eking a trade deal with Canada  and Mexico that does away with the job killing NAFTA replacing it with an  agreement that is fair and reciprocal, putting America first. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Once approved by Congress,  this new deal will be the most modern, up-to-date and balanced trade  agreement in the history of our country.  With the most advanced  protections for workers ever developed.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We'll take up the economic significance of President Trump's  historic agreement with the director of the White House Trade Counsel,  Peter Navarro.  Also the FBI's 7th, seven, that's seven, investigations of  Judge Brett Kavanaugh could conclude as early as tomorrow.  Radical Dimm  obstructionists are already criticizing the investigation, proving they  have no regard for either the truth, their pledges, and are only interested  in political results.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless  and outrageous tactics of the Democrat Party.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Republican Strategist Ed Rollins, New York Post Columnist, Michael  Goodwin here tonight to discuss the Supreme Court confirmation battle.  And  it is a battle to the death, it seems.  NFL ratings taking another hit as  Roger Goodell and the owners continue to do little in some cases absolutely  nothing to address the remaining anthem controversy that has fans  abandoning the sport in droves.</p><p>Retired player Burgess Owens joins us tonight to talk about what if  anything can be done to turn the NFL round and to restore proper respect  and regard for the very people who make it all possible, American fans.  We  begin with breaking news tonight.  The Senate Majority Leader, Senator  Mitch McConnell setting a time for the Senate to vote on Judge Brett  Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  The time for endless  delay and obstruction has come to a close.  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is  out of committee, we're considering it here on the floor and Mr. President  will be voting this week.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Senator McConnell's commitment to the President comes as we learn  that the FBI could, could wrap up its investigation into allegations  against Judge Kavanaugh by tomorrow.  Our other top stories, well, we'll  lead off with a big one.  President Trump tearing up NAFTA as promised,  announcing a historic trade deal with Canada and Mexico finally putting  America first.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of  fairness and reciprocity.  To me it is the most important word in trade  because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations, all over the  world and we're changing that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  By the way, the President, I want to point this out very quickly,  he's right about reciprocity as is often the case.  The President is the  first president in three decades to talk about reciprocity in a trade deal  with the United States.  It's extraordinary.  The President winning a major  concession with Canada, now easing restrictions on its dairy market,  allowing American farmers to export about half a billion dollars worth of  dairy products for the first time.</p><p>The agreement boosting the auto industry as well.  Requirements for 75  percent of auto content to be made in North America, up from 62 percent and  Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum remaining in place, a strategy he  says led to today's new continental trade agreement.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs,  that includes Congress, so please don't charge tariffs, without tariffs you  wouldn't be -- we wouldn't be standing here.  And we're totally prepared to  do that, if they don't negotiate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President's tough tactics on trade leading to a deal last week  with South Korea.  The European Union has come to the negotiating table.   As well, the United States and Japan have begun trade talks.  And India is  now also seeking a deal.  President Trump today saying China wants to talk,  \"very badly\", but the President also says it's too soon.  The Trump  administration just last week imposed tariffs on $200 billion of exports  from China to the United States.</p><p>Our first guest tonight with the president during the Rose Garden trade  announcement and joining us is Peter Navarro, assistant to the president,  director of Trade and Industrial Policy, the director of the White House  Trade Council.  Good to have you with us, Peter.  Let's turn first of all  first of all -- well, first of all, let's say congratulations to you, to  the Trumo White House, and to the President.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  One fine day  in America, one fine day in North America with this deal.  I always -- it  was just precious being on the stage with the President.  You know, he  keeps saying, are you going to get tired of winning?   It's been a great 10  days, I mean, deals with Japan, deals with South Korea.  </p><p>DOBBS:  -- almost two years -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAVARRO:  It's amazing.  This president is putting down a record that is  the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern  history.  It's just amazing.  We don't hear about it on the press.  But  this record is amazing.  The economy is amazing.  And the funny thing, Lou,  is that he always gets criticized for being too tough.  Don't do this,  don't try that.  And sure enough it works.  And it work like charm today  and it's a good deal for both Canada and Mexico.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, I got to say to you, I don't think the president is being  criticized that much anymore.  I think he's certainly being criticized, you  know, that part of the left, the national left-wing media, they're going to  keep the nonsense up, they don't understand economics.  They don't  understand politics, history or the national interests.  The President  schools them each day.  At some point you would think they would learn.</p><p>But as you watch the press today, you know, there's a group that it's not  worth the time.  You know, I look at this and I say this is terrific and  for Mexico and Canada, does want to remain in something he calls the USMCA,  the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement instead of NAFTA.  You know, I  love that because it doesn't imply something that it's not.  It's a trade  agreement, straightforward, simple, for everybody to understand.</p><p>It doesn't imply a North American Free Trade Agreement because it's not.   It is a reciprocal balanced trade agreement.  And secondly it doesn't imply  a North American Union, harmonization of borders and a coming together of  three nations into one massive, you know, central command, of course, led  by the elites.  So, I'm very -- I'm thrilled with what the President has  accomplished here.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  And really, it hits three points in the triangle.  For me, having  a deal that's going to make this hemisphere the regional manufacturing base  for the world, it's going to bring back our supply chain through tough  regional content rules and labor rules, that's number one.  We've got  modernization of the agreement so bring things in like digital trade and  biologics which didn't exist in 1994.</p><p>And farmers made out very, very well today.  Not just dairy, chicken, eggs,  other things.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, the Chinese who have been trying to run their propaganda  through the newspapers in the Midwest and, you know, various outlets will  be pleased to hear that.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, there was some pretty strong signals in the agreement as  well.  There's a strong provision there on currency and currency  manipulation.  And last week, Lou, this went unnoticed like so much of what  President Trump does.  There was an amazing statement -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, it doesn't go unnoticed here, Peter.  I don't know who you  are talking to, but this audience knows what he's doing.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Absolutely, Lou.  You've been on this for 20 years, and these  days -- </p><p>DOBBS:  So what is it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  What is it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>NAVARRO:  So last week Japan, Europe and the United States led by the  Ambassador Lighthizer issued a joint statement basically condemning the  practices of China with regard to forced technology transfer and these huge  nonmarket subsidies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  I think that's Great, peter, but I got to be really honest with  you.  I'm ready for the statement that they're not going to permit the  theft of intellectual property from this country ever again.  And that as  they continue intellectual property theft, there will be consequences.   We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars as you know.  I don't frankly  give a darn about a collegial multi-state agreement.</p><p>I want this country to stand up and insist that it not happen further.  I  don't care if it's part of an agreement.  The hell with the agreement.   It's our property.  It ought to stop.  It ought to stop now.  OK?</p><p>NAVARRO:  I will give you an amen to that, Lou.  And the President's  already imposed $250 billion worth of tariffs on China for stealing our  stuff.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I think that's wonderful.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  But this statement last week is important because it wasn't -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  I appreciate it, Peter.  We're out of time.  I do.  I'm thrilled  that the President has succeeded in this agreement.  This is a wonderful  achievement for the administration, for this presidency.  And for the  director of the trade council.  Congratulations, Peter.  Thanks so much and  --</p><p>NAVARRO:  Thank so much, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- we -- nobody watching you on this broadcast is tired of winning  at all.   Thanks.  Up next, the shameless national left-wing media using today's  historic trade deal announcement to berate President Trump about Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In a tweet this weekend, Mr. President, you said that  it's incorrect to say you are limiting the scope of the FBI investigation.  </p><p>TRUMP:  What does that have to do with trade?  I don't mind answering the  question, but, you know, I would like to do the trade question.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It has to do with the other headline in the news  which is the Kavanaugh nomination.  </p><p>TRUMP:  No.  But -- I know.  But how about talking about trade and then  we'll go to that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do have a question on the Kavanaugh thing when you  get back to it if you take that.  You will take that now?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No, no.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Well, the question --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You said the FBI should interview whoever they  believe is appropriate.  Does that include Julie Swetnick, the third  accuser?  And can you promise to release the full findings -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  Give me your question, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- after they finish the report, Mr. President?</p><p>TRUMP:  Give me a question, please.  Give her the mic, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you saying your White House has put no  limitations on -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  No.  My White House is doing whatever the Senators want.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  No, no.  You don't -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Who they should interview?  </p><p>TRUMP:  You don't understand what I'm saying.  You do understand, you just  don't want to report it that way.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President, you know, you wouldn't think there would be that  many people who call themselves journalists, professionals, who don't  understand about manners and respect for the President and the White House.   We'll take that up with Ed Rollins and Michael Goodwin.  Should the  President be putting up with this nonsense?  That's also part of the  message as we continue in just one moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A Senior Republican Senate source tells Fox News that the FBI's  investigation into Judge Kavanaugh could wrap up as early as tomorrow.   This after the President was asked at least -- are you ready?  -- 11  questions about the Kavanaugh investigation and this at a time when the  President has -- was seeking some kind of order dealing first with trade  and then -- and I have to say, there is no recognizable standard of conduct  in the White House for the President of the United States.  This is  outrageous.</p><p>And I'm -- and I'm saying this as a journalist.  I am just outraged.  The  President stated once again he backs the investigation, but he wants it  done according to the terms requested by the Senate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation, whatever that  means according to the Senators and the Republicans and the Republican  majority.  I want them to do that.  I want it to be comprehensive.  I  actually think it is a good thing for Judge Kavanaugh.  I think it's  actually a good thing, not a bad thing.  I think it's a good thing.  Now,  with that being said, I'd like it to go quickly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President's position is the same as when he called for it last  week.  But already the radical Dems are trying to -- well, they want to  change the direction.  They've made an agreement.  They've torn that one  up.  And now they want a new one, and they want to tell everybody what the  FBI should be looking into.  You know, all of the subjects and issues and  events that they didn't question Judge Kavanaugh about when they had the  opportunity.</p><p>And they didn't when they had the opportunity to do the same with Dr. Ford.   We wouldn't be in this position, had it not been for the tortured confused  soul of the two-face Senator from Arizona, Snowflake, Arizona, by the way,  Jeff Flake who said he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh without a  supplemental FBI investigation.  Flake admitting that he only called for  the investigation because of his failed Senatorial career.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could you have done this if you were running for  reelection?  </p><p>REP. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  No, not a chance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not a chance.</p><p>FLAKE:  No.  No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because politics has become too sharp?  Too partisan?  </p><p>FLAKE:  Yes.  There's no value to reaching across the aisle.  There's no  currency for that anymore.  There's no incentive.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Wait a minute.  All the Democratic Senators on that committee were  telling everybody this isn't a partisan moment.  Yet Senator Flake has  discovered something.  It is a partisan moment, a bitterly hostile vicious  partisan moment.  In fact, despite Flake's call for an investigation,  despite the radical Dems pushing for more and more and more, nothing will  ever be good enough for the left.</p><p>New York Congressman Nadler talk about the left.  He made it very clear no  matter what the FBI finds, Congressional Dems will not be satisfied.  They  will not stop their smear campaign against Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D), NEW YORK:  This has got to be thoroughly  investigated.  I hope the Senate will do so.  If he is on the Supreme  Court, and the Senate hasn't investigated, then I -- then the House will  have to. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't he eloquent?  The House will have to.  With only 36 days to  go, until the midterms, statements like Nadler's make it clear what the  radical left is and that the radical left will stop at nothing to undermine  President Trump's agenda and destroy a great American jurist and a great  American.  Well, joining us tonight, top strategist for Great America PAC,  former Reagan White House political director, Fox News Political Analyst,  Ed Rollins.</p><p>New York Post Columnist, Fox Business Contributor, Michael Goodwin.  Thank  you both for being here.  I have to ask you, watching those people in the  White House Press Corps, ignorantly behave as they have, what in the world  is going to turn that around because that is a way in which the national  left-wing media is confusing the President's message and they are forcing  the President to correct their ill-mannered disrespect.  </p><p>MICHAEL GOODWIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  It is remarkable to watch it  time and again.  I mean, it's not just the questions they ask, but the  argumentative tone.  They interrupt the President.  Never saw that before.   But only this president.  The good news is they don't seem to matter.  I  mean, his success is not dependent on their recognition of it.  I think the  people -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't it time for somebody in that communications department?  I  mean somebody, whoever it may be, to start laying down some basic protocols  and etiquette and just a baseline for just decent behavior? </p><p>GOODWIN:  I think they have tried.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They have tried?  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes, yes.  I mean, they have cut CNN out of certain meetings and  things like that.  The problem is, the media itself has now become so  radicalized that it used to be that the press corps would sort of police  its own behavior.  Now it is just we're all -- we're all together against  him, that's the mood.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Do you -- would you like one of these networks to try to perform,  Ed?  Without the President?  I mean, if the President of the United States  tells the communications people, anyone who interrupts me again, this has  got to be, you know, it's got to end somewhere.  CNN would -- could their  ratings go lower?  I can guarantee you they can go lower.  You stop Jim  Acosta from behaving as he does, acting out?  </p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, the bottom line he doesn't have to  deal with it that way.  You know, President Obama to his credit basically  always had four or five people he hand-picked he was going to call on.  He  didn't call on anybody else.  He didn't have to go out to this PAC like  this, we have a very important decision or announcement to make.</p><p>DOBBS:  So what's going on?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think -- I think the White House communications operation is  failing and our old friend Bill Shine he's got all of it.  Put a choke  collar on some of these people.  And the President stand up there and  perform.  </p><p>DOBBS:  I have never known Bill Shine to be a reticent force at an  organization.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he needs -- he needs to be.  He's got the job now and he  needs to basically create some discipline and not leave the President out  there vulnerable to this PAC.  The bottom line is he needs to stand out  there and make the announcements and not have the press there answering  questions.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.  I think that's one way around it.  You don't need to have a  press conference.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, the President enjoys it because he basically dribbles their  little -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROLLINS:  He loves to banter and punts back.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  -- the White House lawn.  But it's -- first of all, but this is  becoming extraordinary in the disrespect towards the President.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Absolutely, it is.</p><p>DOBBS:  They can't -- they can't compete with him intellectually.  They  have no knowledge base to deal with.  They have no idea what in many  instances there is no -- there is just no comparison with the president.   Simply put, if they all talked at once, it still wouldn't be a fair fight.   But at the same time, they are -- you know, it's a disturbance in the  atmosphere.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Who is going to control the agenda?  Are they going to talk about  what he -- they want to talk about what he -- they want to talk about even  what the President wants to talk about and the accomplishments that he's  made including today with this enormous treaty that no one thought he could  pull it off and he's pulled it off.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Oh, it's extraordinary.  Very quickly.  Let's go to a number of  things.  Bernie Sanders quote -- let's -- I would request you inform the  FBI you will not consider their work complete until blah, blah, blah, the  same nonsense from Mazie Hirono, the Senator from Hawaii, you know, the  bull flies every -- in every direction from these people.  Why is anyone --  you know, to his credit, Senator McConnell says the vote comes this week.   Good luck.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes, yes, yes.  And Grassley had a wonderful letter back at  Sanders who -- look, I think the problem -- the Democrats revealed their  hand too early and they made it clear.  So now they have no credibility.   When they have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Too early.  Let's remind everybody that Chuck Schumer, the senior  Senator from New York, you know, told everybody, declared he was going to  stop -- he would destroy this guy, the day his name was announced.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Twenty-three minutes after, I believe.  </p><p>DOBBS:  The day that his name was announced by the President for this post.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  If we learn the lesson on the value of these elections, if the  House goes Democrat, Jerry Nadler will be chairman of the Oversight  Committee.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, that's frightening.  Should be frankly, it's frightening  that he's there.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>DOBBS:  And Maxine Waters will be chairman of the financial banking  institutions.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that will be a move for Jamie Dimon.  He will have some fun  then, huh?</p><p>ROLLINS:  So, just -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, it's -- we're going to show everyone an ad right now, very  quickly, we would like to run the commercial that Ed's PAC, the Great  America PAC has just put out defending Judge Kavanaugh.  Let's roll that,  if we could, please.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SCHUMER:  Judge Kavanaugh, I will oppose him with everything I've got.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Democrats admitted they would do anything to stop  Judge Kavanaugh from the start.  Instead of protecting Dr. Ford, they use  her, leaking her story, when she asked to be anonymous.  Democrats don't  care about protecting women and they never have.  Democrats have just one  goal, expanding their power.  We must confirm Judge Kavanaugh and reject  the Democrat power grab.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Ed, I think you have put out a very powerful product there.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  It is a truthful ad.</p><p>DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All about power.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Michael, you get the last word.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  I was going to say to Ed, how do you really feel? </p><p>ROLLINS:  Feel as strongly as Schumer does on the other side.  This is a  great man.  He should be on this court.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Couldn't agree more.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Have we -- have we got unanimity here?  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Absolutely.  </p><p>DOBBS:  All right.  Let me bring the gavel down.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you, gentlemen, appreciate it.  Be sure to vote in our poll  tonight.  Now that the President has secured the fair reciprocal trade deal  with Canada and Mexico, economic growth is soaring.  Stocks are near record  highs.  So what happens now?  Do you think a single bit of naysaying on the  part of left-wing savants who work for the fake news will admit they were  completely wrong now and President Trump absolutely right?</p><p>Wow, I can't wait to hear from you on this one.  I was -- I was just  thinking of a couple of New York Times economics writers, Nobel Laureate  one of them.  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  Coming up next, a gift  to the Republican Party, Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama are championing  the Dems push to the radical left.  More on these -- well, these hungry  campaigners.  We will let you decide what they are hungry for.</p><p>Washington Times Columnist Tammy Bruce joins me here next.  We're coming  right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump talking tonight at a rally in Johnson City,  Tennessee where he is supporting a senator -- the Congresswoman Marsha  Blackburn who wants to be the senator from Tennessee.  Touting his new  trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And just today we made  history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job- killing disaster known as NAFTA, with a brand new U.S.-Mexico Canada.  We  added Canada, worked out great, trade agreement.  And we're calling it  USMCA, no more NAFTA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Straight forward.  Former President Barack Obama putting his name  behind -- are you ready?  260 radical Dems in the midterms.  His extensive  list includes self-described socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New  York, Andrew Gillum in Florida.  A reminder in his eight years as  President, Obama presided over the Democratic Party loss of 63 seats in the  House, 10 in the Senate, as well as the loss of 12 governorships losing  more than a thousand, thousand Democratic --Democrats in his mere eight  years in office.  </p><p>And if you needed more proof of just how desperate the Dems are, they're  providing it, rolling out failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now  to push their radical agenda.  Those are cheers you hear from Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Imagine being able to hold  this administration accountable and actually make progress when it comes to  affordable health care, the rights of immigrants and refugees.  The urgent  challenge of climate change and yes, I could go on and on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  As she so often does.  As promised it would be a blessing for the  Republican Party as it seems that Dems still don't get why President Trump  is in office and not Hillary Clinton. </p><p>Well, joining us now Tammy Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business  contributor.  Great to have you with us Tammy.</p><p>First, to listen to Obama, to listen to Clinton, there have to be  Democratic candidates all over the country just quivering with fear at the  impact.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, Hillary it sounds like  she's running to be President of the European Union, certainly not this  country, right?</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  I look, we made a statement 2016 and both Barack Obama and Hillary  Clinton could not convince the American people when we had no idea how  extraordinary Donald Trump really would be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Around nefarious the Democrats were.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, exactly.  Now, that we've learned, we've got these  investigations, we found out exact -- well, I mean, it's really the tip of  the iceberg what we've learned about them.  But the fact is, Barack Obama  destroyed the Democratic Party.  That's why he has these very strange  individuals that he is supporting.  It's still though all about him, he's  desperate to not be seen as a failure and so is Hillary Clinton.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's too far too late.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, this is both of their problems.  They never viewed the  country as the priority.</p><p>DOBBS:  So, all we have to do is give up a country.  A constitutional  republic --</p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- leave it in ashes so that --</p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- we can pretend we care about their legacies, my God.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, they never cared about, they still don't think about the  average American --</p><p>DOBBS:  No, they care about -- remember --</p><p>BRUCE:  That is Donald Trump's strength.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They've demonstrated again in the Judiciary Committee how much they  care about women.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, they said on a woman's legitimate concerns and pain they  said for six weeks, they acknowledge, they leaked it to the press despite  her request for confidentiality.  And you can't even hear a whisper in the  left-wing media about holding them accountable.  Dianne Feinstein, Cory  Booker the list goes on.</p><p>BRUCE:  Her own lawyers who were referred to her by Senator Feinstein.  We  now believe of course mislead Dr. Ford about what her options would be when  it came to talking with the committee that they would go to California.   She clearly testified that she was unaware of that offer effectively.  That  is the kind of thing that needs to be investigated and I believe that that  is what we're going to be doing now, when it comes to how this woman was  misled.</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, we're becoming an investigative country, aren't we?  The  American people are going to have to take a look at what's in full view and  make a determination.  The radical element of this party is this, they've  taken over the Democratic Party, their conduct.  I mean, Chuck Schumer was  in a bit shaded nuanced.</p><p>BRUCE:  Not at all.</p><p>DOBBS:  He said point-blank he was going to destroy the president's nominee  if he could and that's what they have tried to do.</p><p>BRUCE:  And they want to eliminate due process, they want you to be guilty  and trying to prove yourself innocent.  I said in a column months ago that  the Democratic Party is really now Antifa.  It is -- it is that radical  element that has moved forward looking to destroy things for revenge with  no plan for the future and no desire to govern.</p><p>DOBBS:  You think -- do you think Kavanaugh gets the confirmation?</p><p>BRUCE:  You know, it depends on what happens this week.  It's a shame we've  given them another week, but I think so, yes.  I think we'll have it.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Great to see you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next President Trump's patriotism stands tall over the NFL.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>DOBBS:  Despite a marquee matchup last night between the Baltimore Ravens  and Pittsburgh Steelers ratings for Sunday Night Football fell 10 percent  from the previous week.  The NFL's national game on CBS between the Saints  and Giants also the lowest rated national game of this young NFL season</p><p>Joining us tonight, former NFL player for the New York Jets and the Oakland  Raiders Burgess Owens, author of the new book Why I Stand: From Freedom to  the Killing Fields of Socialism.  Burgess, great to have you with us.   Thanks so much.</p><p>BURGESS OWENS, AUTHOR, WHY I STAND:  Ho you doing, Lou?  Looking forward to  chatting with you my friend.</p><p>DOBBS:  And to you -- you know, it's just great to have you here.  I just  want to turn first to that game last night, these ratings for the NFL, no  one should start organizing a benefit for the NFL.  But my goodness, this  is just getting worse and worse.</p><p>OWENS:  Yes, well first of all, I didn't see the game.  I haven't really  seen a game for two years.  So, well, it comes down to it Lou, we have to  understand that this is -- this is on purpose.  We have an organization who  in the past was very patriotic.  We all remember the Al Davis days and Pete  Rozelle, we're now dealing with globalists.  </p><p>Then, there's two types by the way, there's the Republican and Democratic  globalist who care more about profits and patriotism and then, there's the  worst of the two as a leftist globalist who care about the socialist agenda  over patriotism.</p><p>We have an organization, it cares more about their international reach than  it care about the American brand and America -- and the American -- the NFL  fan.  These guys have already put in place 80 different countries, they  wanted they put into 200 like the Soccer League has.  It's all about T.V.  revenue.  They could care less about how full these stadiums are.  They get  their money and they share profits based on that T.V. revenue.  If they can  do in a global fashion, they'll be just like the soccer league with 200  countries tie-in no brand, no country brand but a global brand.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>OWENS:  And that's what their answer in the process of doing as they demean  our flag, demeaning our culture.  So, they will be accepted another place  like China and France and the other countries that are not so pro-American.</p><p>DOBBS:  As you -- as you put it and I have heard no one -- I mean, thank  you for that insight because frankly I hadn't considered that.  And I  suspect that lots of folks are just for the first time kind of wrapping  their heads around globalism its impact on the NFL.  And of course, that's  cumbersome.  I mean, we've seen it with this most recent movie about Neil  Armstrong and his -- you know, walking for the first time on the face of  the Moon.</p><p>OWENS:  Grab the flag.</p><p>DOBBS:  A great patriotic American, a great -- you, he was just an amazing  pilot, decorated.  He was just an amazing fellow.  And the American flag is  in front and center.  </p><p>And the -- and the reality is, you're right, the American flag becomes an  avatar for something that could maybe depress their global -- their global  expansion at the NFL.</p><p>OWENS:  Well, Lou, follow the money.  We have a commissioner who just  signed a contract with $40 million per year.  Only 10 percent of that for  me is guaranteed, the other 90 percent is based on his sentence.  Now,  understand, they've been dropping 20 percent, 13 percent of (INAUDIBLE)  last year, last couple years.  </p><p>But yet, then it capped -- or get capped out by the way 13 billion in the  United States.  We have to project in 27 billion in the next nine years  globally.</p><p>So, no, they don't care about America, they don't care about the American  fan who put them in place they are right now.  They're globalists and  globalist care more about their pocketbooks and their profits and the best  thing we can do is obviously not showing up is good thing but we need to  stop supporting their sponsors.  T.V. revenue is what gets into where they  are and now they share that equally, if we can we can hit them hard enough,  so that we hit them before they get their global things in place.  And  maybe they'll fire this commissioner and get somebody who cares about our  country about it -- about this brand and not trying to destroy.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that is a lot to consider.  Let me ask you this, do you  believe that there is within the NFL itself -- and I'm talking not to  management we know what the management is and the owners now.  There's no  more joke about what they'll -- they are.  But for the players, there  should be it seems to me, I hope that -- well, you could give me your  judgment, is there enough patriotism among those players to stand up for  the things that their fans care most about?  First the country in respect  for. </p><p>OWENS:  Well, this is why I'm glad that we have a president who drew a line  in the sand.  See what we're seeing on the field Lou, it's 20 years of  Marxist, socialist and atheists teaching our kids not to respect the flag,  not to say a prayer, not respect women or anything else.  So, these kids,  if you think about this, growing on for 20 years, 18, 20 years, hearing the  same anti-American, anti-white, anti-police.  They go stand on the  sidelines and believe that.  It doesn't matter what they have $20 million  in a pocketbook or one.  They're going to believe that because they've been  trained that.</p><p>We have around that field billions of dollars represented and not once have  they talked about collectively putting their funds together to start  businesses, how are these guys, these young men are not getting hired out  there educate our kids, our black kids that the left is not educating.  We  can do this within our own community if we understand we're up against.   This by the way, Americans do best.  We know we're in a fight and we're  going to fight right now.  It's our ideal Christian values against  Socialism, Marxism, atheism hates God.  And if we understand that,  understand what true evil is, then we'll stand up we'll win this fight.  We  need to start off at winning this particular midterm.  We need to push out  our American way further and not let the left do their deal.</p><p>DOBBS:  They're sure trying and you're absolutely right.  Burgess, thanks  for being with us.  Great to see you. </p><p>OWENS:  Thank you, Lou.  I appreciate it, buddy.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Burgess Owens, thank you, a great American.  Up next, Facebook  facing a massive fine for its latest major data breach but it's not the  United States concerned about just you know, married users.  You know, it's  at least according to well Silicon Valley.  We take it up with  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.  He's here next.  This is a big deal.   Stay with us, we'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  As I said, the President is speaking tonight at a rally in Johnson  City Tennessee.  He's there to support his Supreme Court two choice Judge  Brett Kavanaugh as well as Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn running for the  Senate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he  was announced because they know the Judge Kavanaugh will follow the  Constitution as written.  They're trying to destroy a very fine person and  we can't let it happen. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  European -- the European Union looking into fining Facebook for  more than $1 billion after the recent cyber-attack, 50 million users' data  taken in that attack.  Ireland's data protection commission is demanding  more information from Facebook about the scale of the data theft and the  cyber-attack you -- in which you residents were victimized in the attack.   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the company takes the breach very  seriously.  </p><p>You would think they would take it seriously.  50 million people's personal  data stolen in a cyber-attack and Facebook still doesn't know who is behind  the hack and we haven't been really given too much information about the  timeline when the attack occurred, when Facebook found out, and how they  notified 50 million people. </p><p>Joining us tonight cyber-security expert Morgan Wright, when -- and it's  great to see you, Morgan.  Thanks for being with us.  </p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  You bet, Lou. </p><p>There is such arrogance on the part of these big tech firms, social media,  it's -- it is really repulsive to hear Zuckerberg billionaire saying their  -- Facebook is taking this seriously.  Really?  Really?  They have to say  that.  My gosh. </p><p>Well, you know what strikes more fear into the heart of Mark Zuckerberg  than Batman, the GDPR and Irish Data Protection Commission because now  they're going to hit these companies where it hurts the most and that's  financially.  These -- all these companies wanted to be global and I in  your last seven you're talking to Burgess about the globalism, we'll all  these companies wants it global -- </p><p>DOBBS:  That was a great point was it, Burgess, I mean he nailed that. </p><p>WRIGHT:  He nailed -- he nailed it.  And -- but you know what, that  translates now into the business environment.  All these companies want to  be global, well guess what, now you have to play the baseline becomes the  strictest set of rules that are out there and the people who have them are  the E.U.  And you know what, they've actually got teeth behind these rules  to where now the Data Protection Commission, the little -- this little  agency in Ireland now is going to bring Facebook to the E.U. and say show  us the information and we'll decide if we're going to find you $1.6 billion  or not. </p><p>DOBBS:  And meanwhile, we have the CEO of Google telling basically all of  Congress, go to hell.  I'll show up and well talk with you privately and  maybe we'll talk sometime later.  You've got the chair of Facebook saying  we're taking it seriously when obviously it's the opposite or 50 million  people wouldn't have their user data, their personal data stolen a cyber- attack by Facebook knows not who. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Well you know -- and Lou, the other thing too about this.  This  wasn't Facebook data.  The way Facebook works too is they have what they  call single sign-on which means that you can use Facebook now to sign into  up services.  So not only was Facebook affected but if you signed a three  or four other sides using your Facebook credentials, you might have or had  your information stolen from those sites as well.  So it's much bigger than  Facebook alone. </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  That's why I said user personal data because of that  potentiality.  I -- what is the -- you know, all we're going to hear now  from Silicon Valley no regulation, no accountability of any kind.  They are  spending a fortune to make certain that they remain monopolistic.  For  example, Google sending reportedly tens of billions of dollars to do so.   The other companies, I'm sure doing -- social media companies they're doing  the same.  What can be done to bring them under control and to protect the  rights of citizens?  By the way, they're citizens not just consumers that  we -- that we have to say that for the benefit of the titans of Silicon  Valley. </p><p>WRIGHT:  You know, recently I wrote an article for Hill talking exactly  about this and nutty knows what their consumer rights or their data  protection rights are except to the E.U.  But I'll tell you, Lou, the other  thing that I think is going to strike fear into the hearts of these guys is  a gentleman by the name of Tim Berners-Lee.  He was one who originally  created the World Wide Web that runs on the internet.  He's now saying it's  time to take back control of our data, take back from Google so he's  building a system.  And I've seen part of this now, it works like you  actually control and own your data, nobody else owns it but you still get  the same functionality.  So I think -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Should this start -- should this start with the FCC is  contemporaneously with Congress? </p><p>WRIGHT:  It needs to start somewhere because, Lou, usually it has three  phases.  There's litigation -- there's regulation legislation. </p><p>DOBBS:  Got you.  Morgan, always great to get your thoughts and your  insights.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, appreciate it.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, sir. </p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, President Trump lays out what the upcoming Midterms mean  for him, for us, our country.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  This election is choice between a Republican Party that is building  our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  More from the President's rally in Tennessee -- </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, we're -- well, we have a new NAFTA agreement and it's the  USMCA for Canada and Mexico and President Trump crediting tariffs while  announcing the new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico.  The President  addressing that just moments ago from at a rally for Marsha Blackburn in  Johnson City, Tennessee.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have two wonderful partners now.  Now, they're partners Mexico  and Canada and that's a good thing.  That's a good thing.  America is  winning again and America is being respected again because we are finally  putting America first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  America first.  And a reminder to pre-order Burgess Owens' brand  new book.  Pre-order it.  The book Why I Stand: From Freedom to the Killing  Fields of Socialism.  It's out October 30th.  We recommend it highly.   Thanks for being with us.  Good night from New York.</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  The Senate's top  Republican has a warning for Democrats, quit delaying, obstructing, and  resisting the confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Our top  stories, promise is kept.  President Trump eking a trade deal with Canada  and Mexico that does away with the job killing NAFTA replacing it with an  agreement that is fair and reciprocal, putting America first. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Once approved by Congress,  this new deal will be the most modern, up-to-date and balanced trade  agreement in the history of our country.  With the most advanced  protections for workers ever developed.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We'll take up the economic significance of President Trump's  historic agreement with the director of the White House Trade Counsel,  Peter Navarro.  Also the FBI's 7th, seven, that's seven, investigations of  Judge Brett Kavanaugh could conclude as early as tomorrow.  Radical Dimm  obstructionists are already criticizing the investigation, proving they  have no regard for either the truth, their pledges, and are only interested  in political results.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless  and outrageous tactics of the Democrat Party.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Republican Strategist Ed Rollins, New York Post Columnist, Michael  Goodwin here tonight to discuss the Supreme Court confirmation battle.  And  it is a battle to the death, it seems.  NFL ratings taking another hit as  Roger Goodell and the owners continue to do little in some cases absolutely  nothing to address the remaining anthem controversy that has fans  abandoning the sport in droves.</p><p>Retired player Burgess Owens joins us tonight to talk about what if  anything can be done to turn the NFL round and to restore proper respect  and regard for the very people who make it all possible, American fans.  We  begin with breaking news tonight.  The Senate Majority Leader, Senator  Mitch McConnell setting a time for the Senate to vote on Judge Brett  Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  The time for endless  delay and obstruction has come to a close.  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is  out of committee, we're considering it here on the floor and Mr. President  will be voting this week.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Senator McConnell's commitment to the President comes as we learn  that the FBI could, could wrap up its investigation into allegations  against Judge Kavanaugh by tomorrow.  Our other top stories, well, we'll  lead off with a big one.  President Trump tearing up NAFTA as promised,  announcing a historic trade deal with Canada and Mexico finally putting  America first.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of  fairness and reciprocity.  To me it is the most important word in trade  because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations, all over the  world and we're changing that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  By the way, the President, I want to point this out very quickly,  he's right about reciprocity as is often the case.  The President is the  first president in three decades to talk about reciprocity in a trade deal  with the United States.  It's extraordinary.  The President winning a major  concession with Canada, now easing restrictions on its dairy market,  allowing American farmers to export about half a billion dollars worth of  dairy products for the first time.</p><p>The agreement boosting the auto industry as well.  Requirements for 75  percent of auto content to be made in North America, up from 62 percent and  Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum remaining in place, a strategy he  says led to today's new continental trade agreement.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs,  that includes Congress, so please don't charge tariffs, without tariffs you  wouldn't be -- we wouldn't be standing here.  And we're totally prepared to  do that, if they don't negotiate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President's tough tactics on trade leading to a deal last week  with South Korea.  The European Union has come to the negotiating table.   As well, the United States and Japan have begun trade talks.  And India is  now also seeking a deal.  President Trump today saying China wants to talk,  \"very badly\", but the President also says it's too soon.  The Trump  administration just last week imposed tariffs on $200 billion of exports  from China to the United States.</p><p>Our first guest tonight with the president during the Rose Garden trade  announcement and joining us is Peter Navarro, assistant to the president,  director of Trade and Industrial Policy, the director of the White House  Trade Council.  Good to have you with us, Peter.  Let's turn first of all  first of all -- well, first of all, let's say congratulations to you, to  the Trumo White House, and to the President.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  One fine day  in America, one fine day in North America with this deal.  I always -- it  was just precious being on the stage with the President.  You know, he  keeps saying, are you going to get tired of winning?   It's been a great 10  days, I mean, deals with Japan, deals with South Korea.  </p><p>DOBBS:  -- almost two years -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAVARRO:  It's amazing.  This president is putting down a record that is  the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern  history.  It's just amazing.  We don't hear about it on the press.  But  this record is amazing.  The economy is amazing.  And the funny thing, Lou,  is that he always gets criticized for being too tough.  Don't do this,  don't try that.  And sure enough it works.  And it work like charm today  and it's a good deal for both Canada and Mexico.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, I got to say to you, I don't think the president is being  criticized that much anymore.  I think he's certainly being criticized, you  know, that part of the left, the national left-wing media, they're going to  keep the nonsense up, they don't understand economics.  They don't  understand politics, history or the national interests.  The President  schools them each day.  At some point you would think they would learn.</p><p>But as you watch the press today, you know, there's a group that it's not  worth the time.  You know, I look at this and I say this is terrific and  for Mexico and Canada, does want to remain in something he calls the USMCA,  the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement instead of NAFTA.  You know, I  love that because it doesn't imply something that it's not.  It's a trade  agreement, straightforward, simple, for everybody to understand.</p><p>It doesn't imply a North American Free Trade Agreement because it's not.   It is a reciprocal balanced trade agreement.  And secondly it doesn't imply  a North American Union, harmonization of borders and a coming together of  three nations into one massive, you know, central command, of course, led  by the elites.  So, I'm very -- I'm thrilled with what the President has  accomplished here.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  And really, it hits three points in the triangle.  For me, having  a deal that's going to make this hemisphere the regional manufacturing base  for the world, it's going to bring back our supply chain through tough  regional content rules and labor rules, that's number one.  We've got  modernization of the agreement so bring things in like digital trade and  biologics which didn't exist in 1994.</p><p>And farmers made out very, very well today.  Not just dairy, chicken, eggs,  other things.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, the Chinese who have been trying to run their propaganda  through the newspapers in the Midwest and, you know, various outlets will  be pleased to hear that.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, there was some pretty strong signals in the agreement as  well.  There's a strong provision there on currency and currency  manipulation.  And last week, Lou, this went unnoticed like so much of what  President Trump does.  There was an amazing statement -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, it doesn't go unnoticed here, Peter.  I don't know who you  are talking to, but this audience knows what he's doing.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Absolutely, Lou.  You've been on this for 20 years, and these  days -- </p><p>DOBBS:  So what is it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  What is it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>NAVARRO:  So last week Japan, Europe and the United States led by the  Ambassador Lighthizer issued a joint statement basically condemning the  practices of China with regard to forced technology transfer and these huge  nonmarket subsidies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  I think that's Great, peter, but I got to be really honest with  you.  I'm ready for the statement that they're not going to permit the  theft of intellectual property from this country ever again.  And that as  they continue intellectual property theft, there will be consequences.   We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars as you know.  I don't frankly  give a darn about a collegial multi-state agreement.</p><p>I want this country to stand up and insist that it not happen further.  I  don't care if it's part of an agreement.  The hell with the agreement.   It's our property.  It ought to stop.  It ought to stop now.  OK?</p><p>NAVARRO:  I will give you an amen to that, Lou.  And the President's  already imposed $250 billion worth of tariffs on China for stealing our  stuff.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I think that's wonderful.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  But this statement last week is important because it wasn't -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  I appreciate it, Peter.  We're out of time.  I do.  I'm thrilled  that the President has succeeded in this agreement.  This is a wonderful  achievement for the administration, for this presidency.  And for the  director of the trade council.  Congratulations, Peter.  Thanks so much and  --</p><p>NAVARRO:  Thank so much, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- we -- nobody watching you on this broadcast is tired of winning  at all.   Thanks.  Up next, the shameless national left-wing media using today's  historic trade deal announcement to berate President Trump about Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In a tweet this weekend, Mr. President, you said that  it's incorrect to say you are limiting the scope of the FBI investigation.  </p><p>TRUMP:  What does that have to do with trade?  I don't mind answering the  question, but, you know, I would like to do the trade question.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It has to do with the other headline in the news  which is the Kavanaugh nomination.  </p><p>TRUMP:  No.  But -- I know.  But how about talking about trade and then  we'll go to that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do have a question on the Kavanaugh thing when you  get back to it if you take that.  You will take that now?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No, no.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  Well, the question --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You said the FBI should interview whoever they  believe is appropriate.  Does that include Julie Swetnick, the third  accuser?  And can you promise to release the full findings -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  Give me your question, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- after they finish the report, Mr. President?</p><p>TRUMP:  Give me a question, please.  Give her the mic, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you saying your White House has put no  limitations on -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  No.  My White House is doing whatever the Senators want.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  No, no.  You don't -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Who they should interview?  </p><p>TRUMP:  You don't understand what I'm saying.  You do understand, you just  don't want to report it that way.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President, you know, you wouldn't think there would be that  many people who call themselves journalists, professionals, who don't  understand about manners and respect for the President and the White House.   We'll take that up with Ed Rollins and Michael Goodwin.  Should the  President be putting up with this nonsense?  That's also part of the  message as we continue in just one moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A Senior Republican Senate source tells Fox News that the FBI's  investigation into Judge Kavanaugh could wrap up as early as tomorrow.   This after the President was asked at least -- are you ready?  -- 11  questions about the Kavanaugh investigation and this at a time when the  President has -- was seeking some kind of order dealing first with trade  and then -- and I have to say, there is no recognizable standard of conduct  in the White House for the President of the United States.  This is  outrageous.</p><p>And I'm -- and I'm saying this as a journalist.  I am just outraged.  The  President stated once again he backs the investigation, but he wants it  done according to the terms requested by the Senate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation, whatever that  means according to the Senators and the Republicans and the Republican  majority.  I want them to do that.  I want it to be comprehensive.  I  actually think it is a good thing for Judge Kavanaugh.  I think it's  actually a good thing, not a bad thing.  I think it's a good thing.  Now,  with that being said, I'd like it to go quickly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  The President's position is the same as when he called for it last  week.  But already the radical Dems are trying to -- well, they want to  change the direction.  They've made an agreement.  They've torn that one  up.  And now they want a new one, and they want to tell everybody what the  FBI should be looking into.  You know, all of the subjects and issues and  events that they didn't question Judge Kavanaugh about when they had the  opportunity.</p><p>And they didn't when they had the opportunity to do the same with Dr. Ford.   We wouldn't be in this position, had it not been for the tortured confused  soul of the two-face Senator from Arizona, Snowflake, Arizona, by the way,  Jeff Flake who said he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh without a  supplemental FBI investigation.  Flake admitting that he only called for  the investigation because of his failed Senatorial career.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could you have done this if you were running for  reelection?  </p><p>REP. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  No, not a chance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not a chance.</p><p>FLAKE:  No.  No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because politics has become too sharp?  Too partisan?  </p><p>FLAKE:  Yes.  There's no value to reaching across the aisle.  There's no  currency for that anymore.  There's no incentive.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Wait a minute.  All the Democratic Senators on that committee were  telling everybody this isn't a partisan moment.  Yet Senator Flake has  discovered something.  It is a partisan moment, a bitterly hostile vicious  partisan moment.  In fact, despite Flake's call for an investigation,  despite the radical Dems pushing for more and more and more, nothing will  ever be good enough for the left.</p><p>New York Congressman Nadler talk about the left.  He made it very clear no  matter what the FBI finds, Congressional Dems will not be satisfied.  They  will not stop their smear campaign against Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D), NEW YORK:  This has got to be thoroughly  investigated.  I hope the Senate will do so.  If he is on the Supreme  Court, and the Senate hasn't investigated, then I -- then the House will  have to. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't he eloquent?  The House will have to.  With only 36 days to  go, until the midterms, statements like Nadler's make it clear what the  radical left is and that the radical left will stop at nothing to undermine  President Trump's agenda and destroy a great American jurist and a great  American.  Well, joining us tonight, top strategist for Great America PAC,  former Reagan White House political director, Fox News Political Analyst,  Ed Rollins.</p><p>New York Post Columnist, Fox Business Contributor, Michael Goodwin.  Thank  you both for being here.  I have to ask you, watching those people in the  White House Press Corps, ignorantly behave as they have, what in the world  is going to turn that around because that is a way in which the national  left-wing media is confusing the President's message and they are forcing  the President to correct their ill-mannered disrespect.  </p><p>MICHAEL GOODWIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  It is remarkable to watch it  time and again.  I mean, it's not just the questions they ask, but the  argumentative tone.  They interrupt the President.  Never saw that before.   But only this president.  The good news is they don't seem to matter.  I  mean, his success is not dependent on their recognition of it.  I think the  people -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't it time for somebody in that communications department?  I  mean somebody, whoever it may be, to start laying down some basic protocols  and etiquette and just a baseline for just decent behavior? </p><p>GOODWIN:  I think they have tried.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They have tried?  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes, yes.  I mean, they have cut CNN out of certain meetings and  things like that.  The problem is, the media itself has now become so  radicalized that it used to be that the press corps would sort of police  its own behavior.  Now it is just we're all -- we're all together against  him, that's the mood.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Do you -- would you like one of these networks to try to perform,  Ed?  Without the President?  I mean, if the President of the United States  tells the communications people, anyone who interrupts me again, this has  got to be, you know, it's got to end somewhere.  CNN would -- could their  ratings go lower?  I can guarantee you they can go lower.  You stop Jim  Acosta from behaving as he does, acting out?  </p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, the bottom line he doesn't have to  deal with it that way.  You know, President Obama to his credit basically  always had four or five people he hand-picked he was going to call on.  He  didn't call on anybody else.  He didn't have to go out to this PAC like  this, we have a very important decision or announcement to make.</p><p>DOBBS:  So what's going on?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think -- I think the White House communications operation is  failing and our old friend Bill Shine he's got all of it.  Put a choke  collar on some of these people.  And the President stand up there and  perform.  </p><p>DOBBS:  I have never known Bill Shine to be a reticent force at an  organization.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he needs -- he needs to be.  He's got the job now and he  needs to basically create some discipline and not leave the President out  there vulnerable to this PAC.  The bottom line is he needs to stand out  there and make the announcements and not have the press there answering  questions.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.  I think that's one way around it.  You don't need to have a  press conference.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, the President enjoys it because he basically dribbles their  little -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROLLINS:  He loves to banter and punts back.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  -- the White House lawn.  But it's -- first of all, but this is  becoming extraordinary in the disrespect towards the President.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Absolutely, it is.</p><p>DOBBS:  They can't -- they can't compete with him intellectually.  They  have no knowledge base to deal with.  They have no idea what in many  instances there is no -- there is just no comparison with the president.   Simply put, if they all talked at once, it still wouldn't be a fair fight.   But at the same time, they are -- you know, it's a disturbance in the  atmosphere.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Who is going to control the agenda?  Are they going to talk about  what he -- they want to talk about what he -- they want to talk about even  what the President wants to talk about and the accomplishments that he's  made including today with this enormous treaty that no one thought he could  pull it off and he's pulled it off.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Oh, it's extraordinary.  Very quickly.  Let's go to a number of  things.  Bernie Sanders quote -- let's -- I would request you inform the  FBI you will not consider their work complete until blah, blah, blah, the  same nonsense from Mazie Hirono, the Senator from Hawaii, you know, the  bull flies every -- in every direction from these people.  Why is anyone --  you know, to his credit, Senator McConnell says the vote comes this week.   Good luck.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes, yes, yes.  And Grassley had a wonderful letter back at  Sanders who -- look, I think the problem -- the Democrats revealed their  hand too early and they made it clear.  So now they have no credibility.   When they have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Too early.  Let's remind everybody that Chuck Schumer, the senior  Senator from New York, you know, told everybody, declared he was going to  stop -- he would destroy this guy, the day his name was announced.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Twenty-three minutes after, I believe.  </p><p>DOBBS:  The day that his name was announced by the President for this post.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  If we learn the lesson on the value of these elections, if the  House goes Democrat, Jerry Nadler will be chairman of the Oversight  Committee.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, that's frightening.  Should be frankly, it's frightening  that he's there.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>DOBBS:  And Maxine Waters will be chairman of the financial banking  institutions.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that will be a move for Jamie Dimon.  He will have some fun  then, huh?</p><p>ROLLINS:  So, just -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, it's -- we're going to show everyone an ad right now, very  quickly, we would like to run the commercial that Ed's PAC, the Great  America PAC has just put out defending Judge Kavanaugh.  Let's roll that,  if we could, please.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SCHUMER:  Judge Kavanaugh, I will oppose him with everything I've got.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Democrats admitted they would do anything to stop  Judge Kavanaugh from the start.  Instead of protecting Dr. Ford, they use  her, leaking her story, when she asked to be anonymous.  Democrats don't  care about protecting women and they never have.  Democrats have just one  goal, expanding their power.  We must confirm Judge Kavanaugh and reject  the Democrat power grab.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Ed, I think you have put out a very powerful product there.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  It is a truthful ad.</p><p>DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All about power.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Michael, you get the last word.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  I was going to say to Ed, how do you really feel? </p><p>ROLLINS:  Feel as strongly as Schumer does on the other side.  This is a  great man.  He should be on this court.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Couldn't agree more.  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Yes.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Have we -- have we got unanimity here?  </p><p>GOODWIN:  Absolutely.  </p><p>DOBBS:  All right.  Let me bring the gavel down.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you, gentlemen, appreciate it.  Be sure to vote in our poll  tonight.  Now that the President has secured the fair reciprocal trade deal  with Canada and Mexico, economic growth is soaring.  Stocks are near record  highs.  So what happens now?  Do you think a single bit of naysaying on the  part of left-wing savants who work for the fake news will admit they were  completely wrong now and President Trump absolutely right?</p><p>Wow, I can't wait to hear from you on this one.  I was -- I was just  thinking of a couple of New York Times economics writers, Nobel Laureate  one of them.  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  Coming up next, a gift  to the Republican Party, Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama are championing  the Dems push to the radical left.  More on these -- well, these hungry  campaigners.  We will let you decide what they are hungry for.</p><p>Washington Times Columnist Tammy Bruce joins me here next.  We're coming  right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump talking tonight at a rally in Johnson City,  Tennessee where he is supporting a senator -- the Congresswoman Marsha  Blackburn who wants to be the senator from Tennessee.  Touting his new  trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And just today we made  history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job- killing disaster known as NAFTA, with a brand new U.S.-Mexico Canada.  We  added Canada, worked out great, trade agreement.  And we're calling it  USMCA, no more NAFTA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Straight forward.  Former President Barack Obama putting his name  behind -- are you ready?  260 radical Dems in the midterms.  His extensive  list includes self-described socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New  York, Andrew Gillum in Florida.  A reminder in his eight years as  President, Obama presided over the Democratic Party loss of 63 seats in the  House, 10 in the Senate, as well as the loss of 12 governorships losing  more than a thousand, thousand Democratic --Democrats in his mere eight  years in office.  </p><p>And if you needed more proof of just how desperate the Dems are, they're  providing it, rolling out failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now  to push their radical agenda.  Those are cheers you hear from Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Imagine being able to hold  this administration accountable and actually make progress when it comes to  affordable health care, the rights of immigrants and refugees.  The urgent  challenge of climate change and yes, I could go on and on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  As she so often does.  As promised it would be a blessing for the  Republican Party as it seems that Dems still don't get why President Trump  is in office and not Hillary Clinton. </p><p>Well, joining us now Tammy Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business  contributor.  Great to have you with us Tammy.</p><p>First, to listen to Obama, to listen to Clinton, there have to be  Democratic candidates all over the country just quivering with fear at the  impact.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, Hillary it sounds like  she's running to be President of the European Union, certainly not this  country, right?</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  I look, we made a statement 2016 and both Barack Obama and Hillary  Clinton could not convince the American people when we had no idea how  extraordinary Donald Trump really would be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Around nefarious the Democrats were.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, exactly.  Now, that we've learned, we've got these  investigations, we found out exact -- well, I mean, it's really the tip of  the iceberg what we've learned about them.  But the fact is, Barack Obama  destroyed the Democratic Party.  That's why he has these very strange  individuals that he is supporting.  It's still though all about him, he's  desperate to not be seen as a failure and so is Hillary Clinton.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's too far too late.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, this is both of their problems.  They never viewed the  country as the priority.</p><p>DOBBS:  So, all we have to do is give up a country.  A constitutional  republic --</p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- leave it in ashes so that --</p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- we can pretend we care about their legacies, my God.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, they never cared about, they still don't think about the  average American --</p><p>DOBBS:  No, they care about -- remember --</p><p>BRUCE:  That is Donald Trump's strength.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They've demonstrated again in the Judiciary Committee how much they  care about women.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, they said on a woman's legitimate concerns and pain they  said for six weeks, they acknowledge, they leaked it to the press despite  her request for confidentiality.  And you can't even hear a whisper in the  left-wing media about holding them accountable.  Dianne Feinstein, Cory  Booker the list goes on.</p><p>BRUCE:  Her own lawyers who were referred to her by Senator Feinstein.  We  now believe of course mislead Dr. Ford about what her options would be when  it came to talking with the committee that they would go to California.   She clearly testified that she was unaware of that offer effectively.  That  is the kind of thing that needs to be investigated and I believe that that  is what we're going to be doing now, when it comes to how this woman was  misled.</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, we're becoming an investigative country, aren't we?  The  American people are going to have to take a look at what's in full view and  make a determination.  The radical element of this party is this, they've  taken over the Democratic Party, their conduct.  I mean, Chuck Schumer was  in a bit shaded nuanced.</p><p>BRUCE:  Not at all.</p><p>DOBBS:  He said point-blank he was going to destroy the president's nominee  if he could and that's what they have tried to do.</p><p>BRUCE:  And they want to eliminate due process, they want you to be guilty  and trying to prove yourself innocent.  I said in a column months ago that  the Democratic Party is really now Antifa.  It is -- it is that radical  element that has moved forward looking to destroy things for revenge with  no plan for the future and no desire to govern.</p><p>DOBBS:  You think -- do you think Kavanaugh gets the confirmation?</p><p>BRUCE:  You know, it depends on what happens this week.  It's a shame we've  given them another week, but I think so, yes.  I think we'll have it.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Great to see you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next President Trump's patriotism stands tall over the NFL.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>DOBBS:  Despite a marquee matchup last night between the Baltimore Ravens  and Pittsburgh Steelers ratings for Sunday Night Football fell 10 percent  from the previous week.  The NFL's national game on CBS between the Saints  and Giants also the lowest rated national game of this young NFL season</p><p>Joining us tonight, former NFL player for the New York Jets and the Oakland  Raiders Burgess Owens, author of the new book Why I Stand: From Freedom to  the Killing Fields of Socialism.  Burgess, great to have you with us.   Thanks so much.</p><p>BURGESS OWENS, AUTHOR, WHY I STAND:  Ho you doing, Lou?  Looking forward to  chatting with you my friend.</p><p>DOBBS:  And to you -- you know, it's just great to have you here.  I just  want to turn first to that game last night, these ratings for the NFL, no  one should start organizing a benefit for the NFL.  But my goodness, this  is just getting worse and worse.</p><p>OWENS:  Yes, well first of all, I didn't see the game.  I haven't really  seen a game for two years.  So, well, it comes down to it Lou, we have to  understand that this is -- this is on purpose.  We have an organization who  in the past was very patriotic.  We all remember the Al Davis days and Pete  Rozelle, we're now dealing with globalists.  </p><p>Then, there's two types by the way, there's the Republican and Democratic  globalist who care more about profits and patriotism and then, there's the  worst of the two as a leftist globalist who care about the socialist agenda  over patriotism.</p><p>We have an organization, it cares more about their international reach than  it care about the American brand and America -- and the American -- the NFL  fan.  These guys have already put in place 80 different countries, they  wanted they put into 200 like the Soccer League has.  It's all about T.V.  revenue.  They could care less about how full these stadiums are.  They get  their money and they share profits based on that T.V. revenue.  If they can  do in a global fashion, they'll be just like the soccer league with 200  countries tie-in no brand, no country brand but a global brand.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>OWENS:  And that's what their answer in the process of doing as they demean  our flag, demeaning our culture.  So, they will be accepted another place  like China and France and the other countries that are not so pro-American.</p><p>DOBBS:  As you -- as you put it and I have heard no one -- I mean, thank  you for that insight because frankly I hadn't considered that.  And I  suspect that lots of folks are just for the first time kind of wrapping  their heads around globalism its impact on the NFL.  And of course, that's  cumbersome.  I mean, we've seen it with this most recent movie about Neil  Armstrong and his -- you know, walking for the first time on the face of  the Moon.</p><p>OWENS:  Grab the flag.</p><p>DOBBS:  A great patriotic American, a great -- you, he was just an amazing  pilot, decorated.  He was just an amazing fellow.  And the American flag is  in front and center.  </p><p>And the -- and the reality is, you're right, the American flag becomes an  avatar for something that could maybe depress their global -- their global  expansion at the NFL.</p><p>OWENS:  Well, Lou, follow the money.  We have a commissioner who just  signed a contract with $40 million per year.  Only 10 percent of that for  me is guaranteed, the other 90 percent is based on his sentence.  Now,  understand, they've been dropping 20 percent, 13 percent of (INAUDIBLE)  last year, last couple years.  </p><p>But yet, then it capped -- or get capped out by the way 13 billion in the  United States.  We have to project in 27 billion in the next nine years  globally.</p><p>So, no, they don't care about America, they don't care about the American  fan who put them in place they are right now.  They're globalists and  globalist care more about their pocketbooks and their profits and the best  thing we can do is obviously not showing up is good thing but we need to  stop supporting their sponsors.  T.V. revenue is what gets into where they  are and now they share that equally, if we can we can hit them hard enough,  so that we hit them before they get their global things in place.  And  maybe they'll fire this commissioner and get somebody who cares about our  country about it -- about this brand and not trying to destroy.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that is a lot to consider.  Let me ask you this, do you  believe that there is within the NFL itself -- and I'm talking not to  management we know what the management is and the owners now.  There's no  more joke about what they'll -- they are.  But for the players, there  should be it seems to me, I hope that -- well, you could give me your  judgment, is there enough patriotism among those players to stand up for  the things that their fans care most about?  First the country in respect  for. </p><p>OWENS:  Well, this is why I'm glad that we have a president who drew a line  in the sand.  See what we're seeing on the field Lou, it's 20 years of  Marxist, socialist and atheists teaching our kids not to respect the flag,  not to say a prayer, not respect women or anything else.  So, these kids,  if you think about this, growing on for 20 years, 18, 20 years, hearing the  same anti-American, anti-white, anti-police.  They go stand on the  sidelines and believe that.  It doesn't matter what they have $20 million  in a pocketbook or one.  They're going to believe that because they've been  trained that.</p><p>We have around that field billions of dollars represented and not once have  they talked about collectively putting their funds together to start  businesses, how are these guys, these young men are not getting hired out  there educate our kids, our black kids that the left is not educating.  We  can do this within our own community if we understand we're up against.   This by the way, Americans do best.  We know we're in a fight and we're  going to fight right now.  It's our ideal Christian values against  Socialism, Marxism, atheism hates God.  And if we understand that,  understand what true evil is, then we'll stand up we'll win this fight.  We  need to start off at winning this particular midterm.  We need to push out  our American way further and not let the left do their deal.</p><p>DOBBS:  They're sure trying and you're absolutely right.  Burgess, thanks  for being with us.  Great to see you. </p><p>OWENS:  Thank you, Lou.  I appreciate it, buddy.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Burgess Owens, thank you, a great American.  Up next, Facebook  facing a massive fine for its latest major data breach but it's not the  United States concerned about just you know, married users.  You know, it's  at least according to well Silicon Valley.  We take it up with  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.  He's here next.  This is a big deal.   Stay with us, we'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  As I said, the President is speaking tonight at a rally in Johnson  City Tennessee.  He's there to support his Supreme Court two choice Judge  Brett Kavanaugh as well as Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn running for the  Senate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he  was announced because they know the Judge Kavanaugh will follow the  Constitution as written.  They're trying to destroy a very fine person and  we can't let it happen. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  European -- the European Union looking into fining Facebook for  more than $1 billion after the recent cyber-attack, 50 million users' data  taken in that attack.  Ireland's data protection commission is demanding  more information from Facebook about the scale of the data theft and the  cyber-attack you -- in which you residents were victimized in the attack.   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the company takes the breach very  seriously.  </p><p>You would think they would take it seriously.  50 million people's personal  data stolen in a cyber-attack and Facebook still doesn't know who is behind  the hack and we haven't been really given too much information about the  timeline when the attack occurred, when Facebook found out, and how they  notified 50 million people. </p><p>Joining us tonight cyber-security expert Morgan Wright, when -- and it's  great to see you, Morgan.  Thanks for being with us.  </p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  You bet, Lou. </p><p>There is such arrogance on the part of these big tech firms, social media,  it's -- it is really repulsive to hear Zuckerberg billionaire saying their  -- Facebook is taking this seriously.  Really?  Really?  They have to say  that.  My gosh. </p><p>Well, you know what strikes more fear into the heart of Mark Zuckerberg  than Batman, the GDPR and Irish Data Protection Commission because now  they're going to hit these companies where it hurts the most and that's  financially.  These -- all these companies wanted to be global and I in  your last seven you're talking to Burgess about the globalism, we'll all  these companies wants it global -- </p><p>DOBBS:  That was a great point was it, Burgess, I mean he nailed that. </p><p>WRIGHT:  He nailed -- he nailed it.  And -- but you know what, that  translates now into the business environment.  All these companies want to  be global, well guess what, now you have to play the baseline becomes the  strictest set of rules that are out there and the people who have them are  the E.U.  And you know what, they've actually got teeth behind these rules  to where now the Data Protection Commission, the little -- this little  agency in Ireland now is going to bring Facebook to the E.U. and say show  us the information and we'll decide if we're going to find you $1.6 billion  or not. </p><p>DOBBS:  And meanwhile, we have the CEO of Google telling basically all of  Congress, go to hell.  I'll show up and well talk with you privately and  maybe we'll talk sometime later.  You've got the chair of Facebook saying  we're taking it seriously when obviously it's the opposite or 50 million  people wouldn't have their user data, their personal data stolen a cyber- attack by Facebook knows not who. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Well you know -- and Lou, the other thing too about this.  This  wasn't Facebook data.  The way Facebook works too is they have what they  call single sign-on which means that you can use Facebook now to sign into  up services.  So not only was Facebook affected but if you signed a three  or four other sides using your Facebook credentials, you might have or had  your information stolen from those sites as well.  So it's much bigger than  Facebook alone. </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  That's why I said user personal data because of that  potentiality.  I -- what is the -- you know, all we're going to hear now  from Silicon Valley no regulation, no accountability of any kind.  They are  spending a fortune to make certain that they remain monopolistic.  For  example, Google sending reportedly tens of billions of dollars to do so.   The other companies, I'm sure doing -- social media companies they're doing  the same.  What can be done to bring them under control and to protect the  rights of citizens?  By the way, they're citizens not just consumers that  we -- that we have to say that for the benefit of the titans of Silicon  Valley. </p><p>WRIGHT:  You know, recently I wrote an article for Hill talking exactly  about this and nutty knows what their consumer rights or their data  protection rights are except to the E.U.  But I'll tell you, Lou, the other  thing that I think is going to strike fear into the hearts of these guys is  a gentleman by the name of Tim Berners-Lee.  He was one who originally  created the World Wide Web that runs on the internet.  He's now saying it's  time to take back control of our data, take back from Google so he's  building a system.  And I've seen part of this now, it works like you  actually control and own your data, nobody else owns it but you still get  the same functionality.  So I think -- </p><p>DOBBS:  Should this start -- should this start with the FCC is  contemporaneously with Congress? </p><p>WRIGHT:  It needs to start somewhere because, Lou, usually it has three  phases.  There's litigation -- there's regulation legislation. </p><p>DOBBS:  Got you.  Morgan, always great to get your thoughts and your  insights.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, appreciate it.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, sir. </p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, President Trump lays out what the upcoming Midterms mean  for him, for us, our country.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  This election is choice between a Republican Party that is building  our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  More from the President's rally in Tennessee -- </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, we're -- well, we have a new NAFTA agreement and it's the  USMCA for Canada and Mexico and President Trump crediting tariffs while  announcing the new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico.  The President  addressing that just moments ago from at a rally for Marsha Blackburn in  Johnson City, Tennessee.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have two wonderful partners now.  Now, they're partners Mexico  and Canada and that's a good thing.  That's a good thing.  America is  winning again and America is being respected again because we are finally  putting America first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  America first.  And a reminder to pre-order Burgess Owens' brand  new book.  Pre-order it.  The book Why I Stand: From Freedom to the Killing  Fields of Socialism.  It's out October 30th.  We recommend it highly.   Thanks for being with us.  Good night from New York.</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  The Senate's top  Republican has a warning for Democrats, quit delaying, obstructing, and  resisting the confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

In addition to revelations surrounding new research regulations in process, the hearing, titled Cannabis Policy For the New Decade, included a brief statement from Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) on his personal evolution on this issue, including his opinion that Prohibition has clearly failed and America isn't waiting for its government anymore. Watch the full hearing, linked in the article above.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joe Biden again says no to marijuana legalization without more studies - Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) reiterated his opposition to federal legalization, without more studies. Instead, Biden's cannabis reform plan involves rescheduling the plant to make it easier for researchers to access, decriminalizing simple possession and expunging prior cannabis records. Read the full interview here.</p><p>Congress should make cannabis research less cumbersome, APA says in written testimony - The American Psychological Association issued a statement asking Congress to remove roadblocks to cannabis studies, including calling for the Drug Enforcement Administration to be relieved of its role in reviewing requests to conduct such research. Instead, institutional review boards and the FDA are more appropriate bodies to manage this task, said APA Chief Scientific Officer Russell D. Shilling, PhD, in prepared remarks.</p><p>States</p><p>FL - Make it Legal Florida will not put a constitutional amendment on the 2020 ballot, the group announced Monday. Instead, it is shifting its focus to a 2022 ballot initiative. Meanwhile, a ballot initiative by Sensible Florida has also stalled. According to the Florida Division of Elections, the group so far has only 92,805 verified petition signatures. The signature requirement for 2020 measures is 766,200.</p><p>IL - Illinois regulators are investigating some dispensaries for violations of the state law requirement that no more than 40 percent of product inventory come from one cultivator. The law is aimed at preventing cultivators from entering into exclusive agreements with specific dispensaries and making sure all stores have a diversity of products from different sources.</p><p>KY - David W. Osborne (R), Kentucky's House speaker, said at a hearing on the issue that if medical cannabis is legalized in Kentucky it should not be taxed.</p><p>NH - New Hampshire lawmakers are looking to legalize low-level cannabis possession and home cultivation without adding a commercial market, an approach similar to Vermont's. A bipartisan bill is scheduled to get a hearing on January 23.</p><p>NJ - The New Jersey Appellate Division ruled that employers may lawfully reimburse workers for medical cannabis, finding that the payments would not violate the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The court notably rejected the employer's argument that the payments were akin to aiding and abetting a crime and relied on the fact that the employer had failed to show that the federal government aims to enforce the CSA in any state in which medical cannabis has been legalized. Importantly, the court found that compliance with the order does not establish the specific intent element of an aiding and abetting offense under federal law.</p><p>NJ - A New Jersey court said regulators cannot review new medical cannabis business licenses while applicants who were rejected on technicalities challenge the process.</p><p>NM - Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) formally asked lawmakers to legalize cannabis during the short 30-day legislative session beginning this month by including the issue in her written session call. Additionally, she asked lawmakers to pass a bill making clear that the state's medical cannabis program applies only to residents, reversing a court ruling to the contrary. The following day, legislators filed an adult legalization bill. Introduced by Sen. Jerry Ortiz y Pino (D) and Rep. Javier Martinez (D), the legislation would allow adults in the state to possess and purchase cannabis from licensed retailers. It also includes a number of restorative justice and social equity provisions. Observers have expressed skepticism of the bill's chances in 2020. We understand that a research bill may be considered as an alternative.</p><p>RI - Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) submitted a 2021 budget proposal to lawmakers that includes a plan to legalize cannabis and sell it through state-run stores. Already, however, the proposal seems unlikely to succeed as top lawmakers in the state are pushing back against the plan.</p><p>SD - A cannabis legalization measure officially qualified for the 2020 ballot in South Dakota. The development comes one month after the secretary of state said that a separate campaign to legalize medical cannabis in the state had also submitted the required valid signatures to qualify for the 2020 ballotmeaning that voters will see both medical and adult-use measures when they go to the polls in November. This means South Dakota could be the first state to legalize medical and adult-use at the same time.</p><p>VA - The ACLU of Virginia said instead of enacting cannabis decriminalization in the short term, it would \"prefer the status quo while we're waiting for full legalization.\" Its comments are in response to proposed bills that would replace a criminal fine with a civil penalty, which the organization finds problematic.</p><p>WA - Washington State regulators will adopt 18 cannabis enforcement changes recommended by consulting firm Hillard Heintze. Three themes emerged in the firm's recommendations: (1) a need for greater consistency in how interpretations of agency decisions are communicated and applied; (2) a need for greater transparency and understanding by stakeholders about agency decisions and interpretations; and (3) a need for stronger outreach, communication, education and collaboration with the industry.</p><p>Hemp/CBD</p><p>Federal - A new bill filed by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D-MN) and bipartisan cosponsors would allow the marketing of CBD as a dietary supplement by amending the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to include CBD in the definition of dietary supplements.</p><p>Federal - A federal judge ruled that CBD maker Green Roads shouldn't face liability claims in a class action lawsuit until the Food and Drug Administration completes a review of policies for such products: The FDA regulations currently provide little guidance with respect to whether CBD ingestibles, in all their variations are food supplements, nutrients or additives and what labelling standards are applicable to each iteration, the judge stated. This decision is likely to be cited by defendants in the current California lawsuits against ingestible hemp product manufacturers and any that may arise in the future. Read the full decision here.</p><p>US Department of Agriculture - The USDA filed a Federal Register notice about a new data collection system it is creating to keep track of hemp production license applications. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments by February 28, 2020 here.</p><p>Cowen's Equity Research - Cowen published its key takeaways from a CBD Policy Summit in Washington, DC, including that strong consumer demand is advancing the ball, according to the results of December 2019 survey of US consumers in which 10 percent of respondents reported having used CBD as a supplement.</p><p>International</p><p>EU - The European Commission is proposing a unified EU vote on six pending World Health Organization cannabis scheduling recommendations. If those countries vote as a block, they will represent almost a quarter of the total votes within the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs. Among its recommended actions are: (1) to vote in favor of removing cannabis from Schedule IV of the 1961 convention (which would signal cannabis has therapeutic value while maintaining the status quo); and (2) postponing a vote on adding a footnote saying that preparations containing predominantly cannabidiol and not more than 0.2% of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol are not under international control.</p><p>Barbados - The island country's agriculture minister said the government plans to begin issuing medical cannabis cultivation licenses next month. Barbados will adopt a tiered approach to cultivation and processor permits, ranging from Tier 1 for small-scale cultivation to Tier 3 for large-scale farms.</p><p>UK - Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the government will not legalize cannabis anytime soon. We have to be very clear controlled drugs, dangerous drugs are unlawful, they're illegal, they're criminal to possess or supply, he said in an interview with LBC, a London-based national phone-in and talk radio station.</p><p>Business</p><p>Metrics - Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics published a report finding that global legal cannabis sales rose 48 percent, to $15 billion, in 2019. Additionally, sales in 2020 are forecast to increase by 38 percent driven by growth in established markets and continued geographic expansion, including Illinois' recreational market opening. The disconnect between investor sentiment and the facts on the ground is as dramatic as anything I've seen since the dot.com stock crash of 2000, which happened just as the internet caught fire with consumers, said Tom Adams, editor-in-chief of Arcview Market Research and managing director of BDS Analytics Industry Intelligence. Five billion additional dollars were spent on legal cannabis in 2019 [than in 2018]. That's bigger than the entire legal cannabis market was in 2015.</p><p>Cresco - Cresco's Illinois employees joined the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Zach Koutsky, legislative and political director for the local chapter, anticipates far more union involvement in the state's cannabis industry as it grows.</p><p>Trends - XpertHR finds cannabis one of top HR concerns for 2020.</p><p>Medical/Health</p><p>Impaired driving - For those of you who may have been alarmed by headlines claiming that a study showed that cannabis use affects automobile drivers days after use (CNN: Weed impairs driving skills long after the high is gone), here is an article describing the nuances and limitations of the study. To see the original study, click here.</p><p>CBD research - A review concluded that \"pre-clinical research using animal models of innate fear and anxiety-like behaviors have found anxiolytic, antistress, anticompulsive, and panicolytic-like effects of CBD\" and that \"preliminary evidence from human trials using both healthy volunteers and individuals with social anxiety disorder, suggests that CBD may have anxiolytic [i.e., anti-anxiety] effects.\"</p><p>Magic Mushrooms - A UK-based mental health care company announced it has been granted a US patent for a formulation that includes an active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms, which the company is researching as a treatment for drug-resistant depression. Basically, shrooms have been patented, which will have a whole host of implications. Stay tuned.</p><p>Dentons Speaks</p><p>In Ready for the next episode?

(\"Upstart Network\") to use alternative data (such as education and employment history) and machine learning for the purpose of an underwriting and pricing model. The no-action letter was contingent on Upstart Network providing the CFPB with information about compared results between (i) its credit underwriting and pricing model (a tested model) and (ii) a more standard model. Upstart Network was tasked with answering:</p><p> whether the Alternative Model's use of alternative data and machine learning would increase access to credit; andif the Alternative Model's underwriting or pricing results create greater disparities than the traditional model (i.e., race, ethnicity, sex, age).</p><p>Based on the information gathered by Upstart Network, the CFPB found that:</p><p> access-to-credit comparisons showed the Alternative Model approved 27 percent more applicants than the traditional model, in addition to yielding 16 percent lower average annual percentage rates (\"APRs\") for approved loans;the expansion of credit access increased the acceptance rates in the Alternative Model for all tested races, ethnicity and sex segments by 23-29 percent while decreasing the average APRs by 15-17 percent;\"near prime\" consumers in the Alternative Model with FICO scores between 620 and 660 were approved nearly twice as frequently;applicants under 25 years of age in the Alternative Model were 32 percent more likely to be approved; andconsumers in the Alternative Model with incomes under $50,000 were 13 percent more likely to be approved.</p><p>Commentary</p><p>Should the regulators be approving credit models based on whether they are happy with the results? What happens if another credit scoring metric produces different or less favored results: does that metric become illegal to use without regard to the process of its production or its accuracy?</p><p>Big data raises lot of important social/moral questions; and \"disparate impact\" is one of the more complex ones. For some background discussion of \"big tech,\" \"big data\" and credit scoring, see \"Big tech in finance: opportunities and risks,\" particularly the discussion of credit provision beginning on page 60, and Senate Banking Committee Considers Testimony on Consumer Data Vendors.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs and degrade quality. Simply put, they have too much power, Rhode Island Democrat and subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline said Wednesday.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos - the world's richest person - defended the online retailer's practices and its dominant market share. Bezos told the lawmakers 80 percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon overall.</p><p>There are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon, Bezos said in his first appearance before Congress. The trust customers put in us every day has allowed Amazon to create more jobs in the United States over the past decade than any other country.</p><p>But a number of familiar U.S. retailers are in financial trouble, and some economists say Amazon is partially to blame.</p><p>Bezos repeated his denials that Amazon deliberately stole information from its online sellers so it could manufacture its own products and directly compete with its sellers.</p><p>We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private-label business. But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated, Bezos said.</p><p>Google's Sundar Pichai also denied accusations that his company steals from other businesses, specifically from Yelp, the customer review website.</p><p>We conduct ourselves to the highest standards, he said.</p><p>Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio accused the big tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, of being out to get conservatives. Users of both platforms come from a wide spectrum of political beliefs, but they can tailor their feeds to provide information from sources they prefer.</p><p>\"We're 97 days before an election ... the power these companies have to impact what happens during an election, what people what American citizens get to see prior to their voting is pretty darn important, Jordan said. We all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies. But what's not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections.\"</p><p>The companies have consistently denied all allegations of censorship and trying to manipulate the U.S. electorate.</p><p>Some antitrust experts have criticized U.S. lawmakers and regulators for what they say is weak government oversight of the tech giants, especially compared with stronger enforcement in Europe.</p><p>President Donald Trump, who has also been critical of the companies, tweeted Wednesday that If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.</p><p>If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.

They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs and degrade quality. Simply put, they have too much power, Rhode Island Democrat and subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline said Wednesday.</p><p>WATCH Judiciary Committee Hearing LIVE</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos - the world's richest person - defended the online retailer's practices and its dominant market share. Bezos told the lawmakers 80 percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon overall.</p><p>There are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon, Bezos said in his first appearance before Congress. The trust customers put in us every day has allowed Amazon to create more jobs in the United States over the past decade than any other country.</p><p>But a number of familiar U.S. retailers are in financial trouble, and some economists say Amazon is partially to blame.</p><p>Bezos repeated his denials that Amazon deliberately stole information from its online sellers so it could manufacture its own products and directly compete with its sellers.</p><p>We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private-label business. But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated, Bezos said.</p><p>Google's Sundar Pichai also denied accusations that his company steals from other businesses, specifically from Yelp, the customer review website.</p><p>We conduct ourselves to the highest standards, he said.</p><p>Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio accused the big tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, of being out to get conservatives. Users of both platforms come from a wide spectrum of political beliefs, but they can tailor their feeds to provide information from sources they prefer.</p><p>\"We're 97 days before an election ... the power these companies have to impact what happens during an election, what people what American citizens get to see prior to their voting is pretty darn important, Jordan said. We all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies. But what's not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections.\"</p><p>The companies have consistently denied all allegations of censorship and trying to manipulate the U.S. electorate.</p><p>Some antitrust experts have criticized U.S. lawmakers and regulators for what they say is weak government oversight of the tech giants, especially compared with stronger enforcement in Europe.</p><p>President Donald Trump, who has also been critical of the companies, tweeted Wednesday that If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.</p><p>If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.

They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs and degrade quality. Simply put, they have too much power, Rhode Island Democrat and subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline said Wednesday.</p><p>WATCH Judiciary Committee Hearing LIVE</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos - the world's richest person - defended the online retailer's practices and its dominant market share. Bezos told the lawmakers 80 percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon overall.</p><p>There are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon, Bezos said in his first appearance before Congress. The trust customers put in us every day has allowed Amazon to create more jobs in the United States over the past decade than any other country.</p><p>But a number of familiar U.S. retailers are in financial trouble, and some economists say Amazon is partially to blame.</p><p>Bezos repeated his denials that Amazon deliberately stole information from its online sellers so it could manufacture its own products and directly compete with its sellers.</p><p>We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private-label business. But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated, Bezos said.</p><p>Google's Sundar Pichai also denied accusations that his company steals from other businesses, specifically from Yelp, the customer review website.</p><p>We conduct ourselves to the highest standards, he said.</p><p>Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio accused the big tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, of being out to get conservatives. Users of both platforms come from a wide spectrum of political beliefs, but they can tailor their feeds to provide information from sources they prefer.</p><p>\"We're 97 days before an election ... the power these companies have to impact what happens during an election, what people what American citizens get to see prior to their voting is pretty darn important, Jordan said. We all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies. But what's not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections.\"</p><p>The companies have consistently denied all allegations of censorship and trying to manipulate the U.S. electorate.</p><p>Some antitrust experts have criticized U.S. lawmakers and regulators for what they say is weak government oversight of the tech giants, especially compared with stronger enforcement in Europe.</p><p>President Donald Trump, who has also been critical of the companies, tweeted Wednesday that If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.</p><p>If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.

It is encouraging to see that both the House and Senate held recent hearings on cryptocurrency and that members of the Trump administration are giving cryptocurrency the attention that it deserves through appropriate channels like the Financial Stability Oversight Council.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Equally notable is the Security and Exchange Commission's effort to help issuers of cryptocurrency easily ascertain whether or not their cryptocurrency is a security.</p><p>Cryptocurrency is receiving attention in Washington because it could revolutionize our payment systems or serve as a 21<sup>st</sup> century medium of exchange that will enhance commerce throughout the world. It could lead to greater access to affordable financial services and products for underbanked people. It also could help companies raise the capital they need to prosper.</p><p>Even with all the potential of cryptocurrency, a thorough public examination must continue on the important cryptocurrency policy matters such as privacy, trading, national security, and monetary effects.</p><p>Cryptocurrency concerns have not gone unnoticed by President Trump who recently tweeted that he is \"not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies,\" that \"Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior,\" and that their values are based on \"thin air.\" He also opined that if cryptocurrency companies \"want to become a bank\" that they need a charter and be subject to banking regulation.</p><p>Cryptocurrency at the center of debate in Washington makes it more likely that the potential impact of it is fully thought through; enabling decision-makers, including American consumers, to make informed choices when it comes to the potential adoption of cryptocurrency.</p><p>Avoiding Overregulation</p><p>That being said, it is important to remember that Washington must be careful not to overregulate cryptocurrency, preventing the American people from their opportunity to see where cryptocurrency innovations could go.</p><p>One example of going too far would be for Congress to move forward with draft legislation called the Keep Big Tech out of Finance Act. This draft, written by House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters' (D-CA) staff, would prevent some of our nation's most prominent technology companies from participating in the ever evolving world of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Specifically, the legislation bans technology companies with annual global revenue of $25 billion or more, that are \"predominately engaged in the business of offering to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties,\" from two things.</p><p>First, it prohibits large technology companies from becoming a financial institution.</p><p>Second, it prohibits large technology companies from establishing, maintaining, or operating cryptocurrency. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System would determine what constitutes cryptocurrency and covered technology companies found in violation of either ban would be subject to a fine of up to $1 million per day.</p><p>While the intent of the draft legislation is clearlarge technology companies must not be involved in cryptocurrencyit is unclear why the size of a technology company makes it more or less fit to operate in the cryptocurrency market. After all, large technology companies employ some of the brightest minds in their industry and their expertise no doubt would be instrumental in solving some of the problems facing cryptocurrency.</p><p>Additionally, if the proper standards are adopted and implemented, large technology companies are no more or less vulnerable to cyberattacks or privacy problems. Furthermore, if a large technology company is willing to abide by the same laws and regulations as financial institutions, why should they not be granted the opportunity to compete? It's generally better for consumers to have more choices, not less.</p><p>Finally, if America is going to continue to be a center of technological innovation, Washington should encourage companies, especially those with well-documented commercial success in technology, to advance financial technology, instead of picking winners and losers, and driving such innovation to foreign countries with more favorable regulatory environments.</p><p>This way, leaders in Washington can have the best of both worlds: financial technological innovation that directly benefits their constituents and rightsized oversight of it to ensure it meets the standards of the American people.</p><p>Originally published by Bloomberg Law</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Our previous entry discussed the ,  energy, Brexit, and  health privacy. Next up: trends in GDPR enforcement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Out of all governmental agencies, state attorneys general are likely to have the greatest impact on privacy enforcement in 2020 for the average business. Over the past few years, state AGs have taken an increasingly active role in privacy and data security matters, using their broad consumer protection authority to enforce rapidly evolving state laws and investigate data security lapses. Even more recently, state AGs have begun to step out of their typical enforcement roles to pursue policy and legislative initiatives.</p><p>Despite signs of momentum, Congress is unlikely to pass any major new national cybersecurity legislation this election year. Companies are thus likely looking at another year where privacy and data security enforcement remains largely in the hands of state AGs. Here are three trends to watch out for in 2020.</p><p>More AG notification laws.</p><p>In order to wield their consumer protection authority, state AGs need to keep abreast of data breaches. It's no surprise that in 2019 we saw several states pass or expand legislation requiring that state AGs be notified after a cybersecurity incident (including Massachusetts, New York, Arkansas, Illinois, Oregon, Texas, and Washington). We predict this trend will continue in 2020.</p><p>Currently, upwards of twenty-five states require<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>Including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.</p></bodyText></footnote> some form of AG notification after a breach. Some notification statutes are triggered by the number of residents affected (as few as 250 residents in South Dakota, and as many as 1,000 in Arizona), whereas others require disclosure no matter the size of the breach. The required contents of these notification can vary as well. For instance, in 2019 Massachusetts expanded its AG notification law to require that companies disclose:</p><p> A detailed description of the nature and circumstances of the breach;The number of Massachusetts residents affected;The person responsible for the incident, if known;The type of personal information compromised, including, but not limited to: Social Security numberDriver's license numberFinancial account numberCredit or debit card numberor other data; Whether the company maintains a written information security program;All the steps the company has taken or plans to take relating to the incident, including updating the written information security program;Whether a report has been made to law enforcement and whether law enforcement is investigating the incident; andWhere applicable, certification of credit monitoring services pursuant to Chapter 93H, section 3A.</p><p>AG notifications add another layer of complexity to your breach response. If you experience a breach, you will need to track the relevant deadlines, and draft and send a notification that meets the statutory requirements applicable to your state. Depending on the state, the AG may also have some law-enforcement responsibility related to data breaches, meaning you could be looking at an investigation if your breach is severe.</p><p>Because state laws in this area are constantly changing, it is important to stay current on breach notification laws in your state(s).</p><p>Ramping up the pressure on federal regulators.</p><p>In 2019, AGs in several states ramped up the pressure on federal regulators to police big tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Google. Over the last few years, there has been a growing feeling in many quarters that the federal government has adopted a laissez faire (and overly business-friendly) attitude toward consumer data privacy. Increasingly, state AGs and other state regulators are picking up the perceived slack at the federal level.</p><p>For example, in June, nine state AGs and the District of Columbia sued to block the T-Mobile/Sprint merger, a move that later gained support from FTC and DOJ. In July, thirty-nine state AGs signed onto a letter requesting that the FTC take several steps to better protect consumer privacy. More recently, on September 6, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) announced that a bipartisan coalition that would be investigating whether Facebook \"may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising.\" And on September 10, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) announced that a bipartisan coalition of 50 attorneys general investigating Google's alleged market power in search and digital advertising as well as potential abuses of consumer privacy.</p><p>Pressure from state AGs throughout 2019 likely contributed to the FTC's record-breaking $5 billion settlement with Facebook, its $175 million settlement with Google's YouTube (where the FTC was joined by New York Attorney General's Office), and DOJ's recent announcement that it was investigating all four big tech giants, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon. While Congress is unlikely to make any big legislative moves during an election year, we expect that won't stop state AGs from continuing to turn up the pressure in 2020.</p><p>Increased power to state AGs.</p><p>Finally, watch out for state laws that increase AGs' roles in data privacy and security enforcement. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a case in point. The law, which became effective January 1, 2020, authorizes the California attorney general's office to draft implementing regulations and bring enforcement actions. In October 2019, California AG Xavier Becerra released the long-awaited draft regulations. Enforcement will begin six months after the regulations are finalized or on July 1, 2020, whichever comes first. We expect that other states will follow California's example and give their AGs greater privacy watchdog power.</p><p>Another such example is the federal Mind Your Business Act, which was introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) in October 2019. The Act allows state AGs to bring a civil action on behalf of residents if they have reason to believe residents' interests \"[have] been or [are] being threatened or adversely affected\" by a practice that violates the FTC regulations. Although the Act is unlikely to become law, it is indicative of the trend toward giving AGs greater enforcement tools</p><p>To view Foley Hoag's Security, Privacy and The Law Blog please click  here</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

And then, for whatever reason, people started making Top 11 lists. I won't pretend to understand the origins of this internet phenomenon (other than to assume that some influential list-maker had an obsession with prime numbers), but I am not one to buck a trend. So, to keep this Year in Preview collection at the cutting edge of internet culture, I present this list of the Top 11 CCPA Developments to Watch Out for in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Overview of the California Consumer Privacy Act</p><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") is a landmark information privacy law enacted in late 2018. The Act is a big deal for businesses that collect consumers' personal information, for two main reasons. First, the CCPA applies to a wide range of businesses across the country. It covers for-profit entities that \"do business\" in California and meet certain revenue or data-collection criteria. That means a business located in another state that sells products or provides services to California residents through the internet may have to comply with the CCPA. Second, the CCPA gives California residents (known as \"consumers\" under the law) rights to their personal information that are unprecedented in the United States. Consumers have the right to know certain information about how their data is collected, used, and shared; the right to delete their information in some circumstances; and the right to opt-out from the sale of their personal information. Businesses are required to make certain disclosures related to these rights and to establish processes for responding to consumer requests to exercise their rights.</p><p>The CCPA goes into effect on January 1, 2020, and California's Attorney General has not yet promulgated final regulations to implement the law. The AG cannot enforce the law until six months after the regulations go into effect, or July 1, 2020 (whichever comes first). As of the date of this writing, there is still significant uncertainty along several fronts about what businesses need to do to comply with the law. This list touches on that uncertainty and highlights some other aspects of the CCPA to consider heading into 2020.</p><p>11. Will the Attorney General Enforce Non-Compliance that Occurred Between January and July?</p><p>Section 1798.185 of the CCPA prohibits the Attorney General from bringing \"an enforcement action . . . until six months after the publication of the final regulations issued pursuant to this section or July 1, 2020, whichever is sooner.\" While this clause makes clear that we won't see any CCPA enforcement actions until the latter half of 2020, it leaves ambiguous whether those enforcement actions may cover conduct that occurred in the first half of the year. This could turn out to be an especially important ambiguity for companies that fail to comply with the Act on January 1. If the Attorney General brings an enforcement action against such a business, the business might be able to successfully argue that 1798.185 bars the action because the alleged non-compliance occurred before the July 1 enforcement date. Or, a court could take the position that the legislature intended to give businesses a six-month transition period during which non-compliance will not later be penalized.</p><p>10. Will California Receive \"Adequate\" Status Under the GDPR?</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") is the European Union's data privacy law, and the CCPA is often compared to it. Both the GDPR and CCPA grant similar rights to individuals, but also contain significant differences. One key difference is that the GDPR restricts the transfer from a country within the European Economic Area to an outside country. Such transfers must be made subject to a method approved by European data privacy regulators, ostensibly to protect data subjects' privacy.</p><p>One approved mechanism for transferring data is an adequacy decision. Under this mechanism, the GDPR permits cross-border data transfers when the European Commission has determined that the receiving country has an adequate data privacy regulatory regime. Very few countries have received such status.</p><p>There is some speculation that the CCPA may allow California to receive an adequacy determination, though it is far from certain that the state would meet the requisite criteria. If, however, California does receive an adequacy determination under the GDPR, it would mean that businesses in California would have an easier time receiving data transfers from the EEA than would businesses in the rest of the country. That advantage could become even more pronounced because the Court of Justice of the European Union is currently considering a case that may invalidate two of the mechanisms for transferring data from the EEA to the U.S. currently in use: standard contractual clauses and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.</p><p>9. What Does it Mean to \"Sell\" Personal Information?</p><p>The CCPA defines the term \"sale\" or \"sell\" broadly - very broadly. Any transfer of personal information from a business to a third party \"for monetary or other valuable consideration\" counts as a sale. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1798.140(t). Since nearly all business relationships involve monetary or \"other valuable\" consideration (the point of establishing a business relationship is usually to make money), nearly every transfer of personal information between businesses is arguably a sale. Yet, the CCPA's definition of \"sale\" certainly has its outer boundaries.</p><p>One key question regarding those boundaries is how they relate to online advertising. The working assumption is that when a content publisher (such as a streaming video platform) shares a user's personal information with an advertising network and the network uses that information to display targeted ads, the content publisher has \"sold\" the personal information under the CCPA. But the ad-tech industry is complex, and not all transfers of personal information involved in the delivery of online advertisements necessarily constitute a sale; there is already disagreement about how the definition of \"sale\" applies to online advertising.</p><p>8. Will the IAB's CCPA Framework Withstand Regulatory Scrutiny?</p><p>The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), a digital-ad industry group, has created a unique mechanism for the adtech industry to comply with consumers' right to opt out from the sale of their personal information under the CCPA. The IAB's CCPA Compliance Framework works like this:</p><p>When a consumer opts out, the content publisher sends a digital signal to notify all of the downstream businesses associated with their advertising platform that the consumer has opted out. That signal triggers a series of contractual arrangements that turn the adtech businesses into \"service providers\" to the content publisher. Under the CCPA, information shared between a business and service provider is not a sale, but there are restrictions surrounding how such information can be used by the service provider.</p><p>The IAB Framework calls the relationship between the content publisher and the adtech business a \"Limited Service Provider\" relationship. The idea is that when a consumer opts out from the sale of their information, the adtech company who still wants to display ads to the consumer becomes a service provider to the content publisher - but only for the purpose of displaying ads to that particular consumer. In other words, the service-provider relationship is limited to a single advertising transaction or series of transactions affecting a single consumer. The CCPA does not contemplate this type of relationship, and it is unclear how it will be viewed by the Attorney General. If the Attorney General decides that service provider relationships can't be tailored to specific transactions, then the digital ad industry may be in for a significant disruption.</p><p>7. What Does it Mean to \"Do Business\" in California?</p><p>The CCPA applies to a company that meets certain criteria and \"does business\" in California. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1798.140(c). Neither the CCPA nor the Attorney General's draft regulations define the term \"does business,\" so some companies are left with uncertainty. Stakeholders should pay close attention to any enforcement actions in 2020 that involve a company with no physical presence in California but that sells products to consumers in the state. The working assumption is that the Act applies to such companies, in part because California legal provisions contain broad definitions of what it means to \"do business\" in the state. But, early precedent on the issue will become important to determining how much contact with the state is enough to \"do business\" for future, closer cases.</p><p>6. What Industry Best Practices will Emerge?</p><p>One of the questions I sometimes get from clients about the CCPA is \"what is everyone else doing?\" It's a difficult question to answer because everyone is doing things differently. Lawyers (outside counsel, inside counsel, and interest group lawyers) have varying interpretations of the law and the regulations, and the CCPA interacts differently with different business and data-use models. As the Attorney General finalizes the regulations and the law goes into effect and starts getting enforced, best practices for complying with the CCPA will emerge across affected industries. Companies should pay particular attention to how CCPA disclosures in privacy policies read, how webforms for responding to consumer rights look, and whether their competitors have decided to extend CCPA rights to users outside of California.</p><p>5. Will Other States Play Copycat?</p><p>The CCPA is a big deal because California is the largest economy in the country and because the Act applies to a substantial percentage of big businesses that aren't physically located in the state. But California is just one state. There are 49 others - plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories - that have an interest in protecting their residents' information privacy. It would take just one state to enact a more restrictive information privacy law than the CCPA to create a new national standard, at least for businesses that collect personal information from residents across the country. For example, New York considered a bill earlier this year that would have created more robust privacy protections than the CCPA offers. Will another state steal California's thunder in 2020? And if one does . . .</p><p>4. Will the Feds Step Up?</p><p>Calls for comprehensive federal information privacy regulation have intensified since the passage of the CCPA. Many of these calls have come from a surprising source: Big tech companies. Companies are concerned with the prospect of having to comply with 50 (+!) sets of data privacy regulations, and would rather deal with one federal law that preempts more restrictive state laws. The House and the Senate are busy with other things right now, but a deal on federal privacy regulation could be possible in 2020 after the November election while Congress is in a \"lame duck\" session.</p><p>3. How Many Consumers will Exercise their CCPA Rights?</p><p>Another question that I sometimes get is whether a company should use manual or automated processes to respond to requests from consumers to exercise their CCPA rights. The right approach depends on a company's resources, technical capabilities, and the number of consumers from whom it collects personal information. The answer also depends on how many consumers will exercise their rights - especially the Right to Know and Right to Delete, both of which require locating and either deleting or disclosing information requested by the consumer.</p><p>This is a difficult one to predict. There are 40 million people in California, and if a business chooses to extend CCPA rights to its users across the country, over 300 million in the U.S. Companies with large volumes of users may be inundated with requests when the law goes into effect on New Year's Day 2020; but requests may taper off thereafter.</p><p>Interestingly, the draft regulations require companies that collect personal information from over 4,000,000 consumers to annually compile and disclose statistics about how many requests they receive. By December 31, 2020, we might actually have a good idea of how many consumers chose to exercise their new rights under the CCPA in 2020.</p><p>2. Will the Legislature Let Key CCPA Amendments Sunset?</p><p>California's legislature passed the CCPA with some haste in 2018. A CCPA-like ballot measure looked likely to pass in the November election, but at the eleventh hour the measure's sponsor - Californians for Consumer Privacy - struck a deal with the legislature to pull the ballot measure in exchange for the state enacting the CCPA. The last-minute deal resulted in a law with more than a few inconsistencies, ambiguities, and uncertainties that needed subsequent clarification. The legislature accordingly amended the CCPA several times in 2019. Most notably, California amended the Act to exempt information collected by businesses from employees and to exempt information collected in a business-to-business context. However, these amendments are scheduled to sunset on January 1, 2021. Will the legislature extend the exemptions, or decide that CCPA rights should apply to employees and to business-to-business relationships?</p><p>1.

Of the many facets that can be considered as consumer welfare, changes in price and output are the easiest to measure and have, therefore, traditionally been the de facto benchmark for assessing anticompetitiveness. There are two current trends disrupting this: first, a debate as to whether other elements of consumer welfare should play a greater role, particularly treatment of customers' data; and second, the importance of big data in maintaining competitive markets. These trends are reflected in the growing regulatory scrutiny of big tech firms, the focus of antitrust regulators on the digital economy and, in the European Union in particular, the May 2018 implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This chapter provides an overview of the current activities of the EU and US regulators in cases at the intersection of competition law and data issues. Many of the developments can be seen in the regulators' enforcement of the merger control laws, but there have also been significant developments in the antitrust arena more broadly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Merger control</p><p>The European Commission (EC) has the ability to review mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures between companies that have revenues in the European Union above certain thresholds. The EC has the power to require remedies to address any anticompetitive effects, or in the absence of suitable remedies, prohibit transactions. Similarly, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) can review transactions satisfying certain asset and turnover thresholds, with the power to seek a court injunction (or agree to modifications of transactions) where any competition concerns arise.</p><p>In recent years, the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have routinely been considering big data in merger reviews, analysing it from two main angles. First, an approach adopted by both the EC and the DOJ/FTC: whether bringing together two companies with significant data sets could result in an excessively strong market position, referred to as a 'horizontal' issue in antitrust parlance as the consolidation is at the same level of the value chain. Second, an issue investigated more enthusiastically by the EC than the US authorities, is whether a merged entity could and would withhold access to its data to the detriment of rivals and effective competition, known as a 'vertical' issue, as one party is upstream of the other in the value chain. Both of these issues can be seen in a number of high-profile investigations, including in , and .</p><p>In addition, the antitrust authorities routinely consider the implications of a merged entity obtaining confidential information about its competitors when it is acquiring a supplier or customer of its competitors, and often imposes confidentiality obligations to resolve these concerns. These remedies are based on well-established principles and not related to 'big data', and so are not discussed further here.</p><p>Data-set combinations</p><p>As noted above, both EU and US authorities have investigated whether merging parties could derive an anticompetitive level of market power as a result of combining their data sets. In recent years, despite some lengthy investigations, neither authority has imposed antitrust remedies for an amalgamation of big data, generally relying on the fact that the data sets were not unique. In both <footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>Case M.7217 - , 3 October 2014, ().</p></bodyText></footnote> and <footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>Case M.8124 - , 6 December 2016, ().</p></bodyText></footnote> the EC dismissed the fact that any data combination would have such adverse effects, on the grounds that large amounts of other internet user data would remain available to competitors outside the exclusive control of Facebook and Microsoft respectively. <footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>, [184]-[189].</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>In , the EC specifically assessed whether the merged entity could use WhatsApp user data in conjunction with Facebook data to increase its ability to compete in the advertising market. This was rejected because such conduct would have required a change in WhatsApp's privacy policy (potentially leading to consumers changing to alternative providers), and even if Facebook were capable of automatically matching users' WhatsApp and Facebook profiles (a capability confirmed in the EC's subsequent procedural investigation),<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>In May 2017, the EC fined Facebook 110 million for providing false and misleading information as part of its takeover of WhatsApp, when it incorrectly claimed that it was technically unable to match users' Facebook and WhatsApp accounts. This was in fact a technical possibility of which Facebook staff were aware at the time of the takeover. See 'Mergers: Commission fines Facebook 110 million for providing misleading information about WhatsApp takeover', EC Press Release, 18 May 2017 (available at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1369_en.htm\">https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1369_en.htm</url>).</p></bodyText></footnote> there would be no anticompetitive harm in the advertising market as a result.</p><p>The FTC also approved the merger without raising competition concerns, but instead threatened future action if Facebook did not live up to its consumer protection commitments with the aim of protecting the privacy of WhatsApp user data.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>Letter to WhatsApp from the FTC 2-3, 10 April 2014 (warning about misuse of personal data).</p></bodyText></footnote> A subsequent change in WhatsApp's privacy policy in 2016 (which incidentally also triggered the European Union's procedural fine for providing false information during its investigation) was subsequently confirmed as subject to review by the FTC;<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>Letter from Jah-Juin 'Jared' Ho, Division of Privacy and Identity Protection at the FTC to Seventeen Consumer Privacy Groups, 29 September 2016.</p></bodyText></footnote> however, no enforcement appears to have taken place.</p><p>In more recent cases, the authorities have started to evaluate the effects of combining data sets using the industry recognised metrics known as the 'four Vs': the variety of data; the velocity at which the data is collected; the volume of data in the set; and the value of the data. These criteria are used to establish whether the data sets changing hands can be considered 'unique' and therefore conferring a 'data advantage'. This appears to be the evolving basis for the legal test of whether data-set combinations have the potential to be anticompetitive. It is predicated on the basis that a large data set could translate into market power. In comparison, a company's past performance in the market (measured by the proportion of customers or share of the total value of sales in the market) has traditionally been used as a benchmark for assessing whether the company has market power. This leap, from assessing market power based on past performance to assessing it based on the ability to monetise a data set, represents a significant conceptual shift.</p><p>This analysis was first used by the EC in its September 2018 decision, where it recognised the increasingly important role of user data in the digital music industry.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote7\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p>Case M.8788 - , 6 September 2018; (), section 6.6.</p></bodyText></footnote> After an in-depth investigation, the EC found that the transaction was not likely to result in anti-\u00adcompetitive harm given the multiple alternative providers of data with comparable features when assessed against the four Vs.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote8\"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p>, [179].</p></bodyText></footnote> This developing test for establishing harm can also be seen in US decisional practice. The lack of uniqueness of a data set was a key consideration in the FTC's review of . Parties opposed to the acquisition were vocal in their allegations that the incremental addition of data about Whole Foods's customers to Amazon's existing data reserves would result in further monopolisation of markets in which Amazon is active. This theory was, however, rejected by the FTC, which found that the acquisition would not provide Amazon with data that would give it a strong competitive advantage as it was neither unique to Whole Foods nor particularly meaningful in the competition between Amazon and other retailers, such as Walmart.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote9\"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>D Bruce Hoffman, Antitrust in the Financial Sector, Concurrences, 2 May 2018 (available at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1408262/hoffman_-_antitrust_in_the_financial_sector_5-2-18.pdf\">https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1408262/hoffman_-_antitrust_in_the_financial_sector_5-2-18.pdf</url>).</p></bodyText></footnote> Bruce Hoffman, Director of the Bureau of Competition at the FTC, supported a focus on a qualitative rather than quantitative analysis of data noting that, when dealing with issues of 'big data' in mergers, 'the relevant question for antitrust is whether the data of the two firms is a key differentiator and whether other firms that compete with them cannot replace the competition that would be lost from the merger.'<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote10\"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p>ibid.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>In the United States, despite the DC District Court's preliminary injunction stopping the merger in 2008 on the grounds that the need for large data sets to compete created significant barriers to entry,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote11\"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p>, No. 08-2043 (RMC), ECF No. 86, Memorandum Opinion (DD 2009).</p></bodyText></footnote> regulators have generally expressed more scepticism around the possibility for anticompetitive harm to arise from data-set combinations. The DOJ, for instance, chose to close its 2010 investigation into the advertising agreement between Microsoft and Yahoo! Inc, despite the fact that such agreement would provide Microsoft with a larger pool of data, allowing it to enhance its performance of various advertising activities and impose competitive pressure in the market. In the DOJ's view, the transaction was 'not likely to cause harm'.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote12\"/><label>12</label><bodyText><p>'Statement of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division on Its Decision to Close Its Investigation of the Internet Search and Paid Search Advertising Agreement Between Microsoft Corporation and Yahoo!

Interestingly, however, the FTC noted that, even if Google were to breach such contracts: 'the evidence does not support the conclusion that the aggregation of consumer or competitive information accessible to Google as a result of its acquisition of DoubleClick is likely to confer market power,' since sensitive information, such as pricing data, was little in volume and lacked the completeness to provide Google with any competitive advantage. Much of the data in question was also already available to Google as well as to Google's competitors, thereby allowing them to compete effectively.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote16\"/><label>16</label><bodyText><p>St Fed Trade Commission Concerning , FTC File No. 071-0170, at 12-13, 3.

The assessment of vertical data concerns follows a relatively well-established legal template and does not generally involve novel legal concepts.

Data was first considered in an abuse of dominance context in IMS Health. IMS generated reports of regional sales data of pharmaceutical products and had refused to license the structure in which this data was presented to its competitor (NDC), arguing that it was protected by copyright. The Commission considered IMS had abused a dominant position and ordered IMS Health to grant a licence to use the structure to all its competitors. This case came to the European Court of Justice in 2004; the Court applied the established legal principle of 'essential facilities', normally applied to infrastructure such as ports or telecom networks, namely whether a certain structure is indispensable for a potential competitor to gain access to a market. The Court indeed found that refusing access to a data set could be an abuse of dominance based on the following three limbs: NDC intended to offer new products for which there was consumer demand; IMS's refusal to allow access was not objectively justified; and IMS's refusal effectively eliminated all competition in the relevant market.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote19\"/><label>19</label><bodyText><p>Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-418/01,, 29 April 2004, [52].</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Interestingly, there has been little development of the case law in the European Union for data-related abuses of dominance since IMS Health.

The FCO found that by making such data collection a condition of signing up to its services, Facebook had committed an 'exploitative abuse' under German competition law, as a result of 'inappropriate contractual terms and conditions'. According to Andreas Mundt, president of the FCO: 'the combination of data sources substantially contributed to the fact that Facebook was able to build a unique database for each individual user and thus to gain market power.'<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote26\"/><label>26</label><bodyText><p>ibid.</p></bodyText></footnote>Facebook's conduct, therefore, resulted in a detriment to consumers, as well as to competitors who were unable to access such a broad volume of data.

He warned that, while these issues are being \"debate[d],\" China and other countries are working to launch similar payment systems. He argued that since Libra would be backed by U.S. dollars, it would \"extend\" U.S. financial leadership. He also addressed several concerns, assuring the legislators that:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> a recent white paper co-authored by Facebook (see previous coverage) was intended to start a dialogue with financial experts and regulators, rather than serve as the \"final word\";Facebook does not intend to \"circumvent\" regulators; andthe intended purpose of Libra is to provide for the transfer of money through an online payment system, not to be a replacement for sovereign currency.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg also affirmed Facebook's commitment to preventing discrimination among Facebook's advertisers. To \"combat[]\" discrimination, he stated, Facebook has made specific changes to policies in order to prevent discriminatory advertisement targeting. For example, Facebook banned the use of age, gender or zip codes in housing and credit advertisements.</p><p>Committee members at the hearing discussed several bills concerning technology and finance related to issues raised by the testimony. These included:</p><p> H.R. Draft \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act\" would prohibit large platform utilities (i.e., Facebook) from (i) being authorized as, or affiliating with, a U.S. financial institution or (ii) operating a digital asset that is intended to be \"widely used\" as a method for exchange, pursuant to the Federal Reserve.H.R. Draft \"Stablecoins Are Securities Act of 2019\" would make clear that a managed stablecoin is subject to the same securities laws' requirements as other securities that are meant to protect investors, such as disclosure, antifraud and conflicts of interest.H.R. Draft \"Bill to Prohibit the Listing of Certain Securities\" would limit issuers of stablecoins access to capital markets prohibiting certain trading on U.S. national securities exchanges.H.R. Draft \"Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data\" would create more \"transparency\" on how consumer data is collected by requiring commercial data operators to disclose (i) the type of user data collected, (ii) an examination of how valuable the user data is and (iii) third-party contracts involving the collection of the data. H.R. Draft \"Diverse Asset Managers Act\" would require SEC registrants to (i) consider at least one \"diverse\" asset manager when seeking asset management services and (ii) report to the SEC the extent to which diverse asset managers are used.</p><p>Commentary</p><p>Steven Lofchie</p><p>Facebook's attempted entry into the digital currency market accelerated the inevitable: Congress and the financial regulators are more closely scrutinizing the entry of technology firms into the financial markets. What was not inevitable was Congressional overreaction. While it now seems universal practice to refer to Libra as a Stablecoin, it is not: it is an asset-backed coin (try \"ABCoin\"). Because the managers of Libra would have had the ability to shift the assets supporting Libra, Libra is not stable. Because of the management of the underlying assets backing the product, Libra almost certainly would have been a \"security,\" at least in the absence of an exemption, and therefore, it is not necessary to amend the securities laws to that end.</p><p>A true Stablecoin, whether backed by the dollar or another currency (or even a pool of currencies) may be issued as a custodial receipt that is not a security, and need not be regulated as a security. It would thus be a shame if such Stablecoins, which may very well provide an attractive alternative to other payment methods, were made impossible because of an overbroad reaction to Libra.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg is absolutely correct that the United States benefits if a global stablecoin backed by the dollar were to emerge. Facebook's principal mistake, which arguably reflects a certain lack of sophisticated understanding of financial regulation, was to go forward with a managed ABCoin, rather than a true Stablecoin.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Members of both parties demanded to know why a company with massive market power and a track record of scandals should be trusted with such a far-reaching project, given the potential for fraud, abuse and criminal activity.</p><p>\"Facebook is dangerous,\" asserted Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's senior Democrat. Like a toddler playing with matches, \"Facebook has burned down the house over and over,\" he told Marcus. \"Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money?\"</p><p>Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said \"the core issue here is trust.\" Users won't be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for Libra, McSally said.</p><p>\"Arizonans will be more likely to be scammed\" using the currency, she said.</p><p>The litany of criticism came as Congress began two days of hearings on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra. Meanwhile, a House Judiciary subcommittee extended its bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>On the defensive from bursts of aggressive questioning, Facebook's Marcus indicated the currency plan is a work in progress.</p><p>\"We will take the time\" to ensure the network won't be open to use by criminals and illicit activity like money laundering and financial fraud. \"We hope that we'll avoid conflicts of interest. We have a lot of work to do,\" Marcus said.</p><p>He said the new venture would be headquartered in Switzerland, not to avoid oversight but because the country is a recognized international financial center.</p><p>The grilling followed a series of negative comments and warnings about the Libra plan in recent days from President Donald Trump, his treasury secretary and the head of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>But some senators emphasized the potential positive benefits of Facebook's plan, meant to bring money transacting at low cost to millions around the globe who don't have bank accounts. Facebook had its strong defenders of the project, too, on the panel.</p><p>\"To strangle this baby in the crib is wildly premature,\" said Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.</p><p>In that vein, Marcus said Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is to be a blend of multiple currencies, so that its value will fluctuate in any given local currency. Because Libra will be backed by a reserve, and because the group of companies managing it will encourage a competitive system of exchanges, the project leaders say, \"anyone with Libra has a high degree of assurance they can sell it for local (sovereign) currency based on an exchange rate.\"</p><p>Promising low fees, the new currency system could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard, to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from it, the company says.</p><p>Senators demanded to know exactly what that separation will entail.</p><p>\"Facebook isn't a company; it's a country,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. Kennedy and other conservative senators took the occasion to air long-standing grievances against Facebook, Twitter and Google for a perceived bias against conservative views.</p><p>Facebook's currency proposal has also faced heavy skepticism from the Trump administration.</p><p>Trump tweeted last week that the new currency, Libra, \"will have little standing or dependability.\" Both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell have expressed serious concerns recently that Libra could be used for illicit activity.</p><p>The Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\" Mnuchin told reporters at the White House on Monday. \"This is indeed a national security issue.\"</p><p>Also Tuesday, across the Capitol in the House, the chairman of a Judiciary Committee panel investigating the market power of big tech companies said Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed them to regulate themselves. That enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said at the start of a hearing.</p><p>\"The internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship,\" he said.</p><p>As concerns have mounted over data privacy and market dominance of Big Tech, an increasing number of lawmakers from both parties are calling for tighter regulation of customarily free-wheeling companies or even breaking them up.

The nominees are Joseph Simons (Chairman Designate), Christine Wilson, Noah Phillips and Rohit Chopra. The hearing covered a range of antitrust and consumer protection issues before, or potentially before, the Commission, including healthcare competition and pharmaceutical pricing; competition in technology and telecommunications sectors; industry concentration; cybersecurity breaches and privacy; and online or telemarketing deception and scams.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The general tone of the hearing was positive. No member of the Commerce Committee raised concerns with any specific nominee or suggested opposition. Chairman John Thune (R-SD) indicated his intention to seek a floor vote quickly on the nominees. The Committee shortened the period for additional written questions from members to one week, from the typical two weeks. Senator Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) indicated that the chair hopes to schedule the nominees for a Committee vote in the Commerce Committee's next executive session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A detailed summary of the hearing is linked below, along with links to member opening statements and witness testimony.</p><p>Links to Written Statements and Testimony</p><p> Chairman John Thune (R-SD)Ranking Member Bill Nelson (D-FL)Nominees: Joseph Simons (Chairman Designate), Rohit Chopra, Noah Phillips, Christine Wilson</p><p>Opening Statements</p><p>Chairman John Thune (R-SD) said he has appreciated the FTC's increased focus on the technology sector and that he hopes the agency will continue that focus. Ranking Member Bill Nelson (D-FL) said he hopes the FTC will continue to work in a bipartisan and independent manner.</p><p> Introductions. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced Joseph Simons, the nominee for FTC Chairman. He said the FTC will be facing complex challenges in the next few years and that Mr. Simons is \"just the man this moment requires.\" Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced Noah Phillips, formerly of his staff. He said Mr. Phillips is an expert in IP, antitrust and technical issues, and has a gift for building consensus across the aisle. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) introduced Christine Wilson. She said Ms. Wilson is motivated by her view that competition is the best protection for consumers and the strongest prescription for a robust economy.Nominee Opening Statements. Mr. Simons said that he intends to continue to lead the FTC in a bipartisan way. He said the agency will focus on protecting and improving consumer welfare. Ms. Wilson said that the FTC should wield its authority appropriately and cautioned against the commission trading its role as referee in the market for the role of manager or star player. Mr. Phillips said in his opening statement that he believes the mission of the FTC is to protect consumers and competition, maintain predictability, and keep abreast of advancements in technology. Mr. Chopra said in his opening statement that he sees challenges ahead for the FTC in handling data breaches, sophisticated scams targeting seniors and veterans, and a large volume of upcoming M&amp;A activity. He said it is the FTC's responsibility to protect consumers as well as honest businesses.</p><p>Question and Answer</p><p>The hearing covered the FTC's enforcement priorities and its antitrust and consumer protection missions.</p><p>Enforcement Priorities</p><p> Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) asked how the commission will prioritize all of the issues currently pending. Mr. Simons said he intends to focus resources on areas where the potential for harm is the greatest. Senator Udall asked Mr. Simons for several commitments. Mr. Simons agreed to examine the FTC's budget and identify any concerns for the committee; he also agreed to examine the issue of bots in public comment systems, false labeling of sports equipment, and internet connectivity of children's toys. Mr. Chopra said the collection of data on children and service members warrants very specific attention. Mr. Phillips said consumer education is a crucial tool to get the word out to parents about data collection risks. Senator Udall said he hopes the FTC will work with state attorneys general to amplify that message.Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) asked if merger enforcement should be a priority of the FTC. Mr. Chopra said there are barriers to entry in many industries, and that it is very important that the commission is sufficiently flexible to adapt its resources to keep up with the enforcement challenges presented by rapidly changing markets.</p><p>Antitrust</p><p> Injunction Standard. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) mentioned his legislation, the SMARTER Act, which would align the standards that the DOJ and FTC must meet to obtain preliminary injunctions and which would require the FTC to litigate merger cases in federal court (rather than in administrative proceedings). He asked the nominees if there is any good reason for different injunction standards to govern DOJ and FTC merger challenges, and if they would ever authorize the filing of an administrative complaint without seeking a preliminary injunction in federal court. Mr. Chopra said he believes market participants should not have to navigate multiple standards whenever possible, but one concern is the overall speed of the proceedings. Mr. Phillips said he does not believe there is any good reason to have different standards. Ms. Wilson said she believes businesses should have predictability and clarity when considering potential transactions, and that there is no good reason for different standards. She said she would be inclined to seek a preliminary injunction in federal court for unconsummated mergers. Mr. Simons said he believes in practice that the two standards lead to the same results, but agrees that that should be made more clear. He said litigation should be in federal court and there should only be one bite at the apple. Senator Lee said he was encouraged by those comments and that the fate of a litigant should not be determined by a coin toss determining which agency reviews the merger.Competition in Technology Sector. Senator Thune (R-SD) asked about the state of competition in the technology sector. Mr. Simons said big is not necessarily good or bad, but he has concerns that big and influential companies could use anticompetitive means to stay big. Ms. Wilson said she believes the antitrust laws as written are sufficiently broad and flexible to adapt to new technology. Mr. Phillips said technology companies have a large impact on our lives, and he sees the FTC playing a role in ensuring competition. Mr. Chopra said large tech companies compete not only with each other but with several other sectors of the economy also, and that creates interesting challenges for the Commission.<br/> Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) asked about the scope and size of big tech and how the FTC should approach the rapid growth. Mr. Simons said he believes the sectors most likely to face antitrust problems are those in which firms have the most market power, and he intends to pay particular attention to those areas.Competition in the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industries. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) questioned the nominees about drug pricing and whether they agree the FTC needs to vigorously enforce against anticompetitive conduct in the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Simons said he is very concerned about drug pricing and would like to explore the possibility of creating a task force that could monitor drug price increases and identify cases where anticompetitive conduct has played a role. Mr. Chopra said the FTC needs to focus on sectors in which enforcement can have the greatest effect on consumer pocketbooks, and the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries must be a top priority.<br/> Senator Capito (R-WV) asked the nominees about prescription drug pricing and consolidation in the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) industry. She raised concerns about retail competition in the healthcare industry and asked how the FTC will deal with these issues. Mr. Simons said he strongly agrees with that concern and hopes to establish a program to retrospectively examine mergers and determine if past enforcement has been effective. He said the healthcare industry may be part of that initiative. Mr. Phillips said the FTC should be focusing on this issue because healthcare costs may be the number one issue for many American households. Ms. Wilson said this is an area where the FTC has spent a lot of time, and she expects they will continue to do so.<br/> Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) asked Ms. Wilson about protecting consumers in the face of consolidating healthcare markets. In particular, he raised concerns about PBMs lacking transparency and abusing market leverage. He asked what role transparency should play in ensuring competition in the pharmaceutical segment. Ms. Wilson said she firmly believes transparency is crucial for free and efficient markets. As to PBMs, she agreed with Mr. Simons that merger retrospectives would be important to determine whether the FTC has achieved the right enforcement balance. Senator Wicker said that pharmacists are often frustrated by the regulatory burdens placed on them.<br/> Senator Klobuchar (D-MN) asked about reverse paymentsi.e., where a branded pharmaceutical supplier is alleged to have paid a generic company to drop a patent challenge and stay out of the marketand pointed out that pharmaceutical prices have continued to rise. Mr. Phillips said the FTC has a long bipartisan tradition of policing anticompetitive actions in the pharmaceutical industry and said he looks forward to continued FTC focus there.Competition in the Telecommunications Sector. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) read a statement from FTC Commissioner Terrell McSweeny about gaps in the FTC's authority and expertise in the telecommunications sector over privacy and data security. Mr. Chopra said he shares the concerns Commissioner McSweeny raises. Mr. Simons said he believes if the FTC's authority to enforce in this sector is restored, the FTC will be a vigorous enforcer. Senator Markey said the FTC lacks sufficient rulemaking authority in this area; Mr. Simons said the FTC and FCC both have rulemaking authority but of different types. Mr. Simons said that he would like to consult with the FTC's general counsel's office before reaching firm conclusions regarding these issues.Competition in Agriculture. Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) asked about concentration in the agricultural industry. Mr. Simons said he would likely include agriculture in the merger retrospective program. Senator Tester asked if the review could affect the Syngenta/ChemChina merger. Mr. Simons said a retrospective would have implications for every merger going forward, but that generally past mergers are a done deal. The other nominees agreed.Competition in the Airline Industry. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) expressed concerns about the airline industry. He said he hopes the commissioners will use their platform and bully pulpit to advocate for competition there, even if the FTC lacks jurisdiction. Mr. Phillips said he would like to make the Commission a resource for other agencies seeking expertise on the topic. Senator Blumenthal said beyond the FTC being a resource, he would like to see it \"be a champion.\"</p><p>Consumer Protection</p><p> Consumer Protection Policy. Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV) asked for all nominees to make a commitment that the FTC will be an active consumer protection agency on their watch. Each of the nominees agreed. Senator Cortez-Masto asked what they see as the biggest challenge the commission will face. Mr. Simons said data breaches, and Ms. Wilson agreed. Mr. Phillips agreed as well, but added that those topics should not distract from the bread-and-butter issues of the agency like protecting children and the elderly. Mr. Chopra said the FTC should make enforcement against credit reporting agency misconduct a paramount priority.Data Protection and Data Breaches. Senator Blumenthal (D-CT) inquired about protecting consumer data in cyber breaches. Each of the nominees expressed concerns about whether the FTC has sufficient authority to create incentives for companies to protect consumer data.<br/> Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) asked whether there should be more rigorous guidelines regarding notification about data breaches and whether, for example, waiting five weeks to disclose a breach was too long. Mr. Simons said it was worth examining the possibility of new guidelines, but that he does not yet have a good basis to reach a conclusion on whether five weeks is too long. Mr. Chopra said as a general matter and not specific to any one case, several weeks does not sound fast enough to him. Mr. Phillips said data breach notifications raise serious issues that he is looking forward to working on. Ms. Wilson agreed this area raises serious issues and said she anticipates the FTC will spend a great deal of time on these questions.Credit Reporting. Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) asked the nominees if they believe the FTC has the authority to do more in the credit reporting industry. Each of the nominees said they were interested in exploring whether the commission would benefit from more authority. Mr. Chopra said the industry is an example of one where consumers cannot vote with their feet and the commission needs to \"amp up\" its work in the field. Senator Schatz raised predictive algorithms and asked if the FTC would commit to looking into that issue. Mr. Chopra said he would.<br/> Senator Klobuchar (D-MN) asked about a recent data breach in the credit reporting industry. Mr. Simons said he expects the commission to be \"all over\" any major issue involving data breaches.Student Loans. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) asked about student loan scams and what the FTC can be doing at the federal level. Mr. Chopra said the situation resembles the foreclosure crisis. He said he knows the FTC has been criticized for being late on the issue, but believes the staff has done good work that they need to amplify and not allow history to repeat itself.<br/> Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) asked about student debt relief scams and how the FTC should work with the Department of Education and other agencies to address them. Mr. Chopra said there is no question the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and DOE must tackle the problem by working together, along with state attorneys general. He said the debt relief scams are the symptom, and that the authorities also need to address the underlying cause, which he believes to be subpar student loan servicing.Child Privacy. Senator Markey (D-MA) asked what the nominees will do to ensure child-directed applications are fashioned to protect privacy and asked each of the nominees to pledge to promote pro-child privacy policies. Each of the nominees agreed. Mr. Chopra said the market has evolved very quickly with technology and pledged to notify the committee if he feels the FTC lacks the authority it needs.Online Gaming. Senator Hassan (D-NH) asked about violent video games and \"loot boxes\" (a form of reward in online gaming). Each of the nominees agreed that children becoming addicted to gaming is a problem that warrants the FTC's attention and agreed to examine issues with loot boxes.Telemarketing. Senator Capito (R-WV) asked about the new age of telemarketing. Ms. Wilson said the Do Not Call initiative was initially successful but technology has now outpaced that effort. She said the FTC must evolve on the issue.<br/> Senator Tester (D-MT) asked about telemarketers. Mr. Simon said he expects there is a technological solution to the problem. Mr. Phillips said a solution must be a priority for the Commission. Mr. Chopra agreed it should be a priority but expressed concern that the agency does not have the resources and tools to solve it.FTC Telecommunication Authority. Senator Blumenthal (D-CT) asked about the Ninth Circuit's recent panel decision FTC v. AT&amp;T Mobility, which overturned an FTC enforcement action against AT&amp;T Mobility for allegedly \"throttling\" data usage for certain customers. He said the decision creates a major gap in the FTC's jurisdiction. Mr. Simons said he expects the en banc Ninth Circuit will reverse the panel decision. He said he would support eliminating the common carrier exception from the FTC Act entirely. Senator Blumenthal expressed concerns about \"mobile cramming\" (including third-party charges in bills for telecommunication services).Other Topics. Senator Wicker (R-MS) asked the nominees specifically about proposals to change the FTC's \"contact lens rule,\" expressing skepticism about whether a rule that is currently working well should be changed. Mr. Simons said he believes that if it \"ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Ms. Wilson agreed. Mr. Chopra said the agency should be careful about imposing unnecessary burdens on the smallest industries.<br/> Senator Baldwin (D-WI) asked about travel-rating websites and the potential that they may be incentivized to promote positive reviews to collect click-based compensation. Each of the nominees agreed to look into that issue.<br/> Senator Capito (R-WV) asked about the role the FTC plays in addiction issues. Mr. Chopra said addiction can create conditions where consumers are susceptible to serious scams and fraud, including body brokering in the opioid epidemic.<br/> Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) asked about deceptive and unfair marketing practices surrounding the use of fake bots and social media followers. Mr. Chopra said sales and marketing are often more effective with more trust, and said he looks forward to addressing that trust problem. Senator Moran asked about ticket bots, saying someone needed to be made an example of. Ms. Wilson agreed to vigorously enforce the BOTS Act and make sure violators are held up as examples.</p><p>Other</p><p> Federal vs. State Enforcement. Senator Cortez-Masto (D-NV) asked how the nominees expect to interact with state attorneys general. Each of the nominees said they plan to work very closely with state attorneys general to use them as a \"force multiplier.\" Senator Cortez-Masto asked Mr. Simons how he will incorporate other commissioners into everyday decision making. He said he foresees it being \"Team FTC,\" and each nominee has significant expertise that he intends to make use of.Influence of Former Chairman Muris. Senator Cruz (R-TX) asked Mr. Simons and Ms. Wilson what lessons they learned from working with former FTC Chairman Muris. Mr. Simons said he learned to set clear priorities and communicate them well. He said he values high staff morale and intends to follow former Chairman Muris in promoting morale. Ms. Wilson said she learned the value of having a positive agenda to implement rather than just reacting.Appropriations. Senator Moran (R-KS) asked about the Commission's appropriations and if Mr. Simons had anything on which he would like the Appropriations Committee to focus. Mr. Simon said he didn't know enough yet to say whether they might need more or less money in certain areas, but his bias at this point would be to \"keep the ship steady.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Senator Capito closed the hearing on behalf of Chairman Thune. She said that given the committee's intention to get the nominations on the next committee markup, the record would remain open until Tuesday, February 20, and responses would be due by Monday, February 26.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

In the past few weeks alone, competition law and big tech have been in the spotlight in both a call to reopen a Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\" or \"Commission\") investigation into Google and a forthcoming meeting among Attorney General Jeff Sessions, state Attorneys General investigating social media companies and a representative from the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division (\"DOJ\").</p><p>The FTC jumped into the fray on September 13, 2018 when it kicked off its hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, which had been announced earlier this year. The purpose of the hearings is to utilize the agency's Section 6 authority \"to consider whether broad-based changes in the economy, evolving business practices, new technologies, or international developments might require adjustments to competition and consumer protection law, enforcement priorities, and policy.\" Among the announced topics are issues that have dominated the news lately, including: competition in technology markets, particularly those featuring two-sided \"platform\" businesses (ones that cannot make a sale to one side of the market without simultaneously making a sale to the other); the intersection of privacy, data and competition; evaluating the competitive effects of vertical mergers (those that join firms at different levels of the supply chain, e.g., the AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal challenged unsuccessfully by DOJ); and the consumer welfare standard, which has served as the economic principle guiding antitrust enforcement since the 1980s. The FTC has accepted more than 500 public comments on 20 announced topics and continues to invite public comment in advance of specific hearing sessions.</p><p>Commission Chairman Joe Simons set the stage for the opening session by highlighting the combination of increased economic concentration and decreased antitrust enforcement that has generated calls to reassess the very nature of antitrust policy, noting that he is approaching the discussions \"with a very open mind.\"</p><p>The panel discussions that followed the opening session focused on the current landscape of competition and consumer protection law and policy, concentration and competitiveness in the U.S. economy, and the regulation of consumer data. Key takeaways so far include:</p><p> The Commission is eager to set competition enforcement priorities. Tech companies appear to be in the crosshairs.Although there is growing concern about increased concentration in the economy, there is no consensus that big equates to bad. While some panelists cited data linking concentration to income inequality and reduced innovation, others cautioned that protecting less efficient businesses in the name of competition is misguided.Effective privacy and data breach enforcement likely require new, modern tools both for detection and regulation. The FTC's consumer protection mission likely will need to account for changes in federal legislation and/or voluntary rules established by the tech industry.</p><p>Videos of past hearing sessions are available online, along with public comments and additional information.</p><p>The FTC's end goal is to produce one or more policy papers, patterned after the fruits of the 1995 hearings hosted by then-FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky. Those hearings, which focused on global competition and innovation, led to two staff reports on competition and consumer protection policy \"in the new high-tech, global marketplace\" and helped pave the way for U.S. agency actions blocking mergers primarily based on harms to innovation. The Commission once again is revisiting its approach.</p><p>In the interim, stay tuned for additional updates as the hearings continue.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The tremendous growth was due in large part to a ninefold increase in the value of deals in China, to US$25.5 billion  nearly as much as the US$26.7 billion from all fintech investments globally in 2017. China accounted for 46 percent of all fintech investments in 2018. More than half of Chinas fintech investment came from the record US$14 billion funding round in May of Ant Financial, which manages the worlds largest money market fund but is perhaps best known for its Alipay mobile payments service. The single Ant Financial fundraising, which Accenture categorized under wealth and asset management, makes up the vast majority of all funding for that category, catapulting investment into wealth and asset management startups to lead position, with 30 percent of total investments globally. Payment startups accounted for 23 percent of the fintech financing, and those in lending accounted for 19 percent.</p><p>Even with the current volatility in global markets and ongoing macroeconomic concerns, investment in the fintech sector remains strong, said Richard Lumb, group chief executive  Financial Services at Accenture. The demand for fintech innovations by banks and other financial services companies continues to grow as they face regulatory and capital pressure; competition spurred by Open Banking from new entrants, including Big Tech and neo-banks; and new and evolving security threats. After Ant Financial, the next-largest fundraiser was Chinas Du Xiaoman Financial  spun off from Chinese search engine giant Baidu in April  which raised US$4.3 billion in two separate transactions to bolster its consumer finance business and strengthen cooperation with domestic lenders. Another large transaction in China included the US$1.3 billion that wealth management platform Lufax raised in December after postponing plans for a Hong Kong IPO. The value of deals in the U.S. also rose sharply, up 46 percent to US$16.6 billion. Despite historically being the biggest and busiest market for fintech financing, the U.S. had no deal larger than US$1 billion in 2018, with the top deal being the US$600 million that online lender LendingPoint raised from a credit transaction in May. Fintechs in payments accounted for 24 percent of U.S. funding, those in lending raked in 22 percent, and insurtechs accounted for 19 percent.</p><p>In the U.K., fintech investment jumped more than 50 percent, to US$3.9 billion. Challenger banks were among the biggest beneficiaries of U.K. fintech financing, underscoring investors outlook for the sector just as the launch of Open Banking regulations in the country made it easier for consumers to share their financial data with third-party providers. Atom Bank received nearly US$200 million in March, Revolut raised US$250 million in April, and Monzo raised about US$110 million in October. In addition, Prodigy Finance, which provides cross-border loans to postgraduate students, raised US$1 billion from a group of banks and other investors. Lumb continued: There was much talk about how uncertainty due to Brexit would grip the success of fintech from the UK. However, our analysis shows that London, a pioneer in Open Banking, remains the fintech capital of Europe, capturing 56 percent of total European investments in 2018. Its vital that London continues to foster an environment that encourages competition in the banking industry, irrespective of uncertainty, and that banks continue to modernize their services for the digital age.</p><p>There were broad gains elsewhere around the world as well, with record fundraising in Canada, Australia, Japan and Brazil. Specifically, investments in Japan jumped more than fivefold, to US$542 million; fundraising in Australia more than doubled, to US$757 million; investments in Canada rose 53 percent, to US$961 million; and in Brazil investments grew 38 percent, to US$587 million. The number of fintech deals also grew significantly, to 3,251 globally  up approximately 19 percent from 2017  as venture capital investors, private equity firms, traditional banks and insurers combed the world for the newest technologies in payments, banking and wealth management. In China, the number of deals more than doubled, to 348 (from 154 in 2017), underscoring an active fintech ecosystem in the country that still has a lot of room to grow compared with the U.S., where more than 1,100 deals took place. Activity also rose sharply in the U.K., with 24 percent more deals; in Singapore, with 16 percent more deals; and in Japan, where the number of deals nearly tripled.</p><p>Even if you discount the massive Ant Financial transaction, wed still have a record year for global fintech fundraising, with strong activity in many corners of the world, so these are broad-based gains, said Piyush Singh, a managing director at Accenture who leads its Financial Services practice in Asia-Pacific and Africa. Its hard to tell whether well be able to keep up with this pace of torrid growth, but one thing is for sure: Many investors have woken up to the fact financial technology can add a lot of benefits to businesses and consumers alike both in developed and developing markets, which is why we keep seeing an increase in fintech activity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-139464475</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VK2-6251-F11P-X4BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

The convergence of biopharmaceuticals, drug delivery devices, and companion diagnostics enabled by digital connectivity is driving regulatory and commercial changes in many exciting ways for the industry.</p><p>\"The scope for synergies among disciplines is attracting big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple (GAFA) to the life sciences industry, said Unmesh Lal, Program Manager, Transformational Health. \"The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based solutions for drug discovery and clinical trial workflow is improving the overall efficiency of production. Additionally, pathology and research laboratories are increasingly adopting health analytics solutions to track the test utilization and efficiently tackle reimbursement issues.\"</p><p>In 2018, innovations and new business models spun around data monetization as a result of value-based medicine; a connected ecosystem will be the most talked about areas. Incorporation of advanced technologies will drive the delivery of precision healthcare, raising the following growth opportunities:</p><p>AI and cloud deployment in pharma research and development (R&amp;D): Drug discovery and clinical development IT solutions spending to exceed $10 billion in 2018;</p><p>Convergence of molecular diagnostics and big data analytics: Disruptive startups with oncology diagnostics portfolio will see high rewards from their investments;</p><p>Smart genomics: Research labs jump-start spending on cloud, NGS and big data analytics solutions;</p><p>Biopharma partnerships with contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMO) and contract research organizations (CRO): Outsourcing of bio-analytical and current good manufacturing practice  (cGMP) services  is expected to reach $8.5 billion in 2018;</p><p>Liquid biopsy and companion diagnostics: Roughly $500 million in venture capital funding is expected to flood the liquid biopsy space as companion diagnostic-based liquid biopsy tests gain approval from the regulatory authority; and</p><p>Biotech expansion into CAR-T and gene therapies: Favorable tax reforms and competition for new assets could lead to higher valuations and product deal amounts.</p><p>\"While the cell and gene therapy segments have shown potential, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies continue to invest in the promising segments of oncology, cardiovascular, diabetes, and immunology. These segments not only have high unmet needs but also have high acceptability across regions,\" noted Lal. \"Overall personalization, decentralization, collaboration, and prevention are amplifying precision health, thereby shaping the future business models and the workforce of life sciences companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-120403949</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SRF-2P11-F11P-X1K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.
