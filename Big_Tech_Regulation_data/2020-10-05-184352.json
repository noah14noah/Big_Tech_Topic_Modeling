The investment, from the new WARF Ventures project, will help PROMISS Diagnostics in Milwaukee advance a technology to diagnose ovarian cancer from blood samples.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PROMISS has licensed a WARF patent related to using machine learning to distinguish benign from malignant ovarian masses. The investment will fund retrospective clinical studies at Midwest hospitals and research institutions, and an FDA pre-submission application. \"The initial study showed that the technology works but now we need to optimize it using different hospitals data,\" says founder and CEO Jalal Sulaiman.</p><p>WARF has prospered for nine decades by licensing patents earned by UW-Madison inventors, delivering the 2019 dollar equivalent of $2.7 billion to fund the university. But \"get-patent-and-license\" is no longer the only way to earn money for WARF and its beneficiary, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says Mike Partsch, WARF's new chief venture officer.</p><p>Partsch, who has deep roots in startups nationwide, particularly in medical devices growing out of university inventions, came on board in 2018.</p><p>The goal of WARF Ventures, he says, is to help university startups climb out of the lab, cross the \"valley of death\" separating grant-funded life inside the university and independent existence as a business, and attract larger investments that will help reach profitability.</p><p>We sat down with Partsch to discuss WARF's new venture fund.</p><p>Q: What is WARF Ventures?</p><p>A: We are a $110 million venture capital fund created by WARF with its own funds. Our primary mission is to support companies -- through grant money and invested equity -- that are developing technologies rooted at UW-Madison. Most of these will come from WARF's collection of patents, or from other forms of IP (intellectual property), such as the copyrights for software.</p><p>Ultimately, the relatively large investments we make should bring along other venture capital funds. Speaking in generic terms, the startup business is built around milestones: first a patent, then a startup team, then a market analysis and a prototype, and regulatory approvals. Meeting each milestone takes money, and passing milestones typically attracts further investment.</p><p>We envision a virtuous spiral where one smart investment sparks successes, and then another, larger investment. Our role will be near the beginning of this process. We are smaller than venture funds on the coasts, but we do have connections there, and the Midwest is gaining a reputation as a source of great businesses.</p><p>Q: WARF has had a long history of success by licensing UW-Madison inventions. What changes in the entrepreneurial landscape have sparked the growing emphasis on investing in university-based startup innovations?</p><p>A: The attitude among industry partners has changed. A couple of decades ago, a pharmaceutical company might become intrigued with a new patent for a compound that seemed effective, say, against diabetes. But drug development is extremely costly, and the big tech companies have figured out that their real value-add is in sales and marketing, not early-on development of new compounds.</p><p>Industry wants more assurance that a patented process or material will succeed in the marketplace. In response, university technology transfer offices are seeking better ways to transform raw technologies into great products, which occurs more easily among startups. The projects that interest us need some extra progress in the university or a startup before they appeal to venture capitalists. We call this \"proof of concept,\" or the seed stage of company development, and that's where we can make the most difference.</p><p>That, in short, is why WARF started WARF Ventures.</p><p>Q: You came on board six months ago. WARF started 93 years ago. How is it adapting?</p><p>A: WARF, as the nation's first organization to license university inventions, has a long legacy of success and innovation. Although success can cause you to rest on laurels, we see WARF adjusting, changing, as it must.</p><p>Two other new programs acknowledge the changing landscape we just spoke about. WARF Therapeutics is advancing medicines. WARF Accelerator provides guidance and investment for promising projects that are not yet companies.</p><p>While these programs provide grant money to advance technology, WARF Ventures is dedicated to investing in an existing legal entity -- in a company. We will work together, as WARF Accelerator and WARF Therapeutics are natural feeder programs for us.</p><p>I also do weekly \"office hours\" consulting for startups and entrepreneurs at UW Hospital room K6/110 and the Discovery Building, and likely at other locations soon. Scientists and entrepreneurs can come to chat -- no charge and no obligation. I've already met some outstanding innovators with great ideas, people who said the equivalent of, \"I am starting a company and don't know the first thing about business.\" But these are very smart people, and they learn fast.</p><p>Q: Does Wisconsin have the kind of entrepreneurial leadership that is needed for fast-growing startups?</p><p>A: Maybe not enough of it. We tend to have engineers, scientists, people who know the technology, but you need both. In California, we had entrepreneurs with experience from four or five companies. Some startups had succeeded, others had failed, but the entrepreneurs learned from both cases.</p><p>I think we will get the business side. We now have very successful companies on a high growth curve, like Epic and Exact Sciences, that are attracting talented team members and also inspiring others to start amazing businesses in Wisconsin. So it's easy to anticipate that more management will move here. Success begets success, and this movement of management is parallel to the increase in investment I anticipate from outside the Midwest.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6859425 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6859425</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2Y-83D1-JC11-13CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1018\"/><timeReceived>1:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Otto Warmbier's family this morning in mourning. Lawmakers are seething. How will the White House respond?</p><p>DAVE BRIGGS, CNN ANCHOR: Senate Democrats vowing to bring business to a crawl. This over Republican secrecy on health care. Now, GOP leadership is demanding a vote by late next week.</p><p>ROMANS: And did you hear about this big special election in Georgia today? It is seen as a referendum on the first months of the <person><nameText>Trump presidency. </nameText></person>Can the Democrats nab a seat that has been reliably Republican since 1979?</p><p>BRIGGS: It's fascinating.</p><p>ROMANS: It really is. A lot of money in that race right now.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: And I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>A lot of media down there, as well. Both sides will argue over what it means. But up first, North Korea facing outrage over the death of Otto Warmbier. The American college student has died less than a week after his release by Pyongyang. His family believes he was tortured into a coma while being held in captivity for 17 months.</p><p>Warmbier's passing quickly sparking anger in Washington. Senator John McCain, a former prisoner himself, making his anger very clear. He says, quote, Let us state the facts plainly. Otto Warmbier, an American citizen, was murdered by the Kim Jong-un regime.</p><p>ROMANS: High-level talks between the U.S. and China begin tomorrow in Washington. And there's growing pressure on <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to take a harder line with Beijing to help rein in North Korea. Listen to the president's reaction to Otto Warmbier's death.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Otto Warmbier has just passed away. He spent a year in North Korea. A lot of bad things happened, but at least we got him home to be with his parents where they were so happy to see him even though he was in very tough condition. But he just passed away a little while ago. That's a brutal regime, and we'll be able to handle it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: So what does the president mean by that?</p><p>[04:35:01] By \"we'll be able to handle it\"? Let's go live to Seoul and bring in Paula Hancocks.</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Christine. Well, that's the question everyone on this side of the world is asking, as well. What exactly did <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>mean, we will be able to handle it?</p><p>Now, there are still the same options today as there were yesterday, potentially strengthening sanctions against North Korea, encouraging or putting pressure on Beijing to try and put more pressure on North Korea. Of course, China is North Korea's main trading partner, main ally, and without their support, it would be difficult for North Korea to survive. So, potentially, at that meeting, that high-level talks that we will be seeing in Washington, the White House and United States could be putting more pressure on China to try and do more.</p><p>But, of course, they're in a fairly tricky situation because you have to remember there are still three Americans being held in North Korea. There are two academics who were working at the Pyongyang University for science and technology. There is also a businessman who North Korea has accused of being a spy. He has been convicted and sentenced to hard labor.</p><p>So, it's a very tricky situation to find themselves in at this point. And, interestingly, we are seeing the tour group that Otto Warmbier was on. The Young Pioneer Tours has now decided that they will no longer accept U.S. citizens on their tours to North Korea. The U.S. State Department still saying they strongly advise against traveling to North Korea. The tour groups themselves are going to alone. Other groups saying they're reviewing the policy, as well -- clearly a difficult situation for them.</p><p>ROMANS: And I just think a new low really for the regime in Pyongyang. I mean, to have this young man for so long -- and from the family doctor, it sounds as though he had been -- had been in a coma for months and months, and then finally returning him. Just a new low for Pyongyang. You wonder what the White House will do, what new set of circumstances the White House will consider here.</p><p>Paula, thank you for keeping us up to speed on that.</p><p>BRIGGS: So, the family of Otto Warmbier releasing a statement in the hours after their son's passing which reads: It would be easy at a moment like this to focus on all that we lost -- future time that won't be spent with a warm, engaging, brilliant young man whose curiosity and enthusiasm for life knew no bounds. But we choose to focus on the time we were given to be with this remarkable person.</p><p>When Otto returned to Cincinnati late on June 13th, he was unable to speak, unable to see, and unable to react to verbal commands. He looked very uncomfortable -- almost anguished. Although we would never hear his voice again, within a day the countenance of his face changed.</p><p>He was at peace. He was at home, and we believe he could sense all that.</p><p>Funeral arrangements for Warmbier have not been announced.</p><p>ROMANS: All right.</p><p>Thirty-seven minutes past the hour.</p><p>Democrats holding the Senate floor late into the night. While you were sleeping, they were up past midnight demanding that Republicans go public with their plans for repealing and replacing Obamacare. The Democrats' speeches overnight, more theatrics than lawmaking as they tried to spotlight the secretive process Republicans are using to draft their health care bill.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling it, quote, the greatest miscarriage of legislative practice that he's seen during his decades in Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: When you do a bill in dark of night, things happen that no one knows about. There are unintended consequences that only a thorough vetting can reveal. When you do things in the dark of night, there are individual accommodations that are made that are going to look ugly when they become public.</p><p>So, the only consolation we on this side have, small consolation that it is, is the political blunder that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are making.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The Democrats coordinated effort to hold the floor last night, won't actually stall any work on the GOP health bill. Now, we're learning that Republican leaders are taking real steps toward a vote and soon.</p><p>For more, let's bring in CNN's Phil Mattingly on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Dave and Christine, if you talk to Senate Democrats they recognize this is an urgent moment in their effort to try and derail Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Why? Well, sources tell me Mitch McConnell has made very clear, the Senate majority leader, that he wants this Senate to vote on that repeal and replace plan before the July 4th recess. That means next week. I'm told a vote likely to come on Thursday if things continue to progress. And that is exactly why on Monday you saw Senate Democrats take to the floor and start to register their objections.</p><p>Now, what will those entail? Well, trying to slow down Senate business. Nothing can move forward in the Senate without every senator agreeing for just that to happen.</p><p>[04:40:00] And that's exactly what the Senate Democrats are going to try and stop from happening. That means floor business, committee hearings, all sorts of things that they want to do to try to gum up the works a little bit.</p><p>Now, guys, the most interesting element is there is still no bill. Republicans haven't come to agreement on some of the key outstanding issues from the Medicaid expansion to the scope of the cutback of the Obamacare regulations, structure of the tax credit, where they stand on abortion funding. All of those issues are expected to be worked out this week.</p><p>Now, I'm told from several Senate GOP sources that Mitch McConnell will at some point tell his colleagues, tell the members of his conference, many of whom are very different ideologically when it comes to health care, that it's time to make a deal. There's no more talking. There's no more negotiating. Everybody needs to come to an agreement.</p><p>That vote is happening, or at least that's the plan at this point. They need a bill first. We'll see when they actually get to that point and how long Senate Democrats can try and hold things up in the meantime -- Dave and Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Phil Mattingly -- thanks, Phil.</p><p>Looks like a move is imminent in the White House press room even though the press room's not been used much lately. Press Secretary Sean Spicer may move to a new role. His latest briefing came off camera with no video or audio recording allowed, and more than a week since the last on-camera briefing. White House officials believe the messaging operation needs a reset. But CNN told the mood in the West Wing has soured. BRIGGS: A source says all of the president's advisers have tried to convince him to stop tweeting about the Russia investigation to no avail. Sources say the president is frustrated. He can't execute his agendas. And seems agitated, exhausted, even disengaged at briefings. All this no doubt on the minds of anyone being considered for the press secretary job.</p><p>So, what's next for Sean Spicer?</p><p>CNN's Jim Acosta has more at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Dave and Christine, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer appears to be moving into a different role in the West Wing, leaving an opening at the podium in the briefing room. White House sources tell us Spicer may be shifted into a role that oversees both the job of press secretary and communications director. Spicer's tenure at the podium has been filled with controversial moments from the first day of the administration. Yesterday, he held an off camera, no-audio briefing that barred reporters from recording any of his comments.</p><p>Despite those restrictions, Spicer could not answer whether the president has any recordings of his conversations at the White House. Spicer said that we may have an answer to that by the end of the week. But, of course, they said that last week -- Dave and Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: I got to tell you, Jim Acosta yesterday, it was really interesting how he had to handle a tough situation, because all these press people in there were like, wait a minute, we can't run the video? We can't run the audio? What is this?</p><p>At a city council meeting this would not be cool. You know, it's the White House.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, and top of that, having a question from a Russian reporter and when Jim's not allowed to ask a question.</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>BRIGGS: Particularly would rub a White House correspondent the wrong way.</p><p>ROMANS: If you're Sean Spicer, how difficult is it to try to be the voice of the administration when the president himself could tweet ten minutes later and undermine the message? Or how do you even know what the message is?</p><p>So many times we heard from Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Sean Spicer, I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. I don't know what the president thinks about that. I haven't asked the president --</p><p>BRIGGS: Because you wonder how much communication there is between Sean Spicer, Sara Huckabee Sanders and the president, whomever takes the job will have to stipulate we actually have to communicate. Whether that's Laura Ingraham or not, that's the name you keep hearing thrown out there.</p><p>ROMANS: We'll see.</p><p>All right. Forty-three minutes past the hour.</p><p>It may be the largest leak of voter information in history. The data of almost 200 million Americans was exposed. That's more than half of the U.S. population. The source: a Republican national committee contractor. The information was accidentally made public during a security upgrade.</p><p>It was left unprotected for two days. We're talking the data of names, birthdays, voter information, even social media posts. The information is now password protected, and the RNC says it cut ties with the contractor. But this incident proves any political party can be hacked.</p><p>The president has tweeted that the RNC has stronger defense than Democrats. The Democratic National Committee was hacked during the 2016 campaign, 200 million voters. Wow.</p><p>A lot of --</p><p>BRIGGS: Time something is done about that.</p><p>So, can the Democrats steal a congressional seat that's been red for nearly four decades? It is a huge special election today in Georgia. We're there, next.</p><p>[04:48:38] ROMANS: All right. Georgia voters, good morning. You're going to the polls today in a special congressional election. The race for the open seat in Georgia's sixth congressional district seen nationally as a referendum on the <person><nameText>Trump presidency.</nameText></person></p><p>Polls show Republican Karen Handel, and the Democrat, Jon Ossoff, running neck and neck in what's becoming the most expensive House race in American history, Georgia's sixth. Up until now, the definition of reliably Republican, it has been in GOP hands since 1979, since the era of bellbottoms.</p><p>We get more from CNN's Kaylee Hartung.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLEE HARTUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On this election day in Georgia's sixth district in the northern suburbs of Atlanta, neither campaign comfortable with where they stand as this could be a race decided by just a few thousands votes come tonight. Early voting numbers give both camps reason to be optimistic, though, that's because 140,000 people cast their ballots before today. That's more than double the number of voters who voted early in April, and that includes 36,000 who didn't participate in that election.</p><p>So, no comfort here. Optimism, yes, but also reason for both camps to be tense as the vitriol in this campaign has picked up in the final days, including this attack ad.</p><p>CAMPAIGN AD ANNOUNCER: The unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans. When will it stop? It won't if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday.</p><p>[04:50:01] KARTUNG: Both candidates have denounced that ad from the Principled PAC, an organization that supports conservative leaders.</p><p>But it's not just the attacks on the airwaves that we've seen in the lead up to this election. Jon Ossoff traveling with a security detail, as he says a number of threats against him have intensified. And Karen Handel and her neighbors receiving envelops in their mailboxes last week that included a threatening letter and a white powdery substance. That substance turned out to just be baking soda. Karen Handel told me on that Thursday night, she couldn't sleep with the image of men in hazmat suits in her home.</p><p>Stakes are high tonight in Georgia's sixth.</p><p>Christine, Dave, back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIGGS: They are indeed, Kaylee.</p><p>The way U.S. elections are conducted could be in for some big changes. The Supreme Court has agreed to take up a significant gerrymandering case, redistricting, if you will, and could for the first time impose limits on how the lines are redrawn. The justices will decide whether Republicans in Wisconsin actually violated the Constitution by reconfiguring state electoral maps, back in 2011, allegedly to reduce the influence of minority voters.</p><p>The court said too much partisanship and the drawing of electoral maps is illegal. But it has never defined how much is too much. The case will be heard once the court's October session convenes.</p><p>And this is massive, holds implications across the entire country. And it is huge in terms of who owns the governorships and the House races and really shapes our politics.</p><p>ROMANS: It absolutely does. Something to watch there.</p><p>All right. Look at this -- the high-powered help desk summoned to the White House. That's quite a help desk. Technically, the White House tech stocks, moving markets all the way to record highs.</p><p>That's on \"CNN Money Stream\", next.</p><p>[04:55:58] BRIGGS: Serious questions surfacing this morning, that deadly U.S. destroyer collision. Japan's coast guard now saying it took nearly an hour before the crew of the Japanese ship involved in the collision actually reported the deadly incident. But that's not what the U.S. says.</p><p>Let's get right to CNN's Alexandra Field live at Yokosuka Naval Field.</p><p>Alex, what do we know about this discrepancy over the sequence of events here?</p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, Dave, we do know that it's going to take months, perhaps even years Japanese officials say to fully understand what went wrong, what caused the collision between the U.S. guided missile destroyer and this massive container ship in the early hours of Saturday. The navy has launched an investigation. The Japanese coast guard is also investigating.</p><p>And at the starting point, we're seeing that there already is a key discrepancy here. In the beginning, both the Navy and Japanese coast guard agreed that the crash happened around 2:20 in the morning on Saturday morning. That's when the cargo ship involved in this mayday distress called.</p><p>But now, the Japanese coast guard is saying that based on interviews with members of the crew of the container ship, they believe that the crash actually happened about 50 minutes before that. They say it isn't unusual that the crew didn't immediately call for help. They could have been following other safety procedures or trying to navigate in that busy passageway.</p><p>But the U.S. military is holding firm. They say that they believe this crash did, in fact, happen at 2:20 in the morning.</p><p>Why does this matter? Well, of course, both sides will be looking at the precise movement of both ships involved in order to determine how they could have been set on this collision course.</p><p>This was a deadly crash. The crew of the USS Fitzgerald numbered in the hundreds. Several sailors did not survive the crash. The bodies were found by divers in the sleeping compartments below deck. The bodies of the sailors are being returned to the U.S. There will be, of course, memorial services to honor the lives lost.</p><p>Already the sailors on board the USS Cole had put out their own tribute to those who lost their lives on the Fitzgerald, lining up in formation, forming the number 62 -- a tribute to the USS Fitzgerald.</p><p>And we're beginning to hear from members of the families of those servicemen killed in the crash. The family of Shingo Douglas putting a statement saying: We would like to commend the crew of USS Fitzgerald for their heroic efforts to save the ship and many lives. We know now why Shingo was proud to serve with you.</p><p>And, Dave, we have heard from officials with the Navy here that that ship was in danger of sinking.

Coombs were sometimes controversial. He was accused of \"pushing the government line\" and the opposition leader, Robert Menzies, asked if Dr Coombs was still regarded as a public servant and who was paying his salary. It didn't do him a lot of harm as he subsequently became governor of the Reserve Bank and he now is able posthumously to enjoy one of the grandest of compliments - having a Canberra suburb named after him. Let's all pray that at least within the next 100 years there can be a Pezzullo Precinct, \"gated\" of course, in a far-flung corner of the national capital and composed of government habitations reserved for personages with well-intended obsessions about \"national security\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But to get back to the point, public comments by employees in any organisation, private or public, are often contentious, especially those containing a dash of the critical.</p><p>With public service employees there's an extra twist. While all citizens in a democracy have rights to make their views known about public policy and administration, for public officials these rights need to be tempered. The problem is that the degree of tempering is often a matter of fine judgment about which there can be different legitimate views.</p><p>For the first 74 years of the Commonwealth government an attempt was made to solve this problem by applying a blanket ban on all public comments by federal officials, something that may have escaped the eagle eye of Dr Coombs. Mind you, he had had his plate full in the 1940s when the nature of Commonwealth government experienced the most radical change in its history and he was in the thick of it.</p><p>Recognising the unfairness of the blanket ban, in 1974 the then Public Service Board, with the agreement of the Whitlam government, abolished the regulation enforcing it and provided guidelines for staff. The board said that its objectives \"were to give public servants greater freedom by minimising the restrictions on comment and to encourage appropriate activities of an academic kind by staff who have special expertise\". The board's guidelines cautioned, however, that \"staff should avoid becoming involved in public controversy where this could prejudice the identity of a politically impartial career public service\". That is to say, restrictions on public comment should be the minimum necessary to maintain the public's confidence that the public service will do its very best for the government of the day whatever political party is in power. If such confidence cannot be maintained then, as happens in some other countries like the United States, swathes of public service appointments will get to be made on the basis of political affiliation rather than merit with grave consequences for public service agencies and the public interest.</p><p>While the board's 1974 guidelines have been amended over the last 45 years, including to take account of such mixed value \"innovations\" as social media, their basic message has remained the same. Coombsian controversies, however, have persisted with cases of disciplinary action against public servant commenters sometimes ending up in the courts, and even in the High Court as recently as last year.</p><p>For better or worse recent cases suggest that the Public Service Board's hopes of giving public servants \"greater freedom by minimising restrictions on comment\" may not be being realised. If so, that would be consistent with what appears to be a greater sensitivity of governments and a tendency for them to be less open and accountable. Trying to get a straight answer from most ministers and their departments hasn't got any easier.</p><p>Let's take a couple of cases.</p><p>Last month it was reported that an employee of the \"industry department\" (presumably the Commonwealth one) got into strife when he lodged an internet post saying that the virus was benefiting \"big tech\" companies, a harmless enough observation. It's reported he was told to remove the post or be sacked because what he'd said could damage government relations with \"big tech\" companies. The person removed the post but then resigned because he said he was so offended by the gratuitous attempt to muzzle him.</p><p>More startling was the recent attempt by authorities at the Australian War Memorial to ban its family history volunteers from speaking about the memorial's $500 million extension. They were sent a memo saying \"...as memorial volunteers you should not publicly comment on the extension. This includes not providing comment on the radio via talk back shows, commenting in the newspaper such as in the letters to the editor section, or commenting on a link or discussion on such social media as Facebook or Twitter. This includes not clicking 'Like' to someone else's comment.\" The memo went on to say that \"We are all public servants\" and \"we must not be seen to be, or be heard to be making negative comments in the public sphere\". The memo ended by threatening that \"you can lose your volunteer role at the memorial\" if you were not to submit to the edict.</p><p>In the face of the first flush of fuss at this ruling, the memorial stood its ground. When that made matters worse, its director, Matt Anderson, sounded the full retreat saying that volunteers were \"free to share concerns about the redevelopment so long as they didn't identify themselves as a spokesperson for the memorial\". He added that \"We're not going to tell volunteers what to say and think\". Good thinking, sir.</p><p>The volunteers are not public servants. They demonstrate their loyalty to the memorial by freely giving their time to it from the goodness of their hearts. Most importantly, no comments any volunteer might make about the institution's extensions need cause even the slightest flutter in the public's confidence about the ability of public servants loyally to serve the government of the day.</p><p>The war memorial's attempt to silence its volunteers reflects a hyper-sensitivity to criticism of its grand extensions the justification for which is, at best, tissue paper thin. Anyone doubting that need only consult the invited submission from its former director, Brendan Nelson, to the Public Works Committee inquiry on the project.</p><p>True to his political roots and holding a weak hand, Dr Nelson lards his submission with attempts to demean those opposing the extension. Overlooking that many former very senior military officials are aghast at what is being done, Dr Nelson impugns the motives and character of those opposed to what he has set in motion. They're \"largely strident critics of the memorial and me\". They're \"misleading\", \"disingenuous\", lack a \"willingness to understand\" and some are former staff affected by \"the circumstances of their leaving\" and who have a \"resentment of subsequent changes\" seen as \"relegating to a forgotten past their own contributions\".</p><p>The functions of the war memorial are set out in section five of its enabling Act. They essentially are for the institution to maintain a memorial for those who've died on active service and to collect related historical material and exhibit it. Dr Nelson tweaks these functions to say that the memorial is there so that those who've been killed on service \"can have their stories told\". As a former chief of the defence force has lamented, the war memorial is thus being turned from an institution of national commemoration into a museum. And on the Nelson principle it would be likely to need to double in size if the next hundred years are anything like the past ones even though the Australian War Memorial is now one of the biggest in the world.</p><p>It's no wonder the memorial and its former director are so sensitive about criticisms of its latest extension. In part that's because the case for it is stubbornly flimsy in terms of existing law and respectable commemorative principles.</p><p>A major lesson is that for the future, it would be better to keep former politicians away from governing roles in \"cultural institutions\". They generally don't mix well although, free of shackles of executive power, Dr Nelson may have made a fine volunteer at the war memorial.</p><p>Paddy Gourley is a former senior public servant. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pdg@home.netspeed.com.au\">pdg@home.netspeed.com.au</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc7c4qr1s14qohpxg849x</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R5-KBX1-JD34-V4JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1375\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Mark Warner, D-Virginia, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-VA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) will introduce the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight And Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act, bipartisan legislation that will require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to tell consumers and financial regulators exactly what data they are collecting from consumers, and how it is being leveraged by the platform for profit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"For years, social media companies have told consumers that their products are free to the user. But that's not true - you are paying with your data instead of your wallet,\" said Sen. Warner. \"But the overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they're giving up, who else their data is being shared with, or what it's worth to the platform. Our bipartisan bill will allow consumers to understand the true value of the data they are providing to the platforms, which will encourage competition and allow antitrust enforcers to identify potentially anticompetitive practices.\"</p><p>\"When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads,\" said Sen. Hawley. \"Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold. This bipartisan legislation gives consumers control of their data and will show them how much these 'free' services actually cost.\"</p><p>As user data increasingly represents one of the most valuable, albeit intangible, assets held by technology firms, shining light on how this data is collected, retained, monetized, and protected, is critical. The DASHBOARD Act will:</p><p>- Require commercial data operators (defined as services with over 100 million monthly active users) to disclose types of data collected as well as regularly provide their users with an assessment of the value of that data.</p><p>- Require commercial data operators to file an annual report on the aggregate value of user data they've collected, as well as contracts with third parties involving data collection.</p><p>- Require commercial data operators to allow users to delete all, or individual fields, of data collected - and disclose to users all the ways in which their data is being used. including any uses not directly related to the online service for which the data was originally collected.</p><p>- Empower the SEC to develop methodologies for calculating data value, while encouraging the agency to facilitate flexibility to enable businesses to adopt methodologies that reflect the different uses, sectors, and business models.</p><p>The DASHBOARD Act is the second tech-focused bill Hawley and Warner have partnered on. The first was Hawley's Do Not Track Act, which would be modeled after the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) \"Do Not Call\" list and allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection.</p><p>A section-by-section summary of the bill is available here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/414097487/Dashboard-Act-1-Pager\">https://www.scribd.com/document/414097487/Dashboard-Act-1-Pager</url>).

But that's not true you are paying with your data instead of your wallet,\" said Sen. Warner. \"But the overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they're giving up, who else their data is being shared with, or what it's worth to the platform. Our bipartisan bill will allow consumers to understand the true value of the data they are providing to the platforms, which will encourage competition and allow antitrust enforcers to identify potentially anticompetitive practices.\"</p><p>\"When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads,\" said Sen. Hawley. \"Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold. This bipartisan legislation gives consumers control of their data and will show them how much these 'free' services actually cost.\"</p><p>As user data increasingly represents one of the most valuable, albeit intangible, assets held by technology firms, shining light on how this data is collected, retained, monetized, and protected, is critical. The DASHBOARD Act will:</p><p>Require commercial data operators (defined as services with over 100 million monthly active users) to disclose types of data collected as well as regularly provide their users with an assessment of the value of that data.</p><p>Require commercial data operators to file an annual report on the aggregate value of user data they've collected, as well as contracts with third parties involving data collection.</p><p>Require commercial data operators to allow users to delete all, or individual fields, of data collected and disclose to users all the ways in which their data is being used. including any uses not directly related to the online service for which the data was originally collected.</p><p>Empower the SEC to develop methodologies for calculating data value, while encouraging the agency to facilitate flexibility to enable businesses to adopt methodologies that reflect the different uses, sectors, and business models.</p><p>The DASHBOARD Act is the second tech-focused bill Hawley and Warner have partnered on. The first was Hawley's Do Not Track Act, which would be modeled after the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) \"Do Not Call\" list and allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection.</p><p>A section-by-section summary of the bill is available here.

Warner has issued the following news release:</p><p>Today, U.S Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-VA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) will introduce the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight And Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act, bipartisan legislation that will require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to tell consumers and financial regulators exactly what data they are collecting from consumers, and how it is being leveraged by the platform for profit.</p><p>\u201cFor years, social media companies have told consumers that their products are free to the user. But that\u2019s not true \u2013 you are paying with your data instead of your wallet,\u201d said Sen. Warner. \u201cBut the overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they\u2019re giving up, who else their data is being shared with, or what it\u2019s worth to the platform. Our bipartisan bill will allow consumers to understand the true value of the data they are providing to the platforms, which will encourage competition and allow antitrust enforcers to identify potentially anticompetitive practices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads,\u201d said Sen. Hawley. \u201cEven worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold. This bipartisan legislation gives consumers control of their data and will show them how much these 'free' services actually cost.\u201d</p><p>As user data increasingly represents one of the most valuable, albeit intangible, assets held by technology firms, shining light on how this data is collected, retained, monetized, and protected, is critical. The DASHBOARD Act will:</p><p>Require commercial data operators (defined as services with over 100 million monthly active users) to disclose types of data collected as well as regularly provide their users with an assessment of the value of that data.</p><p>Require commercial data operators to file an annual report on the aggregate value of user data they\u2019ve collected, as well as contracts with third parties involving data collection.</p><p>Require commercial data operators to allow users to delete all, or individual fields, of data collected \u2013 and disclose to users all the ways in which their data is being used. including any uses not directly related to the online service for which the data was originally collected.</p><p>Empower the SEC to develop methodologies for calculating data value, while encouraging the agency to facilitate flexibility to enable businesses to adopt methodologies that reflect the different uses, sectors, and business models.</p><p>The DASHBOARD Act is the second tech-focused bill Hawley and Warner have partnered on. The first was Hawley\u2019s Do Not Track Act, which would be modeled after the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) \u201cDo Not Call\u201d list and allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2119239I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF6-K571-JDG9-Y126-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 25, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">Banking: Westpac has warned that global tech companies are emerging as some of the most significant disrupters of the financial system, and that the level of competition should be judged by the significant number of providers and range of products available to customers.</p><p>In a submission to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into competition in financial services, the 200-year old bank stresses that a competitive market supports customer choice in products and services, not just price.</p><p>\"The inquiry needs to balance the stability and strength of the Australia's financial system (including existing consumer protections) with business models and product offerings that may be based on weaker standards and less robust safeguards, to minimise the risk of system instability and financial harm to consumers,\" the submission says.</p><p>Westpac's argument runs counter to the smaller banks, credit unions and building societies, which are pushing for legislation to force the prudential regulator to consider the impact on competition of its market interventions.</p><p>As a major incumbent bank, Westpac also focuses on new market entrants and disrupters, ranging from fintech start-ups to \"big tech\" - companies such as Google, Apple and Samsung.</p><p>The bank says some of these companies have established relationships with existing, and regulated, providers of financial services, but new forms of digital payments might not need to interface with regulated payment providers at all.</p><p>Indeed, they could evolve faster than any attempt to regulate them. \"In particular, the global tech giants already have existing financial relationships with millions of customers in Australia and hundreds of millions of customers worldwide, giving them unparalleled brand recognition, loyalty, financial resources and access to data,\" the submission says.</p><p>\"Westpac believes that younger customers are particularly likely to be receptive to acquiring financial services from a technology company rather than a bank.\" The bank notes a recent survey of 18 to 30-year-old professionals by KPMG that found more than 80 per cent would consider banking with a tech giant if the offer was right.Australian banks will continue to face an ever-increasing range of , non-bank competitors, according to Westpac.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

nitf:lede=\"true\">Banking: Westpac has warned that global tech companies are emerging as some of the most significant disrupters of the financial system, and that the level of competition should be judged by the significant number of providers and range of products available to customers.</p><p>In a submission to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into competition in financial services, the 200-year old bank stresses that a competitive market supports customer choice in products and services, not just price.</p><p>\"The inquiry needs to balance the stability and strength of the Australia's financial system (including existing consumer protections) with business models and product offerings that may be based on weaker standards and less robust safeguards, to minimise the risk of system instability and financial harm to consumers,\" the submission says.</p><p>Westpac's argument runs counter to the smaller banks, credit unions and building societies, which are pushing for legislation to force the prudential regulator to consider the impact on competition of its market interventions.</p><p>As a major incumbent bank, Westpac also focuses on new market entrants and disrupters, ranging from fintech start-ups to \"big tech\" - companies such as Google, Apple and Samsung.</p><p>The bank says some of these companies have established relationships with existing, and regulated, providers of financial services, but new forms of digital payments might not need to interface with regulated payment providers at all.</p><p>Indeed, they could evolve faster than any attempt to regulate them. \"In particular, the global tech giants already have existing financial relationships with millions of customers in Australia and hundreds of millions of customers worldwide, giving them unparalleled brand recognition, loyalty, financial resources and access to data,\" the submission says.</p><p>\"Westpac believes that younger customers are particularly likely to be receptive to acquiring financial services from a technology company rather than a bank.\" The bank notes a recent survey of 18 to 30-year-old professionals by KPMG that found more than 80 per cent would consider banking with a tech giant if the offer was right.Australian banks will continue to face an ever-increasing range of , non-bank competitors, according to Westpac.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

PHOTO: Elizabeth Frantz/New York Times</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is bidding to be the policy pacesetter in the Democratic presidential primary, announced another expansive idea Friday: a regulatory plan aimed at breaking up some of America's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook. The proposal calls for the appointment of regulators who would \"unwind tech mergers that illegally undermine competition,\" as well as legislation that would prohibit platforms from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace. Warren's plan also would force the rollback of some acquisitions by technological giants, the campaign said, including Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's addition of Whole Foods, and Google's purchase of Waze. </p><p>Companies would be barred from transferring or sharing users' data with third parties. Dual entities, such as Amazon Marketplace and AmazonBasics, would be split apart. \"I want a government that makes sure everybody - even the biggest and most powerful companies in America - plays by the rules,\" Warren said. \"To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\" During a brief interview later in New York, Warren refused to say whether Gov. Andrew Cuomo was right to have offered hefty tax incentives to Amazon in return for the proposed campus in Queens. Boston Mayor Martin Walsh, from Warren's home state, also offered similar incentives. \"That's not the point,\" she said. \"Before you even get into the question of do you need to change the statutes, there are structural changes you can make in the economy to prevent Amazon from dancing its way across America saying, 'What will you offer me if I came?'\" The announcement reverberated Friday from New York to Silicon Valley. Pressure for elected officials to place additional oversight on mega-tech companies has been building for months, particularly after revelations that companies such as Facebook may have violated customer privacy agreements. Warren is also sending a political warning shot across the Democratic primary field, where decisions on how much to embrace or reject Silicon Valley and its wealthy donors could become an important dividing line among candidates. In the wide-open nomination race, Democrats such as Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have expressed a willingness to limit the influence of companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - though Sanders and Klobuchar have yet to present clear policy details. Sen. Kamala Harris, who represents many of those companies based in her home state of California, has repeatedly pressed executives on consumer privacy but has stayed away from direct calls to limit their influence. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has been more willing to embrace the controversial corporations, who have frequently used their vast resources to lobby politicians of both parties. \"Our technology industry is the envy the world, and we need policies that will foster innovation and consumer choice - but we also need stronger enforcement of antitrust law,\" said Ro Khanna, the California House Democrat who represents Silicon Valley headquarters of companies such as Apple and eBay. He said blanket statements against big tech companies weren't helpful, but that each company needs to be \"evaluated on a case-by-case basis and afforded due process.\" Warren's plan creates two tiers of companies that would fall under the new regulations: those that have an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more, and those with annual revenue of $90 million to $25 billion. The upper tier would be required to \"structurally separate\" their products from their marketplace. Smaller companies would be subject to regulations but would not be forced to separate themselves from the online marketplace. Warren, who has previously said moving to Boston would have been a \"good opportunity\" for Amazon, said in a Medium post Friday morning that companies have grown so powerful that they can bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business, and can act - in the words of Mark Zuckerberg - \"more like a government than a traditional company.\" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute in Washington and a former senior adviser to the Senate Budget Committee, said Warren's plan was \"practical\" and \"necessary.\" He compared big tech companies to the tobacco monopolies of America's past, which were eventually subjected to antitrust lawsuits. \"There's been a traditional sense around the politics of D.C. that these companies are progressive,\" Stoller said. \"Their employees give to Democrats, they're friendly to social liberalism, there's an idealism to how they talk about the world. That's been the traditional sense. \"But these companies have the moral frame of Big Tobacco,\" he added. \"They don't care.\" Carl Szabo, who is vice president at an e-commerce trade association called NetChoice, said he felt Warren's plan was unnecessary. He warned that it could lead to weaponization of antitrust laws, as legislators target companies deemed to be their enemies. \"Politicizing and weaponizing antitrust law is ripe for abuse,\" said Szabo, a professor of privacy law at George Mason University's law school. \"We've already seen how politics can inject itself into antitrust reviews, and I don't think our legislators should be encouraging this precedent.\" He added that he also felt Warren is \"wrong in her assertion that tech markets lack competition.\" \"Never before have consumers and workers had more access to goods, services and opportunities online,\" Szabo said. In the announcement, Warren's team included praise from several scholars on internet privacy and technology regulation, including Siva Vaidhyanathan from the University of Virginia and Frank Pasquale of the University of Maryland's School of Law.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN65153625</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-MT11-DYRV-405K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

But she did not weigh in on whether the president\u2019s favorite platform should suspend him. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead, she turned the discussion back toward antitrust and campaign finance laws, repeating that she had vowed not to take money from many corporate interests.</p><p>Here is a transcript of the exchange:</p><p>HARRIS: Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account, that you did not agree. And I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice. And he and his account should be taken down. We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.</p><p>WARREN: So, look, I don\u2019t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That\u2019s our job.</p><p>HARRIS: Join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.</p><p>WARREN: No. Let\u2019s figure out \u2014</p><p>HARRIS: No?</p><p>WARREN: Why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century, and yet for decades now, we\u2019ve all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, big ag, how the gun industry, big tech \u2014 you know, we really need to address the elephant in the room, and that is how campaigns are financed.</p><p>HARRIS: You can\u2019t say you\u2019re for corporate responsibility if it doesn\u2019t apply to everyone.</p><p>WARREN: I announced this morning that I\u2019m not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We\u2019ve already agreed, Bernie and I, we\u2019re not taking any money from big pharma executives. You can\u2019t go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices that support us all.</p><p>HARRIS: It does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>HARRIS: Holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people\u2019s perceptions about issues. And they actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power. It is immense.</p><p>MARC LACEY, moderator: Senator Klobuchar, let me bring you in here. Your response.</p><p>HARRIS: I\u2019m not finished. I\u2019m not finished. And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.</p><p>WARREN: Look, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don\u2019t have a problem with that.</p><p>HARRIS: So you will join me in saying Twitter should shut down that account?</p><p>WARREN: What I have a problem with is, if we\u2019re going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we\u2019re going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.</p><p>Jake Frankenfield contributed reporting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000006771077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8T-YJF1-DXY4-X43T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><timeReceived>00:01 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Harris, Kamala D</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Warren, Elizabeth</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Harris, Kamala D</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Warren, Elizabeth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidential Election of 2020</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001344</classCode><className>POLITICAL DEBATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TA3</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XKJ</classCode><className>BUSINESS ETHICS &amp;

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is drafting a bill that would call on regulators to retroactively review about two decades of \"mega mergers\" and ban such deals going forward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren's staff recently circulated a proposal for sweeping anti-monopoly legislation, which would deliver on a presidential campaign promise to check the power of Big Tech and other industries. Although the Trump administration is currently exploring their own antitrust probes, the proposal is likely to face resistance from lawmakers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to a draft of the bill reviewed by Bloomberg, the proposal would expand antitrust law beyond the so-called consumer welfare standard, an approach that has driven antitrust policy since the 1970s. Under the current framework, the federal government evaluates mergers primarily based on potential harm to consumers through higher prices or decreased quality. The new bill would direct the government to also consider the impact on entrepreneurs, innovation, privacy and workers.</p><p>Warren's bill, tentatively titled the Anti-Monopoly and Competition Restoration Act, would also ban non-compete and no-poaching agreements for workers and protect the rights of gig economy workers, such as drivers for Uber Technologies Inc., to organize.</p><p>A draft of Warren's bill was included in an email Monday from Spencer Waller, the director of the Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies at Loyola University Chicago. Waller urged fellow academics to sign a petition supporting it. He said Warren was working on the bill with Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the most prominent voice on antitrust issues in the House. Waller declined to comment on the email.</p><p>In Washington, there is some support across the political spectrum for increased antitrust scrutiny of large technology companies. Warren positioned herself as a leader on the issue this year while campaigning on a plan to break up Big Tech. She has repeatedly called for unwinding Facebook Inc.'s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, along with Google's purchase of YouTube and advertising platform DoubleClick.</p><p>It's not clear when a bill would be introduced or whether it would move forward in its current form. Cicilline has said he would not introduce antitrust legislation until he concludes an antitrust investigation for the House Judiciary Committee in early 2020.</p><p>Amy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota who's also vying for the Democratic nomination, has pushed legislation covering similar ground. Klobuchar plans to introduce additional antitrust legislation soon, according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn't authorized to discuss the plans and asked not to be identified.</p><p>Any proposal would face significant hurdles to becoming law, and Warren's version could be particularly problematic because it promotes the idea that antitrust enforcement is equivalent to being against big business, said Barak Orbach, a law professor at the University of Arizona who received a draft of the bill. \"The way I read it is that Elizabeth Warren is trying to make a political statement in the course of her campaign,\" Orbach said. \"It's likely to have negative effects on antitrust enforcement, so I just don't see the upside other than for the campaign.\"</p><p>The bill proposes a ban on mergers in which one company has annual revenue of more $40 billion, or both companies have sales exceeding $15 billion, except under certain exceptions, such as when a company is in immediate danger of insolvency. That would seemingly put a freeze on many acquisitions for Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Facebook, Microsoft Corp. and dozens of other companies. The bill would also place new limitations on smaller mergers.</p><p>Chris Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University, said the proposal would serve as an effective check on corporate power. \"I don't think you'll have new antitrust policy until Congress says the courts have incorrectly interpreted the statutes,\" he said. \"Someone has to do what Elizabeth Warren is doing.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: THE DRAFT BILL would extend anti-monopoly law, potentially checking the power of Big Tech.

And as we look at how it's trading, it is up slightly, about .5 percent.  </p><p>      What do you think of that trade?  </p><p>      Do you think it would have been higher, lower?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, that doesn't change my conclusion, because of some half a percent.  And, you know, I don't -- I have no idea whether Berkshire's stock will go up or down in the next week or month or year.  </p><p>      But in relation to the businesses we own, it -- it's attractive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  One of the number one questions that came out this weekend -- it was interesting to me, because I've been coming six years and I have never heard so many people ask why isn't Berkshire paying a dividend.  This at a time when the largest percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies are now paying dividends.  It's the first time in a long time that they are.  </p><p>      And then you have the fact that you own dividend paying stocks like Coca-Cola, American Express, Intel, which just raised its dividend this morning, by the way.  </p><p>      Why won't you pay a dividend to your shareholders? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, we think our shareholders, five years from now, will be wealthier, counting what they would get from the reinvestment of the dividend.  We think they would be -- they'll be wealthier if we hold onto the money.  </p><p>      Now, we may be wrong in that, but historically we've been right. And if -- if we had paid a dividend over the years our shareholders would be considerably poorer than they -- 10 years ago.  And as long as we -- I think we will have the opportunity to invest dollars, to create more than a dollar of present value, we'll retain the money. And when we don't think we can do that we'll either repurchase stock or pay dividends.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Is there no way you will ever pay a dividend?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Oh, some day Berkshire will pay a dividend because it will get so large that it can't use the money, or all of the money that it earns, effectively.  </p><p>      But -- but we don't think we're at that point, although we're much closer to that point, obviously, than we were 20 years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  I just mentioned that Coke pays a dividend.  Speaking of Coke, the board is mulling a stock split.  </p><p>      Would you be for a stock split of Coca-Cola?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I'm -- I'm totally neutral on that.  It's -- it's fine with me if they do and it's fine with me if they don't.  </p><p>      But it -- it won't make any difference to us in terms of the value of our Coca-Cola stock.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  OK.  The succession plan was a very major focus here. And you said you'd be very clear about it.  You do finally have one person in mind, with two back-ups.  I got you to tell us yesterday that it was a he.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  But it is a male?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  It's a male.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  It is a male.  OK.  I talked to some shareholders who said it is becoming increasingly evident to them that it's Ajit Jain, who runs your insurance business.  Keep going with the poker-faced one, because they say the insurance business is increasingly becoming the -- one of the major important factors, the most important factors for the future of Berkshire and the profits that it brings in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Look, I would say this about the insurance business. It's been enormously important in getting us to where we are now. It's still enormously important.  It's actually not as important relative to the entirety of Berkshire as it was 10 years ago.  We've added more businesses away from insurance. </p><p>      But insurance has driven us to where we are presently.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  And the culture, you said he understands the culture of Berkshire.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Oh, all three of the candidates understand the culture very well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  All right.  All three, but Ajit at the top?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Oh, I --  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  When -- when we put you on the board, you'll know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  OK.  All right.  Only the board knows.  </p><p>      You also said about your successor that under your new successor, there will not be much of a derivatives book under Berkshire's umbrella.  </p><p>      Is that because you feel you really understand derivatives in a way that nobody else does or that they've become dangerous for Berkshire?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Oh, it -- it -- there isn't that much of a derivatives book right now, if you look at the total value of Berkshire.  We've done very little in new revenues.  But we have a few and one particularly good sized position in terms of our equity put situation. Only that's nothing compared to what we have in equities overall.  </p><p>      So it's not a big deal now.  I would guess it would be a lesser deal.  And -- and partly that's because the rule -- in fact, in a big way that's because the rules have been charged on derivatives.  We would not have the derivatives position we have now if the rules had been the same five or 10 years ago in relation to posting of collateral.  We think that -- that derivatives become much more dangerous for the individual enterprise when they're required to post collateral.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  OK.  You're 81 years old.  That's not any news to anybody.  But the fact that you were diagnosed with Stage 1 prostate cancer gave some people a start.  It is obviously non-aggressive.  And you say it's a non-issue.  And you won't miss a single day of work due to your treatment, which starts in, what, July?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Mid-July.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Mid-July?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes.  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You won't miss any work at all?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No.  No.  No.  Maybe -- maybe 15 minutes a day, something like that.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  We can lose you for 15 minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, I wish -- I wish that we couldn't, but the truth is you can't.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  But when you look at the -- the person who will eventually take over, have you begun to apprentice your successor?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  My -- my successor doesn't need apprenticing.  If they needed apprenticing, they wouldn't be the successor (INAUDIBLE) --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  They wouldn't be the one?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No.  In fact, none of the three candidates would need apprenticing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  In some of what you talked about, you talked about how great some businesses are, but you talked about a big mistake.  Energy future --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  -- from a Texas utility company.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  All mine do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  So sorry to bring it up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I did it by myself.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  But these were tied very tightly to the price of natural gas.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Which plummeted shortly after you bought it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  How'd you get that so wrong?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  It was easy.  I'll probably be able to do it again.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  The -- it was -- it was -- it was just a case of not -- not cranking that into my decision, weighting it with the appropriate probability.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  But 2010, you had to do a $2 billion write up -- write- down; 2011, another $398 million write-down. </p><p>      How much --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE) that total.  But the total -- the total we put in was about $2 billion and -- and I think it's been written out of maybe $400 million or $500 million.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Well, how much was it going to get?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, it can go all the way to zero.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Do you think it will?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  It -- it easily could.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Who -- who sold you on this idea, gold (INAUDIBLE) --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Me.  Me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Really?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No, no, no.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Goldman Sachs?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No, I -- I have -- I have a real ability to pick these -- pick these out.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      One of the things you said that people sat on the edge of their seat, because they want to know what you're buying, more newspapers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  It's possible.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Jimmy Kimmel told a joke at the Washington correspondents dinner.  He said, what's black, white and red all over?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes, so I heard.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Nothing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Yet you're buying now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  And you said specifically local newspapers.  </p><p>      How about \"The New York Times?\"  </p><p>      Is that local enough? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, I -- if a -- I would have to say, if I could buy \"The New York Times,\" I might buy it personally.  I -- I don't know whether I'd buy it for Berkshire.  But it's not for sale.  </p><p>      It's -- that's a very special case.  </p><p>      The newspapers that exist in communities where there's a strong sense of community and where the newspapers respond to that strong sense of community by -- by telling people a whole lot of things that they want to know about their own community that they can't find some place else, those newspapers will do OK.  They'll still be in decline over time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  But is it that you see that their value is relatively -- that their price is relatively cheap to earnings?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  In some cases.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  In some cases.  But the earnings are not going to -- the earnings are not going to go up.  I mean you're looking -- and -- and they're probably going to go down in most -- in practically all cases.  </p><p>      So you have to buy them at a value, actually, that takes that into account.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  \"The Washington Post,\" you stepped down from the board.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  But you still fully own your position?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  We own every share we've ever owned.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Even though it's off its 52 week highs.  </p><p>      Do you feel it's doing pretty well?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, it -- I don't know whether they've published their first quarter earnings yet or not.  But -- but they have problems in two of their businesses, one in the education business and one in the newspaper.  And -- and that's been reflected, I think, in the price.  </p><p>      But those two businesses are -- well, the newspaper is far tougher than it was five or 10 years ago.  And the education business is tougher than it was about two years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  What's interesting to people, though, when you say that you would buy more newspapers is at a time when everybody else is getting out, it seems like you and Rupert Murdoch are the only people getting into newspapers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes, right.  And he may not be quite as competitive for a while, either.  So, no.  But they are not a -- it's not an industry whose earnings are going to -- the earnings are going to just shrink in the newspaper business, as are the revenues.  But not -- I don't necessarily think they'll shrink at a dramatic rate where you have a strong feeling of community and you have a newspaper that serves that community well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  \"The Washington Post\" reported Friday and their revenue --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Did they?  </p><p>      OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  -- fell.  </p><p>      Yes, their revenue fell.  Well, speaking of Rupert Murdoch, because I brought it up, hoc, is the head of News Corp, the parent of Fox Business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You -- you made a little quip about our sister network, Fox.  One shareholder questioned whether your personal politics --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  -- hurt shares of the company.  And your response was, \"I really think someone making an investment decision based on the politics of whether he agrees or not with the CEO, sounds to me like he ought to own Fox.\"  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I'll leave it at that.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  What -- what do you mean by that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, I think it's silly to make a decision --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  -- based on the politics of the CEO.  I -- I can't tell you the politics of the CEOs of our major investments.  There may be one or two that I would know about, but it is absolutely a zero factor in our making a decision on a business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  I guess maybe people were really meaning that they're in contradiction, they feel differently about the Buffett Rule than you do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You clarified in September to Fox Business News that what you meant was the uber rich should pay a commensurate tax rate of about 30 percent, that a let -- a lot of the rest of Americans are paying. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Yet the Buffet -- yet the Obama administration kind of took it in a different way and is now promoting it for people who make a million dollars or more.  </p><p>      Have you talked to the president about how he's split from what you really intended?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, that isn't really different than what I intended. I mean, I might tweak it a little bit in one direction or another. But I was talking about the people making a million or more.  </p><p>      Now I would probably have a different break, also, for the people making $10 million or more.  </p><p>      But the -- Senator Whitehouse is the one that put the bill in. And I wrote him a letter immediately after he did so that in -- I -- I basically approve of his bill.  If I were writing the bill, I'd write it a little -- slightly different, but so would everybody else.  </p><p>      But I -- I think it -- it gets at the -- it gets at the point that 131 out of 400 of the highest incomes in the country, those 400 incomes average $270 million each.  That's not bad.  That's, you know, almost three quarters of a million dollars a day.  And --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  We'd take it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes.  And a -- a third of those people paid less than a 15 percent rate, combined payroll and income tax.  </p><p>      And I -- I think -- I think that's wrong and I think it -- and in an economy where we're going to ask for shared sacrifice of people, that we ought to go after the (INAUDIBLE).  It doesn't solve the revenue problem.  </p><p>      But I think that people want a code that has at least that much fairness in it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  But, Warren, if you feel so strongly about that, why not take a bigger salary than you always have?  </p><p>      You've always opted to take your income in cash -- in -- in Berkshire stock versus cash.  </p><p>      Yet if you took a bigger salary instead, you could pay that 30 percent rate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Why not have done it that way?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, the company would get a deduction, too.  So the government would be -- would be worse off rather than wise (ph), actually, because the company would get a 35 percent deduction if they paid it to me. </p><p>      So it's -- it -- it wouldn't change the revenue, it would just take some money from the shareholders.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Here's what -- what I heard from some other people, too, is they said, you know, when you're donating most of your -- your money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is philanthropic and wonderful and yet that will keep it from being taxed.  </p><p>      And some would say, why not then let it be taxed, because it -- wouldn't it be helpful to give it as revenue to the government?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  That would be an alternative.  But I -- I think that we will probably be able to accomplish a lot more around the world with that money going to the foundation.  </p><p>      But it -- it's a wonderful tax dodge.  I urge all you -- all the viewers if they -- if they want to pay less tax, they should give away more money.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Investments -- what other countries are you investing in?  </p><p>      You mentioned an acquisition in the Netherlands.  </p><p>      But what other countries' companies are starting to look good to you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, we don't really look by country.  That -- that company in the Netherlands was for sale.  I mean the owners of it decided to sell it a month or so ago and -- and we ended up buying it last week.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  But we don't look much by country.  It -- we -- we really look for businesses we understand, with some kind of competitive advantage and good management and a price that makes sense.  </p><p>      And if we find that -- we found, you know, the most wonderful of all in Israel six or seven years ago.  And we've -- we can find them here in the United States, usually.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  And that was ISCAR?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You said that there was a $22 billion deal that you missed by that much.  You couldn't get that deal done.  You wouldn't say what sector it was in.  </p><p>      Can you say what country it was in?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No, it was -- but it was on this planet.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER) </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  I tried.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, you narrowed it down.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  How does Brazil look for investment right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, I -- I --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  See anything you like in Brazil?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  How about that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Well, I don't know that much about specific -- (INAUDIBLE).  I mean, if we found something that was interesting in Brazil, some business I understood, it was large, the price was right. The management was right, we'd buy it in a second.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You have bought some European stocks recently.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  That is true.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Which ones?  </p><p>      I mean it's going to come out in an SEC filing eventually, won't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No, actually, we don't have to report the foreign stocks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You don't have to report it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  So you won't say?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No, that's true.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  OK.  But would you say, 10, 11, 12 coun -- companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  It was about -- I think it was more like nine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Nine?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  This morning, folks, when Warren Buffet arrived here at our shoot, he quickly went upstairs to put in stock orders.  </p><p>      European stock orders?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Not today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Not today.  </p><p>      So at -- U.S. equities?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  That's what's left, yes.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Because I did say it was on this planet, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  U.S. equities look cheap then at this point, with the markets the way they are today?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Some do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Some do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Some do, sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Let's talk about the news of the weekend, as well. Nicolas Sarkozy is out in France.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  He's out.  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  And Francois Hollande, who is, of course, a Socialist, is in.  </p><p>      This is disconcerting to a lot of people who wonder, will we see capital flight away from France, the likes of what we saw when Francois Mitterand, who was also a Socialist, was elected years ago.  </p><p>      Will people take their money out of France?  </p><p>      Do you predict that or could you see that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I -- I don't know the answer to that.  I -- I would not be enthused if I had a Socialist win anyplace.  But -- but the -- I think the problems facing Europe transcend, almost, you know, those in any specific country.  I mean they have to work out the rules under which 17 countries can really work together.  When they lock themselves into a monetary unit.  And they haven't locked themselves in in a number of other ways.  </p><p>      So, I think overall what happens in Europe is probably maybe affected by the leaders in given countries, but it's going to be much more important than any specific election.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: You just said locked into a specific currency.  Was the euro idea a mistake?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>: Getting out of it would be an enormous problem, too, but I think maybe it was a mistake.  As it was done.  In fact, I can say it was a mistake as it was done.  Now the question is whether you can modify the original concept in some way that makes this more workable than it is proving to be.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Well, as it morphs and changes, Greece has parliamentary elections and neo-Nazis were elected to the parliament.  Is it just a matter of time before Greece either leaves or gets jettisoned from the euro zone?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I don't know about - I think it's a matter of time until they come up with a better solution than the present structure or they abandon it entirely. Who knows which it will happen?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Forty-seven years later from you starting your company, you finally invested in a technology stock or two.  IBM and Intel --    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Yes, I didn't - I didn't do the Intel.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: You didn't do the Intel. You did the IMB.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Who did the Intel?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>: Yes, it would have been Todd because he was the only one -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  OK.  Todd did -- Todd Holmes, who is one of your new investment managers.  It was his idea. But you never bought Microsoft. Did you hear from your board member Bill Gates about that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>: I can't buy -- I can't buy Microsoft.  If we bought Microsoft, for one thing, our buying days take place month after month after month.  And if something happened that was favorable at Microsoft, people would have said I had insider information.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Well, actually, let's bring in Bill Gates right now, who founded Microsoft -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Maybe he'll give me some insider information!  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Now's the time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: What's inside information at Microsoft (ph)?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  When you heard that he finally bought a technology stock and IBM and Intel, did you think those were pretty good ideas?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILL GATES, FOUNDER, MICROSOFT</emphasis>: Well, I think it is great that Todd gets the entire universe to exercise his great thinking.  And he has done a good job there.    </p><p>      A lot of technology companies, you can't see where they will be in 10 years or 20 years.  IBM has enough service revenue that they may be somewhat of an exception to that. But most tech stocks, you know, play a very high-variance game, which makes it I think the most interesting in the street in the world.  But not for an investor who wants any degree of downside protection.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>: He told me that when I met him in 1991, too.   </p><p>      And what point should be made about Todd. Todd can change his positions far, far easier than I can.  So, Todd is working with sums. If he decides to move onto something else, he can - he can do that.  I can't do that with the big positions that we take.  So, we are really locked in more than he would be.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Bill, you just said that with many tech stocks, you can't see where they will be in ten to 20 years.  Can you see, Warren, where Facebook would be in 10 to 20 years?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>: No, no I can't.  I mean, it is an enormously impressive accomplishment.   And my guess is it has a big future of some sort.  But I have no idea. I didn't even know what it was six or seven years ago.  And I'm still not on it, so -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Bill, are you on Facebook?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>: Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: You are on Twitter as well.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  He's in a different world.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Always have been.  In fact, I  remember when you were saying Bill had to teach you how to just simply click on the blue E for Explorer.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  He's had his problems with me.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, Warren's a big tech user (ph) if you count online bridge.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  That takes him up into the top one percent in terms of Internet addicts.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I'm like a guy who's (INAUDIBLE) to turn on the switch. And then, as far as I'm concerned, there's some guy inside that thing that's playing - (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Listen, let's talk about Facebook.  It's huge news today. The beginning of the road show.    </p><p>      Bill, you have been dealing with investors and analysts for years and banks for years and years.  Would you tell Mark Zuckerberg -- because there is question as to whether he will attend the road show. Would you say, you know, you really should get out there and do it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  I know when Microsoft had to do its road show, I minimized the amount of time.  I think I offered three days, I told them no limousines.  I took a book about biology.  I was reading during the breaks.  I tried not to have it take too much time away from the business.  You know, so, you've got to focus on what is important in making sure your profit friend (ph) users is great -- as number one  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  This is a guy that negotiated down with his mother (INAUDIBLE) down to an hour over the time he was willing to spend with me.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, I didn't know what I was in for.  I thought --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Didn't want to spend more than an hour with Buffett? Your mom said meet the guy, and --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Before Warren and I met, I wasn't sure we had that much to talk about.  Now, I was 100 percent wrong about that, but my mom made me say I would stay a few hours at this event that Kay, Graham and Warren were at.  In fact, I stayed the whole day, and I was disappointed when Warren was leaving because talking about business and the dynamics of how things were changing I found somebody I'm part of -- one of the most interesting parts of my life.  A lifelong conversation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  His mom was prying us apart at the end.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: What would you advise Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook to attend that road show?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I wouldn't worry too much.  I mean - you know, that offering was going to be big.  I'm not saying the stock is going to go, but it is going to get all the attention in the world.  And people know what Facebook is.  I mean, it's not a mystery that has to be explained.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Can it --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Except to me!  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  If -- if it does have $100 billion valuation or whatever the crazy numbers are out there, can it sustain that? What does it need to do to sustain that?  What does it need to do to sustain that, Bill?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>: Well, it just needs to have advertising revenue that makes that earnings dream properly discounted be greater than $100 billion.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER) </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  And -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Simple!  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>: It's right there in \"The Intelligent Investor\"!  </p><p>      You know, they have a lot of traffic.  And the ability to monetize that traffic over time will be fascinating to see if they can push up and go beyond the earnings stream you need for that or not. But it is one phenomenally impressive company.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Bill, everybody is always talking about the succession plan.  And you know, you went through this very  issue back when you decided to leave the CEO position at Microsoft.  The stock has done really well lately, and Windows 8 is about to blast onto the scene. And I hear from -- Recover Silicon Valley heavily at Fox Business. And I hear from them that once Windows 8 gets into the ultra-books and it becomes  a touch screen, you could very well take on the Mac Air and the MacBook.    </p><p>      Is that what Microsoft should be aiming for, and do you think it could happen with Ultra Books?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, it is very exciting that Windows 8 is coming out. It's a very big deal for the company.  Steve and the whole team are doing a great job there.  It creates a new category of machines that are sort of -- have the good things about tablets and the good things about PCs.  And so, it's going to evolve these digital tools.  </p><p>      You know, people right now like the tablet, but it's hard to -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Type on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  -- to give input.  You don't have Microsoft Office on there.  And so, with our hardware partners, there's a lot of neat stuff that comes out later year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Warren, what kind of computer do you use?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>: I think it's an HP that the guys at the furniture market (ph) sent over.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Well, what do you use, Bill?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, I have a Samsung tablet is my primary machine, but I have Dell machines and a variety.  I'm always getting the latest and greatest.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: So, no iPad for you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  No, no, -- I said I am using the latest and greatest.    </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Bill has -- they have a chimpanzee up there in Seattle, and then they have me and then they have us both test these new things.    </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      And, actually, I am more reliable than the chimpanzee.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Do you have an iPad, Warren?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  No.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: No.  So, you're not going for the tablet at this point.    </p><p>      Bill, let's just say the Samsung Galaxy has gone traction, but not nearly as much as the iPad has.  Rim couldn't come out with a tablet that smacked it down nor hp.    </p><p>      What company out there has the special something that can take on that iPad in your opinion?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, the tablets base is going to grow, but you really want something where you either have a pen or keyboard and you have your productivity applications.  So, you want the best of both worlds, and that is what Microsoft and others are pushing for.  </p><p>      I think this fall, people will understand that there is room for big improvement there.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Microsoft just made a pretty big deal, about $300 million with Barnes &amp; Noble.  Will eventually that morph into a deal to make some type of tablet or a Kindle with Microsoft abilities to jack it up?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, the idea is they are going to take their reading experience and books and make them look super good on these new devices.  And so, on these devices, you want to run Office where you create documents.  But you want to consume books in new ways, consume videos in new ways.  And so, it's that merger and having their team do innovative work is what made that investment a smart idea.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Warren, you said this weekend you would not buy Apple.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Well, I said I wouldn't know enough to buy Apple.  Yes. But no, I'm not going to buy anything I don't feel I can have a reasonable fix on what they will look like in five or ten years.  And I certainly didn't have a reasonable fix - I wish I had -- ten years ago on Apple but I don't have one now.    </p><p>      I think it's an amazing company.  But there are lots of businesses I don't understand.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Bill, tech companies have gotten so desperate to have the latest and greatest technology that they are trying to buy in in patents.  They're trying to buy chunks of patents, you know, with the Motorola mobility issue.  Today, a judge is going to consider, I believe, that Microsoft's complaint that Motorola is charging for what really should be basic technology patents.    </p><p>      Have the patent wars gotten a little out of hand?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  No, I think the idea that invention is valuable has become more obvious.  It was always true in the drug industry that the whole industry, these miracle medicine exists, because patents were protecting that invention.    </p><p>      And fortunately, we are seeing more invention in many areas.  The IT sector has got a lot, but you know, if you come up with a renewable energy design, that is going to be protected by a patent.    </p><p>      So, patents are important.  There are immensely complex, and sometimes when people look at it either because of the complexity of the system because they haven't looked into it, it seems strange to them. But the idea that invention has value - I think that  is an idea that is more and more important over time.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Warren?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Oh, I agree.  I just don't know how to invent anything.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: There have been a couple of corporate scandals.  Among them, Apple and Foxconn.  Foxconn is one of the manufacturers of components of Apple's products.  They were accused of mistreating their workers and in some cases underpaying them.  </p><p>      Did Apple handle that right?  Would you care if you found out that one of your companies under the Berkshire umbrella was buying a lot of stuff from people who mistreated their workers?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Sure, and we hope that all our companies are looking at all kinds of things including that.  But f you have a very, very large company something is going to go wrong.  And right now I can tell you with 270,000 employees at Berkshire, someone is doing something they shouldn't.   I just hope it is small, I hope we find out about it, and then I hope whoever is in charge does something about it properly but you cannot run a large army or a large government bureau or large church without things going wrong from time to time.  It's going to happen.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  It is going to happen but this Foxconn issue was out there.  Wired Magazine a year and a half ago had a huge front-page story about it, Bill.  I'm just wondering -- had that ever happened to you at Microsoft?  Would you look at that and say Apple really should have dealt with that much more quickly?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  I think American companies overall are improving labor conditions when they're involved in whether it is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or really looking down the supply chain at trying to make sure labor conditions are okay, I think American business has had a positive effect.  I don't know specifics of the Apple case but I know they are not going to try to take shortcuts in that way.  They are certainly very focused on fixing any problems at this point.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: You mentioned the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  That's pretty controversial with Wal-Mart lately and a lot of people saying hey, that is how you get business done in Mexico.  What is your response to that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  My responses is that we have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  It may very well be that's the way business is done in Mexico but you'd better not do it if you are an American corporation.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Maybe the crime was less important than the cover-up.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  It's always a problem.  I mean, I know something's being done that's wrong at Berkshire, I can't tell what it is and --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  But Warren, if somebody came to you and you knew about it, like the Wal-Mart top executives did, would you say \"don't be so aggressive on that?\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  No, but I think almost all CEOs when they know the facts - - it certainly seems quite clear there was bribery in all of that.  Exactly what happened after that, I'm not sure about, but I would think there are very few American CEOs that if they find out about some problems, they're going to try to figure out something to do and something about them promptly.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Bill, earlier we were talking with Warren about how he wants to buy more newspapers.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  He's not going to compete with me.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You are not going to buy newspapers?  Because he got the idea to buy railroads back in 2006 from you.  You were already in a Canadian railroad.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  No, Warren's has been playing with railroads since he was a boy.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  That's right.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  I can hardly take credit for introducing him to that whole sector of the economy.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  I'm repeating what he told me.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  He's very generous.  We both made good money.  We're happy railroad investors.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: You both -- and I knew this about Warren, but I didn't know you used to be a newspaper delivery boy.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  I was far better than Warren.  It's really one of those things that needs more coverage.    </p><p>      [laughter]  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I was there yesterday, he didn't show up.    </p><p>      [laughter] </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: We got video of it.  There was a newspaper throwing contest where we all tossed Omaha World Heralds to the porch of a Clayton home.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Exactly.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  I was stunned to see, here's Warren, you made it right to the porch, and then Bill exactly in the same position, that little boy is one of your grandsons.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  He won that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I own the house and the newspaper, I better be close enough.    </p><p>      [laughter]  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  When it came to ping-pong, I would say I was a little better.  We're 1 to 1 for the weekend.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  That's right.    </p><p>      [CROSSTALK]  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  2 on 1.  Then you brought up the gigantic paddle.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  That didn't work either.  [laughter]  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  In the past you've done a lot of things.  You've danced with the Nebraska cheerleaders.  You've ridden a bull.  That must have been incredible.  Back then when you were doing it, you were in your 70s.  They are both looking at the monitor.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  I look as bad as I look there as I do here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Charlie, your vice chairman, never participates in sitting on the bull or throwing the newspapers, why not?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  He's the thinker in the group.    </p><p>      [laughter]  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  In fact here he is, Charlie Munger, the vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway, joining us now.  Good morning Charlie.  Welcome to the party here.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHARLIE MUNGER, VICE CHAIR, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Charlies, there was so much focus this weekend on Warren's health and his succession plan and how much longer Warren will be running the company.  Let's turn it to you, how much longer will you be up on stage with Warren for these annual shareholder meetings?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  I serve a very important function because people look at me and think they will get another seven years out of Warren.  I don't think he's anxious to get rid of me.  </p><p>      [laughter]  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I'm there to show there's some guy older than me in American business.  Makes me look very good when I'm up there.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  How much longer will you participate?  Somebody said is this Charlie's last year?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  No.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Well, I hope not.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: You have every plan to remain on the stage at these meetings?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  I'm not going to sit up there drooling.  But I plan to be there.  If the only way to get up is to drool, then I'll drool.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You were as feisty as ever.  One comment you made got a round of applause from the audience that was on the mortgage and lending bubble.  And you said this -- this is stuff you have said over the past couple of years, but you've never phrased it like this before, you said it was wrong not to stamp down on felony and folly of all that irresponsible lending, quote I often say \"Alan Greenspan overdosed on Ayn Rand.\"  Meaning the whole free market hands-off approach was a total disaster?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Certainly.  Most of these have limits.  In other words, an ax murderer is not a good thing because it happens in a free market.  There's a limit to when the free market is -- [inaudible] a free market with that kind of fraud and folly it is not wise to allow it.  We were disgraceful to sit there and let Canada be sensible while we went crazy.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I would say this in, in fairness to Alan Greenspan and Charlie has made this point that he has said that he's sort of overestimated -- overestimated the ability of the free market to natural operations to rein in -- all the self-interest that --         </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Yes, Alan Greenspan is the only person who has apologized.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Who else should apologize?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  There's a big list, practically everybody.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Banks, U.S. banks?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Oh, my God, yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Dodd Frank, now we have that, but the last numbers I looked at, it is 850 pages long.  The Volcker Rule alone breaks down to 380 plus questions and those have more than 1400 sub-questions. Will that be the thing that prevents us from dealing with this type of disaster again?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Well, it was certainly a step in the right direction. If I had the power, I would have made the Volcker act look like a non- restraint.  I would have done much more.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  So you think that preventing banks from investing in the proprietary trading issue?  They are all complaining, Charlie, that that's ruining their ability to do well and do well for shareholders.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Well, that's natural when people were making a lot of money out of something to not want to be forced out of it.  These banks ought to only be open on Christmas.  They ought to have a fairly restricted repertoire.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Well, we the taxpayers bailed out a lot of them, including AIG.  In the news today is the Treasury Department will try and sell off more taxpayer holdings of AIG.  Do you think the bailout of AIG was something we had to do?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Probably.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Do you think the taxpayer, Warren, will see a profit on that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Yes, the way it is going, they will show a profit, yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Charlie, do you think so?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Barely.    </p><p>      [laughter]  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  He hated to say that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: There's belief, trying to jump-start the economy, that if you get rid of onerous regulation -- not all regulation, but onerous regulation -- that businesses will invest more and grow more.  You guys own businesses, Lubrizol which is heavily regulated I'm sure, Burlington Northern the railroad heavily regulated.  The regulations -- if the regulations were diluted just a bit, would you invest more, that would mean more hiring and the economy would come back?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  The answer is no.  Sure there are regulations that don't make any sense out there and there always will be.  It is a very big complicated economy, but we are dying to make investments and we invested more money last year than we ever have in the history of Berkshire and we'll break that record again this year. American corporations have lots and lots and lots of liquidity, and where they see demand, they're going to invest in facilities that meet that demand.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: No matter what?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Absolutely.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Bill, in your high-tech field, what regulation do you think -- he just talked about regulations that should be banished but what regulation holds you back that you really feel shouldn't be there?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  I think the closest thing to that is whether or not an engineer who is trained in the United States but is a foreign citizen, it should be easy for them and they should be allowed to be a taxpayer here or they should be forced to go back and the jobs around them created in another country.  So the high-tech, high-skills immigration issue is one that definitely affects the job picture.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Senator John Kerry has the Startup Visa Act which would if there's a foreigner give them a green card if they have enough investment, they start a business, and they would hire some people, is that something, Charlie, you think is a good idea?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Yes, but I think Bill's idea is a much bigger idea.  I think we're out of our minds to send brilliant people back when they want to stay here.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I feel stronger about that than I used to.  I mean it is crazy.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  -- could be stronger.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  It just makes no sense.  Bill gave you the best answer you could have on it.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Why then do we have it, we make it so difficult with the H1B visa, which is the issue, would you say if you had the opportunity, Bill, to have the president's ear on that issue, surely he knows?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  There are various things that have not gotten through the Congress, you know, people want to make sure you're doing your best to hire American workers, and so there's a legitimate concern there.  But there's a way to be more liberal on this without at all substituting for domestic labor -- labor that you might have used.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You have a lot of people that are worried about -- they marry the issue of the border with Mexico with brilliant engineers who are coming from India and China.  Is there a way to separate that? Would it be a better idea, Charlie?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Of course it would be a better idea, of course it should be done.  This is a competitive world, you do not want to send the brains back.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  What bill is talking about would increase employment in the United States.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Brains.  You bought some brains in China, Charlie.  BYD, the electric car company, it is fun to see you two disagree on stage. You disagreed about the VAT tax.  Charlie thinks we should have a VAT tax.  Later, Warren, you told me you didn't think that was a good idea.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Right.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Going to electric vehicles, you feel, Charlie, that we should be giving government incentives and real carrots to inspire people to drive more electric vehicles; correct?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  We already do.  I have a niece and her husband who commute in Washington, D.C. and because they ride in a Prius, they get to use the fast lane.  That's a huge incentive.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  There's an incentive.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  There is a lot of incentive and there should be.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Should it be, Warren, at the expense because the money has to come from somewhere, at big oil, which is well-established and is getting a lot of tax breaks?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Charlie is the expert on this subject.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Should we sort of lessen what we have given to the oil companies over the years and switch it over to electric vehicles?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  I don't think the big problem of America is the oil companies have been favored too much.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You don't think that's a problem?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Yes, by and large.  Exxon is a technical meritocracy which is a very creditable place.  In other words, if more of America ran like Exxon, it would be a better country.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Let's get to Keystone, then.  The Keystone pipeline was rejected initially.  Now the new proposal from Transcanada is going. You are both Nebraska residents -- you live in California now, Charlie, but you're from Nebraska.  You are also business people.  The new route and when we get more details we will know but would you be for the Keystone pipeline if it doesn't threaten the aquifer and it doesn't threaten the areas that are culturally sensitive and environmentally sensitive?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I'm not an expert, but it generally sounds like it makes a lot of sense to me.  Awful lot of pipelines running through the United States.  Net, they have certainly been a huge plus for the country.  I don't know all the details on it, but based on what I know, I would say that it makes sense.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Were you then disappointed when Keystone was rejected, it could mean so many jobs?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I don't think that issue is done with yet.  The jobs aspect of it is not the big aspect.  The real question is what it will do for the country over many years and what the drawbacks are.  But you can build anything that will create jobs.  That doesn't mean it is a good idea.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Bill, you are invested in alternative energy and some of it a certain subsector of nuclear, but looking at natural gas, wow, it is so unbelievably inexpensive now and cleaner than oil, do you think this country should be converting to nat gas burning cars and trucks?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, natural gas, unfortunately, the energy density unless you take it to a very low temperature is much lower, so there's a lot of innovators looking at how can we do that better.  There are ways of converting natural gas to liquids, but those factories are very expensive so people are going to try to innovate.  There's such good news that we have inexpensive natural gas.  It is the most natural that we get the benefit of that in the power generation sector as we're turning over our power plants, but because the price is so attractive on an equivalent energy basis there will be innovations that move it into parts of the transport sector, that's very exciting.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Charlie, you said on stage this weekend we should not look for energy independence, we should use up the bad guys' energy --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Or the good guys, like Canada.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Or the good guys but conserve our own.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Right.  That to me is an obvious conclusion considering how precious this stuff is going to get.  Trying to use our whole supply, our reserves as fast as possible is insane.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  But you could arguably stick it to certain Arab nations who despise the United States and they despise Israel and make life difficult for everybody by completely turning off the spigot and not use their oil and then you hit them financially, no?        </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  My desire to do spiteful things to the Arab nations is zero. As long as they want to sell their oil, I'm delighted to see us buy it rather than use our own.  I think that adults suffer now to be better off later.  When you save your own oil, and buy the other fellows', that's what you're doing.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You drove an electric car, you said the most recent BYD, do you own an electric car?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  No.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  What do you drive, Charlie?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  A Mercedes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  What do you drive, Warren?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Cadillac.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Bill, what car do you usually use?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  I have a Mercedes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Two Mercedes.  Mercedes is buying advertising right now on Fox Business, so thank you very much, we hope.   </p><p>      [laughter]  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You both took swipes at business school this weekend which I thought was interesting.  You don't think they are teaching the right things.  Warren, you went to business school.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Apparently.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Columbia.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  And I had a fabulous teacher.  I went there because -- two fabulous teachers.  And I went there because two people that I really wanted to sit at their feet and I got a chance to do that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  And you're generous to business schools.  You host more than 40 of them every year --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  48.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  48, let them come here and take questions.  That's certainly wonderful.  What is it that business schools are doing wrong?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  Well, in the investment field I thought that over the last 40 or so years that most -- a great many business schools were teaching nonsense.  But that doesn't mean they were in other aspects of other majors within the business schools.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Bill, Charlie, would either of you make a decision to hire somebody based on whether the candidate had gone to business school?  Bill?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, if they are a young person, that's a recent part of their resume, so it might give them some valuable skills.  I don't think anybody is saying that business school doesn't have some merit to it.  It's just the -- how you do investment valuation as they have tried to apply mathematical techniques, they have claimed more than they should for these techniques.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I hired a young woman a couple years ago out of business school, and she would have been very good naturally, but I'm sure she was better because she'd gone to business school, but I didn't hire her for what she learned about investments in the business school.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Charlie?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  I said I thought the business schools were improving, which I think is true, including in the investment field, but they have a lot of room for it.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: The Buffett rule, that's getting so much attention. Charlie, what did you think when Warren pushed for the Buffett rule and has been quite vocal about it?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Well, it's caused me some lack of popularity at my country club, and I'm willing to bear it in order to participate in Berkshire.  I think it's fine if the rich people pay more taxes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Warren, you know --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>:  I think it's fine if he pays more taxes too.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Do you see the other side of it that, oh, the wealthy are the ones who are paying the biggest amount of taxes and that a large percentage of people don't pay any taxes aside from sales taxes, etcetera?  That whole argument.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>: Well the etcetera is payroll taxes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFETT</emphasis>: Payroll taxes are $800 billion of a $2.3 trillion dono -- revenue thing.  So payroll taxes are a huge element of our revenue base.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Charlie?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Well, I don't like the idea that nobody but the rich should pay taxes, because the country can't work on taxes from the rich people.  It won't produce enough.  And it would have terrible economic effects.  </p><p>      So I don't like this politics of envy style of -- of discourse.  </p><p>      But I think the rich people should cheerfully pay more taxes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  We already talked to Warren about the developments in Europe this morning, with France turning socialist with Francois Hollande, who's the Socialist president.  The U.S. banks, Warren, you said were in a far, far better position.  But both you and Charlie sat here a year ago on Fox Business and really were quite concerned about what would happen with Europe.  </p><p>      Can the European banks -- or at least some of them -- are they so weak that they can somehow systematically negatively affect U.S. banks or our banking system here, Charlie?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  I don't think it will have that much effect on us.  But I do think they still have a terrible problem.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Warren?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes, I agree with that.  But, obviously, it would have some effect, but as I say, I do not think our fate is in the hands of European banks.  And I'd worry very much if I were.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Well, they're all very cheap.  </p><p>      Are -- are you -- would you (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  They're not -- they're not necessarily cheap. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  So you're not considering buying any?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I -- I -- there's not a European bank that I'm looking at.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Not a European bank you're looking at.  Internationally, by virtue of the fact that you're huge in insurance in this -- in this company, we cannot ignore the risk that is lurking out of Iran and its plans for nuclear dependence and -- and perhaps eventually dominance.  </p><p>      Are you writing -- are any of your insurance companies writing any policies related to that risk of Iran?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  We exclude nuclear (INAUDIBLE).  But that's been true generally for a long time.  We exclude.  And the nuclear risk is one that all the resources of the insurance industry can't handle.  So it would be folly to write it, because people wouldn't get the protection they thought they were getting.  </p><p>      So nuclear is out of the question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Charlie, are you concerned about what is happening in Iran and -- and do you see an eventual military tension between U.S.- Iran or -- or Iran and Israel, which would eventually, perhaps, draw in the United States?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Well, I don't think I know much about how it's going to work.  And I am deeply suspicious of other people who claim to know what's going to happen exactly.  </p><p>      I think the future is often very hard to know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Trans -- we already talked about TransCanada.  </p><p>      Let's -- let's just quickly move on to your -- your lifestyle.  </p><p>      What newspapers or Web sites do you guys read every morning?  </p><p>      We have a lot of viewers who asked about this.  </p><p>      Bill, every morning, what do you reach for?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, I read \"New York Times,\" \"Wall Street Journal.\" \"The Economist\" is sort of my regular weekly fare.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  He -- he can give you last week's by memory.  He -- he knows every word.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  No, it's great, it's great to have something you read on a regular basis.  And they do special sections.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Charlie, what do you read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Well, I agree with Bill.  I think the best one publication I read is \"The Economist.\"..  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  -- which is interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes, well, I read that, but I -- I -- I read the local paper.  I read the \"FT.\" I read \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I read \"The New York Times\" and I -- and I read \"USA Today.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  What do you watch on TV?  </p><p>      People wanted to know that, aside from sports, because I know you're a big sports fan.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Yes, well, I watch sports and I watch the Sunday news shows and -- and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Is there one you prefer?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No, I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Do you try to (INAUDIBLE) all...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I watch them all.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  You watch them all?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I watch them all.  And I -- I have them taped and (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Oh, so you are technical?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  No, my wife does it.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  And -- oh, what else do I watch here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  I mean is there a show you think out there is clever?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, Comedy Ctrl is clever.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Oh, of course.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  It's certainly, in a political season, there's a lot to make fun of.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Speaking of which, one of our viewers, one of our, actually, our viewer Twitterers had asked, \"Who do you think might be a good vice presidential candidate for Mitt Romney?\"  </p><p>Charlie? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  I haven't the faintest idea.  I have some people I don't think should qualify.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Who?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  Oh, I'm not going to say.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I was hoping you'd ask him.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MUNGER</emphasis>:  It would be a long list.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Warren, what do you think?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  I think he shouldn't -- I think he would -- I think, largely, he will.  I think he should pick somebody who he thinks would be best qualified to serve as president of the United States if anything happened to him.  And -- and though people don't vote for the vice presidential candidate very -- to any great degree, so he can afford himself the luxury of doing that.  And I think that he probably is the kind of person that will.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Here's another Twitter person who wanted to know, \"What is the most significant motivator in your working life and how has that changed through the years?\"  </p><p>      Bill?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, I've kind of shifted from the innovations at Microsoft, which are great digital empowerment things, to helping the poorest.  And so figures like how many less children died this year than last year, you know, pretty exciting to see that we're getting that number down.  </p><p>      You know, there's still a lot of science (ph), but it's -- it's aimed at the poorest now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLAMAN</emphasis>:  Warren, your biggest motivator?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUFFET</emphasis>:  Oh, I -- just -- just running Berkshire is -- it's -- it's fun every day.  And it's a never finished painting.  And it's always got enough twists and turns in it to make it interesting.  </p><p>      So I know -- I know I'll have -- you know, I could -- I could be my age and retire and I could spend all week planning my haircut, you know.

And  as we look at how it's trading, it is up slightly, about .5 percent.</p><p>  What do you think of that trade?</p><p>  Do you think it would have been higher, lower?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, that doesn't change my conclusion, because of some half  a percent.  And, you know, I don't -- I have no idea whether Berkshire's  stock will go up or down in the next week or month or year.</p><p>  But in relation to the businesses we own, it -- it's attractive.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  One of the number one questions that came out this weekend --  it was interesting to me, because I've been coming six years and I have  never heard so many people ask why isn't Berkshire paying a dividend.  This  at a time when the largest percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies are now paying  dividends.  It's the first time in a long time that they are.</p><p>  And then you have the fact that you own dividend paying stocks like  Coca-Cola, American Express, Intel, which just raised its dividend this  morning, by the way.</p><p>  Why won't you pay a dividend to your shareholders?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, we think our shareholders, five years from now, will be  wealthier, counting what they would get from the reinvestment of the  dividend.  We think they would be -- they'll be wealthier if we hold onto  the money.</p><p>  Now, we may be wrong in that, but historically we've been right.  And  if -- if we had paid a dividend over the years our shareholders would be  considerably poorer than they -- 10 years ago.  And as long as we -- I  think we will have the opportunity to invest dollars, to create more than a  dollar of present value, we'll retain the money.  And when we don't think  we can do that we'll either repurchase stock or pay dividends.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Is there no way you will ever pay a dividend?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Oh, some day Berkshire will pay a dividend because it will  get so large that it can't use the money, or all of the money that it  earns, effectively.</p><p>  But -- but we don't think we're at that point, although we're much  closer to that point, obviously, than we were 20 years ago.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  I just mentioned that Coke pays a dividend.  Speaking of  Coke, the board is mulling a stock split.</p><p>  Would you be for a stock split of Coca-Cola?</p><p>  BUFFET:  I'm -- I'm totally neutral on that.  It's -- it's fine with  me if they do and it's fine with me if they don't.</p><p>  But it -- it won't make any difference to us in terms of the value of  our Coca-Cola stock.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  OK.  The succession plan was a very major focus here.  And  you said you'd be very clear about it.  You do finally have one person in  mind, with two back-ups.  I got you to tell us yesterday that it was a he.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  But it is a male?</p><p>  BUFFET:  It's a male.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  It is a male.  OK.  I talked to some shareholders who said it  is becoming increasingly evident to them that it's Ajit Jain, who runs your  insurance business.  Keep going with the poker-faced one, because they say  the insurance business is increasingly becoming the -- one of the major  important factors, the most important factors for the future of Berkshire  and the profits that it brings in.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Look, I would say this about the insurance business.  It's  been enormously important in getting us to where we are now.  It's still  enormously important.  It's actually not as important relative to the  entirety of Berkshire as it was 10 years ago.  We've added more businesses  away from insurance.</p><p>  But insurance has driven us to where we are presently.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  And the culture, you said he understands the culture of  Berkshire.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Oh, all three of the candidates understand the culture very  well.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  All right.  All three, but Ajit at the top?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Oh, I -- </p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  BUFFET:  When -- when we put you on the board, you'll know.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  OK.  All right.  Only the board knows.</p><p>  You also said about your successor that under your new successor,  there will not be much of a derivatives book under Berkshire's umbrella.</p><p>  Is that because you feel you really understand derivatives in a way  that nobody else does or that they've become dangerous for Berkshire?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Oh, it -- it -- there isn't that much of a derivatives book  right now, if you look at the total value of Berkshire.  We've done very  little in new revenues.  But we have a few and one particularly good sized  position in terms of our equity put situation.  Only that's nothing  compared to what we have in equities overall.</p><p>  So it's not a big deal now.  I would guess it would be a lesser deal.   And -- and partly that's because the rule -- in fact, in a big way that's  because the rules have been charged on derivatives.  We would not have the  derivatives position we have now if the rules had been the same five or 10  years ago in relation to posting of collateral.  We think that -- that  derivatives become much more dangerous for the individual enterprise when  they're required to post collateral.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  OK.  You're 81 years old.  That's not any news to anybody.   But the fact that you were diagnosed with Stage 1 prostate cancer gave some  people a start.  It is obviously non-aggressive.  And you say it's a non- issue.  And you won't miss a single day of work due to your treatment,  which starts in, what, July?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Mid-July.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Mid-July?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes.  Um-hmm.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  You won't miss any work at all?</p><p>  BUFFET:  No.  No.  No.  Maybe -- maybe 15 minutes a day, something  like that.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  CLAMAN:  We can lose you for 15 minutes.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, I wish -- I wish that we couldn't, but the truth is you  can't.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  CLAMAN:  But when you look at the -- the person who will eventually  take over, have you begun to apprentice your successor?</p><p>  BUFFET:  My -- my successor doesn't need apprenticing.  If they needed  apprenticing, they wouldn't be the successor (INAUDIBLE) -- </p><p>  CLAMAN:  They wouldn't be the one?</p><p>  BUFFET:  No.  In fact, none of the three candidates would need  apprenticing.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  In some of what you talked about, you talked about how great  some businesses are, but you talked about a big mistake.  Energy future -- </p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  CLAMAN:  -- from a Texas utility company.</p><p>  BUFFET:  All mine do.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  So sorry to bring it up.</p><p>  BUFFET:  I did it by myself.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  But these were tied very tightly to the price of natural gas.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Absolutely.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Which plummeted shortly after you bought it.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Right.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  How'd you get that so wrong?</p><p>  BUFFET:  It was easy.  I'll probably be able to do it again.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  BUFFET:  The -- it was -- it was -- it was just a case of not -- not  cranking that into my decision, weighting it with the appropriate  probability.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  But 2010, you had to do a $2 billion write up -- write-down;  2011, another $398 million write-down.</p><p>  How much -- </p><p>  BUFFET:  (INAUDIBLE) that total.  But the total -- the total we put in  was about $2 billion and -- and I think it's been written out of maybe $400  million or $500 million.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Well, how much was it going to get?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, it can go all the way to zero.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Do you think it will?</p><p>  BUFFET:  It -- it easily could.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Who -- who sold you on this idea, gold (INAUDIBLE) -- </p><p>  BUFFET:  Me.  Me.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Really?</p><p>  BUFFET:  No, no, no.</p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Goldman Sachs?</p><p>  BUFFET:  No, I -- I have -- I have a real ability to pick these --  pick these out.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  CLAMAN:  OK.</p><p>  One of the things you said that people sat on the edge of their seat,  because they want to know what you're buying, more newspapers.</p><p>  BUFFET:  It's possible.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Jimmy Kimmel told a joke at the Washington correspondents  dinner.  He said, what's black, white and red all over?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes, so I heard.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Nothing.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Yet you're buying now?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  And you said specifically local newspapers.</p><p>  How about \"The New York Times?\"</p><p>  Is that local enough?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, I -- if a -- I would have to say, if I could buy \"The  New York Times,\" I might buy it personally.  I -- I don't know whether I'd  buy it for Berkshire.  But it's not for sale.</p><p>  It's -- that's a very special case.</p><p>  The newspapers that exist in communities where there's a strong sense  of community and where the newspapers respond to that strong sense of  community by -- by telling people a whole lot of things that they want to  know about their own community that they can't find some place else, those  newspapers will do OK.  They'll still be in decline over time.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  But is it that you see that their value is relatively -- that  their price is relatively cheap to earnings?</p><p>  BUFFET:  In some cases.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Um-hmm.</p><p>  BUFFET:  In some cases.  But the earnings are not going to -- the  earnings are not going to go up.  I mean you're looking -- and -- and  they're probably going to go down in most -- in practically all cases.</p><p>  So you have to buy them at a value, actually, that takes that into  account.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  \"The Washington Post,\" you stepped down from the board.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Right.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  But you still fully own your position?</p><p>  BUFFET:  We own every share we've ever owned.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Even though it's off its 52 week highs.</p><p>  Do you feel it's doing pretty well?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, it -- I don't know whether they've published their  first quarter earnings yet or not.  But -- but they have problems in two of  their businesses, one in the education business and one in the newspaper.   And -- and that's been reflected, I think, in the price.</p><p>  But those two businesses are -- well, the newspaper is far tougher  than it was five or 10 years ago.  And the education business is tougher  than it was about two years ago.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  What's interesting to people, though, when you say that you  would buy more newspapers is at a time when everybody else is getting out,  it seems like you and Rupert Murdoch are the only people getting into  newspapers.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes, right.  And he may not be quite as competitive for a  while, either.  So, no.  But they are not a -- it's not an industry whose  earnings are going to -- the earnings are going to just shrink in the  newspaper business, as are the revenues.  But not -- I don't necessarily  think they'll shrink at a dramatic rate where you have a strong feeling of  community and you have a newspaper that serves that community well.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  \"The Washington Post\" reported Friday and their revenue -- </p><p>  BUFFET:  Did they?</p><p>  OK.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  -- fell.</p><p>  Yes, their revenue fell.  Well, speaking of Rupert Murdoch, because I  brought it up, hoc, is the head of News Corp, the parent of Fox Business.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Sure.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  You -- you made a little quip about our sister network, Fox.   One shareholder questioned whether your personal politics -- </p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  -- hurt shares of the company.  And your response was, \"I  really think someone making an investment decision based on the politics of  whether he agrees or not with the CEO, sounds to me like he ought to own  Fox.\"</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  BUFFET:  I'll leave it at that.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  CLAMAN:  What -- what do you mean by that?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, I mean, I think it's silly to make a decision -- </p><p>  CLAMAN:  Right.</p><p>  BUFFET:  -- based on the politics of the CEO.  I -- I can't tell you  the politics of the CEOs of our major investments.  There may be one or two  that I would know about, but it is absolutely a zero factor in our making a  decision on a business.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  I guess maybe people were really meaning that they're in  contradiction, they feel differently about the Buffett Rule than you do.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Right.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  You clarified in September to Fox Business News that what you  meant was the uber rich should pay a commensurate tax rate of about 30  percent, that a let -- a lot of the rest of Americans are paying.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Right.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Yet the Buffet -- yet the Obama administration kind of took  it in a different way and is now promoting it for people who make a million  dollars or more.</p><p>  Have you talked to the president about how he's split from what you  really intended?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, that isn't really different than what I intended.  I  mean, I might tweak it a little bit in one direction or another.  But I was  talking about the people making a million or more.</p><p>  Now I would probably have a different break, also, for the people  making $10 million or more.</p><p>  But the -- Senator Whitehouse is the one that put the bill in.  And I  wrote him a letter immediately after he did so that in -- I -- I basically  approve of his bill.  If I were writing the bill, I'd write it a little --  slightly different, but so would everybody else.</p><p>  But I -- I think it -- it gets at the -- it gets at the point that 131  out of 400 of the highest incomes in the country, those 400 incomes average  $270 million each.  That's not bad.  That's, you know, almost three  quarters of a million dollars a day.  And -- </p><p>  CLAMAN:  We'd take it.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes.  And a -- a third of those people paid less than a 15  percent rate, combined payroll and income tax.</p><p>  And I -- I think -- I think that's wrong and I think it -- and in an  economy where we're going to ask for shared sacrifice of people, that we  ought to go after the (INAUDIBLE).  It doesn't solve the revenue problem.</p><p>  But I think that people want a code that has at least that much  fairness in it.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  But, Warren, if you feel so strongly about that, why not take  a bigger salary than you always have?</p><p>  You've always opted to take your income in cash -- in -- in Berkshire  stock versus cash.</p><p>  Yet if you took a bigger salary instead, you could pay that 30 percent  rate.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Why not have done it that way?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, the company would get a deduction, too.  So the  government would be -- would be worse off rather than wise (ph), actually,  because the company would get a 35 percent deduction if they paid it to me.</p><p>  So it's -- it -- it wouldn't change the revenue, it would just take  some money from the shareholders.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Here's what -- what I heard from some other people, too, is  they said, you know, when you're donating most of your -- your money to the  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is philanthropic and wonderful and  yet that will keep it from being taxed.</p><p>  And some would say, why not then let it be taxed, because it --  wouldn't it be helpful to give it as revenue to the government?</p><p>  BUFFET:  That would be an alternative.  But I -- I think that we will  probably be able to accomplish a lot more around the world with that money  going to the foundation.</p><p>  But it -- it's a wonderful tax dodge.  I urge all you -- all the  viewers if they -- if they want to pay less tax, they should give away more  money.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Investments -- what other countries are you investing in?</p><p>  You mentioned an acquisition in the Netherlands.</p><p>  But what other countries' companies are starting to look good to you?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, we don't really look by country.  That -- that company  in the Netherlands was for sale.  I mean the owners of it decided to sell  it a month or so ago and -- and we ended up buying it last week.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Right.</p><p>  BUFFET:  But we don't look much by country.  It -- we -- we really  look for businesses we understand, with some kind of competitive advantage  and good management and a price that makes sense.</p><p>  And if we find that -- we found, you know, the most wonderful of all  in Israel six or seven years ago.  And we've -- we can find them here in  the United States, usually.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  And that was ISCAR?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Absolutely.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  You said that there was a $22 billion deal that you missed by  that much.  You couldn't get that deal done.  You wouldn't say what sector  it was in.</p><p>  Can you say what country it was in?</p><p>  BUFFET:  No, it was -- but it was on this planet.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  CLAMAN:  I tried.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, you narrowed it down.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  How does Brazil look for investment right now?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, I -- I -- </p><p>  CLAMAN:  See anything you like in Brazil?</p><p>  BUFFET:  I -- </p><p>  CLAMAN:  How about that?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Well, I don't know that much about specific -- (INAUDIBLE).   I mean, if we found something that was interesting in Brazil, some business  I understood, it was large, the price was right.  The management was right,  we'd buy it in a second.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  You have bought some European stocks recently.</p><p>  BUFFET:  That is true.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Which ones?</p><p>  I mean it's going to come out in an SEC filing eventually, won't it?</p><p>  BUFFET:  No, actually, we don't have to report the foreign stocks.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  You don't have to report it?</p><p>  BUFFET:  No.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  So you won't say?</p><p>  BUFFET:  No, that's true.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  OK.  But would you say, 10, 11, 12 coun -- companies?</p><p>  BUFFET:  It was about -- I think it was more like nine.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Nine?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Um-hmm.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  This morning, folks, when Warren Buffet arrived here at our  shoot, he quickly went upstairs to put in stock orders.</p><p>  European stock orders?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Not today.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Not today.</p><p>  So at -- U.S. equities?</p><p>  BUFFET:  That's what's left, yes.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  BUFFET:  Because I did say it was on this planet, yes.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  U.S. equities look cheap then at this point, with the markets  the way they are today?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Some do.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Some do.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Some do, sure.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Let's talk about the news of the weekend, as well.  Nicolas  Sarkozy is out in France.</p><p>  BUFFET:  He's out.  Yes.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  And Francois Hollande, who is, of course, a Socialist, is in.</p><p>  This is disconcerting to a lot of people who wonder, will we see  capital flight away from France, the likes of what we saw when Francois  Mitterand, who was also a Socialist, was elected years ago.</p><p>  Will people take their money out of France?</p><p>  Do you predict that or could you see that?</p><p>  BUFFET:  I -- I don't know the answer to that.  I -- I would not be  enthused if I had a Socialist win anyplace.  But -- but the -- I think the  problems facing Europe transcend, almost, you know, those in any specific  country.  I mean they have to work out the rules under which 17 countries  can really work together.  When they lock themselves into a monetary unit.   And they haven't locked themselves in in a number of other ways.</p><p> So, I think overall what happens in Europe is probably maybe affected by  the leaders in given countries, but it's going to be much more important  than any specific election.</p><p> CLAMAN: You just said locked into a specific currency.  Was the euro idea a  mistake?  </p><p>  BUFFETT: Getting out of it would be an enormous problem, too, but I  think maybe it was a mistake.  As it was done.  In fact, I can say it was a  mistake as it was done.  Now the question is whether you can modify the  original concept in some way that makes this more workable than it is  proving to be.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Well, as it morphs and changes, Greece has parliamentary elections  and neo-Nazis were elected to the parliament.  Is it just a matter of time  before Greece either leaves or gets jettisoned from the euro zone?  </p><p>  BUFFETT:  I don't know about - I think it's a matter of time until  they come up with a better solution than the present structure or they  abandon it entirely. Who knows which it will happen?</p><p> CLAMAN: Forty-seven years later from you starting your company, you finally  invested in a technology stock or two.  IBM and Intel --  </p><p>  BUFFETT:  Yes, I didn't - I didn't do the Intel.</p><p> CLAMAN: You didn't do the Intel. You did the IMB.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Yes. </p><p> CLAMAN:  Who did the Intel?</p><p>  BUFFETT: Yes, it would have been Todd because he was the only one - </p><p> CLAMAN:  OK.  Todd did -- Todd Holmes, who is one of your new investment  managers.  It was his idea. But you never bought Microsoft.  Did you hear  from your board member Bill Gates about that?  </p><p>  BUFFETT: I can't buy -- I can't buy Microsoft.  If we bought  Microsoft, for one thing, our buying days take place month after month  after month.  And if something happened that was favorable at Microsoft,  people would have said I had insider information.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Well, actually, let's bring in Bill Gates right now, who founded  Microsoft - </p><p> BUFFETT:  Maybe he'll give me some insider information!</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BUFFETT:  Now's the time. </p><p> CLAMAN: What's inside information at Microsoft (ph)? </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CLAMAN:  When you heard that he finally bought a technology stock and IBM  and Intel, did you think those were pretty good ideas?  </p><p>  BILL GATES, FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: Well, I think it is great that Todd  gets the entire universe to exercise his great thinking.  And he has done a  good job there.  </p><p> A lot of technology companies, you can't see where they will be in 10 years  or 20 years.  IBM has enough service revenue that they may be somewhat of  an exception to that. But most tech stocks, you know, play a very high- variance game, which makes it I think the most interesting in the street in  the world.  But not for an investor who wants any degree of downside  protection.  </p><p>  BUFFETT: He told me that when I met him in 1991, too.  </p><p> And what point should be made about Todd. Todd can change his positions  far, far easier than I can.  So, Todd is working with sums.  If he decides  to move onto something else, he can - he can do that.  I can't do that with  the big positions that we take.  So, we are really locked in more than he  would be.</p><p> CLAMAN: Bill, you just said that with many tech stocks, you can't see where  they will be in ten to 20 years.  Can you see, Warren, where Facebook would  be in 10 to 20 years?  </p><p>  BUFFETT: No, no I can't.  I mean, it is an enormously impressive  accomplishment.   And my guess is it has a big future of some sort.  But I have no idea.  I  didn't even know what it was six or seven years ago.  And I'm still not on  it, so - </p><p> CLAMAN: Bill, are you on Facebook?  </p><p> GATES: Sure. </p><p> CLAMAN: You are on Twitter as well.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  He's in a different world. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CLAMAN:  Always have been.  In fact, I  remember when you were saying Bill  had to teach you how to just simply click on the blue E for Explorer.  </p><p>  BUFFETT:  He's had his problems with me. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  GATES:  Well, Warren's a big tech user (ph) if you count online  bridge.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  That's right. </p><p> GATES:  That takes him up into the top one percent in terms of Internet  addicts.  </p><p>  BUFFETT:  I'm like a guy who's (INAUDIBLE) to turn on the switch.  And  then, as far as I'm concerned, there's some guy inside that thing that's  playing - (INAUDIBLE). </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CLAMAN: Listen, let's talk about Facebook.  It's huge news today.  The  beginning of the road show.  </p><p> Bill, you have been dealing with investors and analysts for years and banks  for years and years.  Would you tell Mark Zuckerberg -- because there is  question as to whether he will attend the road show.  Would you say, you  know, you really should get out there and do it?  </p><p>  GATES:  I know when Microsoft had to do its road show, I minimized the  amount of time.  I think I offered three days, I told them no limousines.   I took a book about biology.  I was reading during the breaks.  I tried not  to have it take too much time away from the business.  You know, so, you've  got to focus on what is important in making sure your profit friend (ph)  users is great -- as number one</p><p>  BUFFETT:  This is a guy that negotiated down with his mother  (INAUDIBLE) down to an hour over the time he was willing to spend with me. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>  GATES:  Well, I didn't know what I was in for.  I thought -- </p><p> CLAMAN: Didn't want to spend more than an hour with Buffett?  Your mom said  meet the guy, and --</p><p>  GATES:  Before Warren and I met, I wasn't sure we had that much to  talk about.  Now, I was 100 percent wrong about that, but my mom made me  say I would stay a few hours at this event that Kay, Graham and Warren were  at.  In fact, I stayed the whole day, and I was disappointed when Warren  was leaving because talking about business and the dynamics of how things  were changing I found somebody I'm part of -- one of the most interesting  parts of my life.  A lifelong conversation. </p><p> BUFFETT:  His mom was prying us apart at the end. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CLAMAN: What would you advise Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook to attend that  road show?  </p><p>  BUFFETT:  I wouldn't worry too much.  I mean - you know, that offering  was going to be big.  I'm not saying the stock is going to go, but it is  going to get all the attention in the world.  And people know what Facebook  is.  I mean, it's not a mystery that has to be explained.</p><p> CLAMAN: Can it --</p><p> BUFFETT:  Except to me!</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CLAMAN:  If -- if it does have $100 billion valuation or whatever the crazy  numbers are out there, can it sustain that? What does it need to do to  sustain that?  What does it need to do to sustain that, Bill?</p><p>  GATES: Well, it just needs to have advertising revenue that makes that  earnings dream properly discounted be greater than $100 billion. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GATES:  And -</p><p> CLAMAN:  Simple! </p><p> GATES: It's right there in \"The Intelligent Investor\"!</p><p> You know, they have a lot of traffic.  And the ability to monetize that  traffic over time will be fascinating to see if they can push up and go  beyond the earnings stream you need for that or not.  But it is one  phenomenally impressive company.</p><p> CLAMAN: Bill, everybody is always talking about the succession plan.  And  you know, you went through this very  issue back when you decided to leave  the CEO position at Microsoft.  The stock has done really well lately, and  Windows 8 is about to blast onto the scene.  And I hear from -- Recover  Silicon Valley heavily at Fox Business.  And I hear from them that once  Windows 8 gets into the ultra-books and it becomes  a touch screen, you  could very well take on the Mac Air and the MacBook.  </p><p> Is that what Microsoft should be aiming for, and do you think it could  happen with Ultra Books?  </p><p>  GATES:  Well, it is very exciting that Windows 8 is coming out.  It's  a very big deal for the company.  Steve and the whole team are doing a  great job there.  It creates a new category of machines that are sort of --  have the good things about tablets and the good things about PCs.  And so,  it's going to evolve these digital tools. </p><p> You know, people right now like the tablet, but it's hard to - </p><p> CLAMAN:  Type on. </p><p> GATES:  -- to give input.  You don't have Microsoft Office on there.  And  so, with our hardware partners, there's a lot of neat stuff that comes out  later year.</p><p> CLAMAN: Warren, what kind of computer do you use?  </p><p>  BUFFETT: I think it's an HP that the guys at the furniture market (ph)  sent over.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Well, what do you use, Bill?</p><p>  GATES:  Well, I have a Samsung tablet is my primary machine, but I  have Dell machines and a variety.  I'm always getting the latest and  greatest. </p><p> CLAMAN: So, no iPad for you.</p><p>  GATES:  No, no, -- I said I am using the latest and greatest.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  BUFFETT:  Bill has -- they have a chimpanzee up there in Seattle, and  then they have me and then they have us both test these new things.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> And, actually, I am more reliable than the chimpanzee.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Do you have an iPad, Warren?</p><p>  BUFFETT:  No.  </p><p> CLAMAN: No.  So, you're not going for the tablet at this point.  </p><p> Bill, let's just say the Samsung Galaxy has gone traction, but not nearly  as much as the iPad has.  Rim couldn't come out with a tablet that smacked  it down nor hp.  </p><p> What company out there has the special something that can take on that iPad  in your opinion?  </p><p>  GATES:  Well, the tablets base is going to grow, but you really want  something where you either have a pen or keyboard and you have your  productivity applications.  So, you want the best of both worlds, and that  is what Microsoft and others are pushing for. </p><p> I think this fall, people will understand that there is room for big  improvement there.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Microsoft just made a pretty big deal, about $300 million with  Barnes &amp; Noble.  Will eventually that morph into a deal to make some type  of tablet or a Kindle with Microsoft abilities to jack it up?  </p><p>  GATES:  Well, the idea is they are going to take their reading  experience and books and make them look super good on these new devices.   And so, on these devices, you want to run Office where you create  documents.  But you want to consume books in new ways, consume videos in  new ways.  And so, it's that merger and having their team do innovative  work is what made that investment a smart idea.</p><p> CLAMAN: Warren, you said this weekend you would not buy Apple.  </p><p>  BUFFETT:  Well, I said I wouldn't know enough to buy Apple.  Yes.  But  no, I'm not going to buy anything I don't feel I can have a reasonable fix  on what they will look like in five or ten years.  And I certainly didn't  have a reasonable fix - I wish I had -- ten years ago on Apple but I don't  have one now.  </p><p> I think it's an amazing company.  But there are lots of businesses I don't  understand.</p><p> CLAMAN: Bill, tech companies have gotten so desperate to have the latest  and greatest technology that they are trying to buy in in patents.  They're  trying to buy chunks of patents, you know, with the Motorola mobility  issue.  Today, a judge is going to consider, I believe, that Microsoft's  complaint that Motorola is charging for what really should be basic  technology patents.  </p><p> Have the patent wars gotten a little out of hand?  </p><p>  GATES:  No, I think the idea that invention is valuable has become  more obvious.  It was always true in the drug industry that the whole  industry, these miracle medicine exists, because patents were protecting  that invention.  </p><p> And fortunately, we are seeing more invention in many areas.  The IT sector  has got a lot, but you know, if you come up with a renewable energy design,  that is going to be protected by a patent.  </p><p> So, patents are important.  There are immensely complex, and sometimes when  people look at it either because of the complexity of the system because  they haven't looked into it, it seems strange to them. But the idea that  invention has value - I think that  is an idea that is more and more  important over time.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Warren?</p><p>  BUFFETT:  Oh, I agree.  I just don't know how to invent anything.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CLAMAN: There have been a couple of corporate scandals.  Among them, Apple  and Foxconn.  Foxconn is one of the manufacturers of components of Apple's  products.  They were accused of mistreating their workers and in some cases  underpaying them. </p><p> Did Apple handle that right?  Would you care if you found out that one of  your companies under the Berkshire umbrella was buying a lot of stuff from  people who mistreated their workers?  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Sure, and we hope that all our companies are looking at all kinds  of things including that.  But f you have a very, very large company  something is going to go wrong.  And right now I can tell you with 270,000  employees at Berkshire, someone is doing something they shouldn't.   I just  hope it is small, I hope we find out about it, and then I hope whoever is  in charge does something about it properly but you cannot run a large army  or a large government bureau or large church without things going wrong  from time to time.  It's going to happen.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  It is going to happen but this Foxconn issue was out there.  Wired  Magazine a year and a half ago had a huge front-page story about it, Bill.   I'm just wondering -- had that ever happened to you at Microsoft?  Would  you look at that and say Apple really should have dealt with that much more  quickly?  </p><p> GATES:  I think American companies overall are improving labor conditions  when they're involved in whether it is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or  really looking down the supply chain at trying to make sure labor  conditions are okay, I think American business has had a positive effect.   I don't know specifics of the Apple case but I know they are not going to  try to take shortcuts in that way.  They are certainly very focused on  fixing any problems at this point.  </p><p> CLAMAN: You mentioned the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  That's pretty  controversial with Wal-Mart lately and a lot of people saying hey, that is  how you get business done in Mexico.  What is your response to that?  </p><p> BUFFETT:  My responses is that we have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  It  may very well be that's the way business is done in Mexico but you'd better  not do it if you are an American corporation.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Maybe the crime was less important than the cover-up.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  It's always a problem.  I mean, I know something's being done  that's wrong at Berkshire, I can't tell what it is and --</p><p> CLAMAN:  But Warren, if somebody came to you and you knew about it, like  the Wal-Mart top executives did, would you say \"don't be so aggressive on  that?\" </p><p> BUFFETT:  No, but I think almost all CEOs when they know the facts - - it  certainly seems quite clear there was bribery in all of that.  Exactly what  happened after that, I'm not sure about, but I would think there are very  few American CEOs that if they find out about some problems, they're going  to try to figure out something to do and something about them promptly.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Bill, earlier we were talking with Warren about how he wants to  buy more newspapers.  </p><p> GATES:  He's not going to compete with me.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  You are not going to buy newspapers?  Because he got the idea to  buy railroads back in 2006 from you.  You were already in a Canadian  railroad.  </p><p> GATES:  No, Warren's has been playing with railroads since he was a boy.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  That's right.  </p><p> GATES:  I can hardly take credit for introducing him to that whole sector  of the economy.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  I'm repeating what he told me.  </p><p> GATES:  He's very generous.  We both made good money.  We're happy railroad  investors.  </p><p> CLAMAN: You both -- and I knew this about Warren, but I didn't know you  used to be a newspaper delivery boy.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Absolutely.  I was far better than Warren.  It's really one of  those things that needs more coverage.  </p><p> [laughter] </p><p> BUFFETT:  I was there yesterday, he didn't show up.  </p><p> [laughter] </p><p> CLAMAN: We got video of it.  There was a newspaper throwing contest where  we all tossed Omaha World Heralds to the porch of a Clayton home.  </p><p> GATES:  Exactly.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  I was stunned to see, here's Warren, you made it right to the  porch, and then Bill exactly in the same position, that little boy is one  of your grandsons.  </p><p> GATES:  He won that.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  I own the house and the newspaper, I better be close enough.  </p><p> [laughter] </p><p> GATES:  When it came to ping-pong, I would say I was a little better.   We're 1 to 1 for the weekend.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  That's right.  </p><p> [CROSSTALK]</p><p> CLAMAN:  2 on 1.  Then you brought up the gigantic paddle.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  That didn't work either.  [laughter] </p><p> CLAMAN:  In the past you've done a lot of things.  You've danced with the  Nebraska cheerleaders.  You've ridden a bull.  That must have been  incredible.  Back then when you were doing it, you were in your 70s.  They  are both looking at the monitor.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Absolutely.  I look as bad as I look there as I do here.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Charlie, your vice chairman, never participates in sitting on the  bull or throwing the newspapers, why not?  </p><p> BUFFETT:  He's the thinker in the group.  </p><p> [laughter] </p><p> CLAMAN:  In fact here he is, Charlie Munger, the vice chair of Berkshire  Hathaway, joining us now.  Good morning Charlie.  Welcome to the party  here.  </p><p> CHARLIE MUNGER, VICE CHAIR, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY:  Thank you.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Charlies, there was so much focus this weekend on Warren's health  and his succession plan and how much longer Warren will be running the  company.  Let's turn it to you, how much longer will you be up on stage  with Warren for these annual shareholder meetings?  </p><p> MUNGER:  I serve a very important function because people look at me and  think they will get another seven years out of Warren.  I don't think he's  anxious to get rid of me.</p><p> [laughter] </p><p> BUFFETT:  I'm there to show there's some guy older than me in American  business.  Makes me look very good when I'm up there.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  How much longer will you participate?  Somebody said is this  Charlie's last year?  </p><p> MUNGER:  No.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Well, I hope not.  </p><p> CLAMAN: You have every plan to remain on the stage at these meetings?  </p><p> MUNGER:  I'm not going to sit up there drooling.  But I plan to be there.   If the only way to get up is to drool, then I'll drool.</p><p> CLAMAN:  You were as feisty as ever.  One comment you made got a round of  applause from the audience that was on the mortgage and lending bubble.   And you said this -- this is stuff you have said over the past couple of  years, but you've never phrased it like this before, you said it was wrong  not to stamp down on felony and folly of all that irresponsible lending,  quote I often say \"Alan Greenspan overdosed on Ayn Rand.\"  Meaning the  whole free market hands-off approach was a total disaster?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Certainly.  Most of these have limits.  In other words, an ax  murderer is not a good thing because it happens in a free market.  There's  a limit to when the free market is -- [inaudible] a free market with that  kind of fraud and folly it is not wise to allow it.  We were disgraceful to  sit there and let Canada be sensible while we went crazy.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  I would say this in, in fairness to Alan Greenspan and Charlie  has made this point that he has said that he's sort of overestimated --  overestimated the ability of the free market to natural operations to rein  in -- all the self-interest that -- </p><p> MUNGER:  Yes, Alan Greenspan is the only person who has apologized.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Who else should apologize?  </p><p> MUNGER:  There's a big list, practically everybody.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Banks, U.S. banks?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Oh, my God, yes.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Dodd Frank, now we have that, but the last numbers I looked at, it  is 850 pages long.  The Volcker Rule alone breaks down to 380 plus  questions and those have more than 1400 sub-questions.  Will that be the  thing that prevents us from dealing with this type of disaster again?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Well, it was certainly a step in the right direction.  If I had  the power, I would have made the Volcker act look like a non-restraint.  I  would have done much more.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  So you think that preventing banks from investing in the  proprietary trading issue?  They are all complaining, Charlie, that that's  ruining their ability to do well and do well for shareholders.  </p><p> MUNGER:  Well, that's natural when people were making a lot of money out of  something to not want to be forced out of it.  These banks ought to only be  open on Christmas.  They ought to have a fairly restricted repertoire.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Well, we the taxpayers bailed out a lot of them, including AIG.   In the news today is the Treasury Department will try and sell off more  taxpayer holdings of AIG.  Do you think the bailout of AIG was something we  had to do?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Probably.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Do you think the taxpayer, Warren, will see a profit on that?  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Yes, the way it is going, they will show a profit, yes.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Charlie, do you think so?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Barely.  </p><p> [laughter] </p><p> BUFFETT:  He hated to say that.  </p><p> CLAMAN: There's belief, trying to jump-start the economy, that if you get  rid of onerous regulation -- not all regulation, but onerous regulation --  that businesses will invest more and grow more.  You guys own businesses,  Lubrizol which is heavily regulated I'm sure, Burlington Northern the  railroad heavily regulated.  The regulations -- if the regulations were  diluted just a bit, would you invest more, that would mean more hiring and  the economy would come back?  </p><p> MUNGER:  The answer is no.  Sure there are regulations that don't make any  sense out there and there always will be.  It is a very big complicated  economy, but we are dying to make investments and we invested more money  last year than we ever have in the history of Berkshire and we'll break  that record again this year. American corporations have lots and lots and  lots of liquidity, and where they see demand, they're going to invest in  facilities that meet that demand.  </p><p> CLAMAN: No matter what?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Absolutely.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Bill, in your high-tech field, what regulation do you think -- he  just talked about regulations that should be banished but what regulation  holds you back that you really feel shouldn't be there?  </p><p> GATES:  I think the closest thing to that is whether or not an engineer who  is trained in the United States but is a foreign citizen, it should be easy  for them and they should be allowed to be a taxpayer here or they should be  forced to go back and the jobs around them created in another country.  So  the high-tech, high-skills immigration issue is one that definitely affects  the job picture.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Senator John Kerry has the Startup Visa Act which would if there's  a foreigner give them a green card if they have enough investment, they  start a business, and they would hire some people, is that something,  Charlie, you think is a good idea?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Yes, but I think Bill's idea is a much bigger idea.  I think we're  out of our minds to send brilliant people back when they want to stay here.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  I feel stronger about that than I used to.  I mean it is crazy.  </p><p> MUNGER:  -- could be stronger.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  It just makes no sense.  Bill gave you the best answer you could  have on it.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Why then do we have it, we make it so difficult with the H1B visa,  which is the issue, would you say if you had the opportunity, Bill, to have  the president's ear on that issue, surely he knows?  </p><p> GATES:  There are various things that have not gotten through the Congress,  you know, people want to make sure you're doing your best to hire American  workers, and so there's a legitimate concern there.  But there's a way to  be more liberal on this without at all substituting for domestic labor --  labor that you might have used.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  You have a lot of people that are worried about -- they marry the  issue of the border with Mexico with brilliant engineers who are coming  from India and China.  Is there a way to separate that?  Would it be a  better idea, Charlie?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Of course it would be a better idea, of course it should be done.   This is a competitive world, you do not want to send the brains back.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  What bill is talking about would increase employment in the  United States.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Brains.  You bought some brains in China, Charlie.  BYD, the  electric car company, it is fun to see you two disagree on stage.  You  disagreed about the VAT tax.  Charlie thinks we should have a VAT tax.   Later, Warren, you told me you didn't think that was a good idea.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Right.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Going to electric vehicles, you feel, Charlie, that we should be  giving government incentives and real carrots to inspire people to drive  more electric vehicles; correct?  </p><p> MUNGER:  We already do.  I have a niece and her husband who commute in  Washington, D.C. and because they ride in a Prius, they get to use the fast  lane.  That's a huge incentive.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  There's an incentive.  </p><p> MUNGER:  There is a lot of incentive and there should be.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Should it be, Warren, at the expense because the money has to come  from somewhere, at big oil, which is well-established and is getting a lot  of tax breaks?  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Charlie is the expert on this subject.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Should we sort of lessen what we have given to the oil companies  over the years and switch it over to electric vehicles?  </p><p> MUNGER:  I don't think the big problem of America is the oil companies have  been favored too much.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  You don't think that's a problem?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Yes, by and large.  Exxon is a technical meritocracy which is a  very creditable place.  In other words, if more of America ran like Exxon,  it would be a better country.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Let's get to Keystone, then.  The Keystone pipeline was rejected  initially.  Now the new proposal from Transcanada is going.  You are both  Nebraska residents -- you live in California now, Charlie, but you're from  Nebraska.  You are also business people.  The new route and when we get  more details we will know but would you be for the Keystone pipeline if it  doesn't threaten the aquifer and it doesn't threaten the areas that are  culturally sensitive and environmentally sensitive?  </p><p> BUFFETT:  I'm not an expert, but it generally sounds like it makes a lot of  sense to me.  Awful lot of pipelines running through the United States.   Net, they have certainly been a huge plus for the country.  I don't know  all the details on it, but based on what I know, I would say that it makes  sense.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Were you then disappointed when Keystone was rejected, it could  mean so many jobs?  </p><p> BUFFETT:  I don't think that issue is done with yet.  The jobs aspect of it  is not the big aspect.  The real question is what it will do for the  country over many years and what the drawbacks are.  But you can build  anything that will create jobs.  That doesn't mean it is a good idea.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Bill, you are invested in alternative energy and some of it a  certain subsector of nuclear, but looking at natural gas, wow, it is so  unbelievably inexpensive now and cleaner than oil, do you think this  country should be converting to nat gas burning cars and trucks?  </p><p> GATES:  Well, natural gas, unfortunately, the energy density unless you  take it to a very low temperature is much lower, so there's a lot of  innovators looking at how can we do that better.  There are ways of  converting natural gas to liquids, but those factories are very expensive  so people are going to try to innovate.  There's such good news that we  have inexpensive natural gas.  It is the most natural that we get the  benefit of that in the power generation sector as we're turning over our  power plants, but because the price is so attractive on an equivalent  energy basis there will be innovations that move it into parts of the  transport sector, that's very exciting.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Charlie, you said on stage this weekend we should not look for  energy independence, we should use up the bad guys' energy -- </p><p> MUNGER:  Or the good guys, like Canada.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Or the good guys but conserve our own.  </p><p> MUNGER:  Right.  That to me is an obvious conclusion considering how  precious this stuff is going to get.  Trying to use our whole supply, our  reserves as fast as possible is insane.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  But you could arguably stick it to certain Arab nations who  despise the United States and they despise Israel and make life difficult  for everybody by completely turning off the spigot and not use their oil  and then you hit them financially, no? </p><p> MUNGER:  My desire to do spiteful things to the Arab nations is zero.  As  long as they want to sell their oil, I'm delighted to see us buy it rather  than use our own.  I think that adults suffer now to be better off later.   When you save your own oil, and buy the other fellows', that's what you're  doing.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  You drove an electric car, you said the most recent BYD, do you  own an electric car?  </p><p> MUNGER:  No.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  What do you drive, Charlie?  </p><p> MUNGER:  A Mercedes.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  What do you drive, Warren?  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Cadillac.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Bill, what car do you usually use?  </p><p> GATES:  I have a Mercedes.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Two Mercedes.  Mercedes is buying advertising right now on Fox  Business, so thank you very much, we hope.  </p><p> [laughter] </p><p> CLAMAN:  You both took swipes at business school this weekend which I  thought was interesting.  You don't think they are teaching the right  things.  Warren, you went to business school.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Apparently.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Columbia.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  And I had a fabulous teacher.  I went there because -- two  fabulous teachers.  And I went there because two people that I really  wanted to sit at their feet and I got a chance to do that.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  And you're generous to business schools.  You host more than 40 of  them every year -- </p><p> BUFFETT:  48.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  48, let them come here and take questions.  That's certainly  wonderful.  What is it that business schools are doing wrong?  </p><p> BUFFETT:  Well, in the investment field I thought that over the last 40 or  so years that most -- a great many business schools were teaching nonsense.   But that doesn't mean they were in other aspects of other majors within the  business schools.  </p><p> CLAMAN: Bill, Charlie, would either of you make a decision to hire somebody  based on whether the candidate had gone to business school?  Bill?  </p><p> GATES:  Well, if they are a young person, that's a recent part of their  resume, so it might give them some valuable skills.  I don't think anybody  is saying that business school doesn't have some merit to it.  It's just  the -- how you do investment valuation as they have tried to apply  mathematical techniques, they have claimed more than they should for these  techniques.  </p><p> BUFFETT:  I hired a young woman a couple years ago out of business school,  and she would have been very good naturally, but I'm sure she was better  because she'd gone to business school, but I didn't hire her for what she  learned about investments in the business school.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Charlie?  </p><p> MUNGER:  I said I thought the business schools were improving, which I  think is true, including in the investment field, but they have a lot of  room for it.  </p><p> CLAMAN: The Buffett rule, that's getting so much attention.  Charlie, what  did you think when Warren pushed for the Buffett rule and has been quite  vocal about it?  </p><p> MUNGER:  Well, it's caused me some lack of popularity at my country club,  and I'm willing to bear it in order to participate in Berkshire.  I think  it's fine if the rich people pay more taxes.  </p><p> CLAMAN:  Warren, you know -- </p><p> BUFFETT:  I think it's fine if he pays more taxes too. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CLAMAN:  Do you see the other side of it that, oh, the wealthy are the ones  who are paying the biggest amount of taxes and that a large percentage of  people don't pay any taxes aside from sales taxes, etcetera?  That whole  argument. </p><p> BUFFETT: Well the etcetera is payroll taxes. </p><p> CLAMAN: Yes. </p><p> BUFFETT: Payroll taxes are $800 billion of a $2.3 trillion dono -- revenue  thing.  So payroll taxes are a huge element of our revenue base.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Charlie?</p><p>  MUNGER:  Well, I don't like the idea that nobody but the rich should  pay taxes, because the country can't work on taxes from the rich people.   It won't produce enough.  And it would have terrible economic effects.</p><p>  So I don't like this politics of envy style of -- of discourse.</p><p>  But I think the rich people should cheerfully pay more taxes.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  We already talked to Warren about the developments in Europe  this morning, with France turning socialist with Francois Hollande, who's  the Socialist president.  The U.S. banks, Warren, you said were in a far,  far better position.  But both you and Charlie sat here a year ago on Fox  Business and really were quite concerned about what would happen with  Europe.</p><p>  Can the European banks -- or at least some of them -- are they so weak  that they can somehow systematically negatively affect U.S. banks or our  banking system here, Charlie?</p><p>  MUNGER:  I don't think it will have that much effect on us.  But I do  think they still have a terrible problem.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Warren?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes, I agree with that.  But, obviously, it would have some  effect, but as I say, I do not think our fate is in the hands of European  banks.  And I'd worry very much if I were.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Well, they're all very cheap.</p><p>  Are -- are you -- would you (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>  BUFFET:  They're not -- they're not necessarily cheap.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  So you're not considering buying any?</p><p>  BUFFET:  I -- I -- there's not a European bank that I'm looking at.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Not a European bank you're looking at.  Internationally, by  virtue of the fact that you're huge in insurance in this -- in this  company, we cannot ignore the risk that is lurking out of Iran and its  plans for nuclear dependence and -- and perhaps eventually dominance.</p><p>  Are you writing -- are any of your insurance companies writing any  policies related to that risk of Iran?</p><p>  BUFFET:  We exclude nuclear (INAUDIBLE).  But that's been true  generally for a long time.  We exclude.  And the nuclear risk is one that  all the resources of the insurance industry can't handle.  So it would be  folly to write it, because people wouldn't get the protection they thought  they were getting.</p><p>  So nuclear is out of the question.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Charlie, are you concerned about what is happening in Iran  and -- and do you see an eventual military tension between U.S.-Iran or --  or Iran and Israel, which would eventually, perhaps, draw in the United  States?</p><p>  MUNGER:  Well, I don't think I know much about how it's going to work.   And I am deeply suspicious of other people who claim to know what's going  to happen exactly.</p><p>  I think the future is often very hard to know.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Trans -- we already talked about TransCanada.</p><p>  Let's -- let's just quickly move on to your -- your lifestyle.</p><p>  What newspapers or Web sites do you guys read every morning?</p><p>  We have a lot of viewers who asked about this.</p><p>  Bill, every morning, what do you reach for?</p><p>  GATES:  Well, I read \"New York Times,\" \"Wall Street Journal.\" \"The  Economist\" is sort of my regular weekly fare.</p><p>  BUFFET:  He -- he can give you last week's by memory.  He -- he knows  every word.</p><p>  GATES:  No, it's great, it's great to have something you read on a  regular basis.  And they do special sections.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Charlie, what do you read?</p><p>  MUNGER:  Well, I agree with Bill.  I think the best one publication I  read is \"The Economist.\"..</p><p>  CLAMAN:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>  MUNGER:  -- which is interesting.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes, well, I read that, but I -- I -- I read the local paper.   I read the \"FT.\" I read \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I read \"The New York  Times\" and I -- and I read \"USA Today.\"</p><p>  CLAMAN:  What do you watch on TV?</p><p>  People wanted to know that, aside from sports, because I know you're a  big sports fan.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Yes, well, I watch sports and I watch the Sunday news shows  and -- and...</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Is there one you prefer?</p><p>  BUFFET:  No, I...</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Do you try to (INAUDIBLE) all...</p><p>  BUFFET:  I watch them all.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  You watch them all?</p><p>  BUFFET:  I watch them all.  And I -- I have them taped and  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Oh, so you are technical?</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  BUFFET:  No, my wife does it.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  BUFFET:  And -- oh, what else do I watch here?</p><p>  CLAMAN:  I mean is there a show you think out there is clever?</p><p>  GATES:  Well, Comedy Ctrl is clever.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Oh, of course.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Yes.</p><p>  GATES:  It's certainly, in a political season, there's a lot to make  fun of.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Speaking of which, one of our viewers, one of our, actually,  our viewer Twitterers had asked, \"Who do you think might be a good vice  presidential candidate for Mitt Romney?\"</p><p>  Charlie?</p><p>  MUNGER:  I haven't the faintest idea.  I have some people I don't  think should qualify.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Who?</p><p>  MUNGER:  Oh, I'm not going to say.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  BUFFET:  I was hoping you'd ask him.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  MUNGER:  It would be a long list.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Warren, what do you think?</p><p>  BUFFET:  I think he shouldn't -- I think he would -- I think, largely,  he will.  I think he should pick somebody who he thinks would be best  qualified to serve as president of the United States if anything happened  to him.  And -- and though people don't vote for the vice presidential  candidate very -- to any great degree, so he can afford himself the luxury  of doing that.  And I think that he probably is the kind of person that  will.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Here's another Twitter person who wanted to know, \"What is  the most significant motivator in your working life and how has that  changed through the years?\"</p><p>  Bill?</p><p>  GATES:  Well, I've kind of shifted from the innovations at Microsoft,  which are great digital empowerment things, to helping the poorest.  And so  figures like how many less children died this year than last year, you  know, pretty exciting to see that we're getting that number down.</p><p>  You know, there's still a lot of science (ph), but it's -- it's aimed  at the poorest now.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Warren, your biggest motivator?</p><p>  BUFFET:  Oh, I -- just -- just running Berkshire is -- it's -- it's  fun every day.  And it's a never finished painting.  And it's always got  enough twists and turns in it to make it interesting.</p><p>  So I know -- I know I'll have -- you know, I could -- I could be my  age and retire and I could spend all week planning my haircut, you know.   And this is a lot more fun.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  CLAMAN:  I want to thank all of you, Bill Gates, Charlie Munger and  Warren Buffet...</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Thank you .</p><p>  CLAMAN:  -- for joining us exclusively together.  It's always  fascinating to hear your perspectives on so many things.</p><p>  Thank you for being on Fox Business.</p><p>  BUFFET:  Thank you.</p><p>  CLAMAN:  Stuart, back to you in New York.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2012 CNBC/Dow Jones Business  Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.

And as we look at how it's trading, it is up slightly, about .5 percent.</p><p>What do you think of that trade?</p><p>Do you think it would have been higher, lower?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, that doesn't change my conclusion, because of some half a percent. And, you know, I don't -- I have no idea whether Berkshire's stock will go up or down in the next week or month or year.</p><p>But in relation to the businesses we own, it -- it's attractive.</p><p>CLAMAN: One of the number one questions that came out this weekend -- it was interesting to me, because I've been coming six years and I have never heard so many people ask why isn't Berkshire paying a dividend. This at a time when the largest percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies are now paying dividends. It's the first time in a long time that they are.</p><p>And then you have the fact that you own dividend paying stocks like Coca-Cola, American Express, Intel, which just raised its dividend this morning, by the way.</p><p>Why won't you pay a dividend to your shareholders?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, we think our shareholders, five years from now, will be wealthier, counting what they would get from the reinvestment of the dividend. We think they would be -- they'll be wealthier if we hold onto the money.</p><p>Now, we may be wrong in that, but historically we've been right. And if -- if we had paid a dividend over the years our shareholders would be considerably poorer than they -- 10 years ago. And as long as we -- I think we will have the opportunity to invest dollars, to create more than a dollar of present value, we'll retain the money. And when we don't think we can do that we'll either repurchase stock or pay dividends.</p><p>CLAMAN: Is there no way you will ever pay a dividend?</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, some day Berkshire will pay a dividend because it will get so large that it can't use the money, or all of the money that it earns, effectively.</p><p>But -- but we don't think we're at that point, although we're much closer to that point, obviously, than we were 20 years ago.</p><p>CLAMAN: I just mentioned that Coke pays a dividend. Speaking of Coke, the board is mulling a stock split.</p><p>Would you be for a stock split of Coca-Cola?</p><p>BUFFET: I'm -- I'm totally neutral on that. It's -- it's fine with me if they do and it's fine with me if they don't.</p><p>But it -- it won't make any difference to us in terms of the value of our Coca-Cola stock.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. The succession plan was a very major focus here. And you said you'd be very clear about it. You do finally have one person in mind, with two back-ups. I got you to tell us yesterday that it was a he.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: But it is a male?</p><p>BUFFET: It's a male.</p><p>CLAMAN: It is a male. OK. I talked to some shareholders who said it is becoming increasingly evident to them that it's Ajit Jain, who runs your insurance business. Keep going with the poker-faced one, because they say the insurance business is increasingly becoming the -- one of the major important factors, the most important factors for the future of Berkshire and the profits that it brings in.</p><p>BUFFET: Look, I would say this about the insurance business. It's been enormously important in getting us to where we are now. It's still enormously important. It's actually not as important relative to the entirety of Berkshire as it was 10 years ago. We've added more businesses away from insurance.</p><p>But insurance has driven us to where we are presently.</p><p>CLAMAN: And the culture, you said he understands the culture of Berkshire.</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, all three of the candidates understand the culture very well.</p><p>CLAMAN: All right. All three, but Ajit at the top?</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, I --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: When -- when we put you on the board, you'll know.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. All right. Only the board knows.</p><p>You also said about your successor that under your new successor, there will not be much of a derivatives book under Berkshire's umbrella.</p><p>Is that because you feel you really understand derivatives in a way that nobody else does or that they've become dangerous for Berkshire?</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, it -- it -- there isn't that much of a derivatives book right now, if you look at the total value of Berkshire. We've done very little in new revenues. But we have a few and one particularly good sized position in terms of our equity put situation. Only that's nothing compared to what we have in equities overall.</p><p>So it's not a big deal now. I would guess it would be a lesser deal. And -- and partly that's because the rule -- in fact, in a big way that's because the rules have been charged on derivatives. We would not have the derivatives position we have now if the rules had been the same five or 10 years ago in relation to posting of collateral. We think that -- that derivatives become much more dangerous for the individual enterprise when they're required to post collateral.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. You're 81 years old. That's not any news to anybody. But the fact that you were diagnosed with Stage 1 prostate cancer gave some people a start. It is obviously non-aggressive. And you say it's a non- issue. And you won't miss a single day of work due to your treatment, which starts in, what, July?</p><p>BUFFET: Mid-July.</p><p>CLAMAN: Mid-July?</p><p>BUFFET: Yes. Um-hmm.</p><p>CLAMAN: You won't miss any work at all?</p><p>BUFFET: No. No. No. Maybe -- maybe 15 minutes a day, something like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: We can lose you for 15 minutes.</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I wish -- I wish that we couldn't, but the truth is you can't.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: But when you look at the -- the person who will eventually take over, have you begun to apprentice your successor?</p><p>BUFFET: My -- my successor doesn't need apprenticing. If they needed apprenticing, they wouldn't be the successor (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>CLAMAN: They wouldn't be the one?</p><p>BUFFET: No. In fact, none of the three candidates would need apprenticing.</p><p>CLAMAN: In some of what you talked about, you talked about how great some businesses are, but you talked about a big mistake. Energy future --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CLAMAN: -- from a Texas utility company.</p><p>BUFFET: All mine do.</p><p>CLAMAN: So sorry to bring it up.</p><p>BUFFET: I did it by myself.</p><p>CLAMAN: But these were tied very tightly to the price of natural gas.</p><p>BUFFET: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: Which plummeted shortly after you bought it.</p><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: How'd you get that so wrong?</p><p>BUFFET: It was easy. I'll probably be able to do it again.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: The -- it was -- it was -- it was just a case of not -- not cranking that into my decision, weighting it with the appropriate probability.</p><p>CLAMAN: But 2010, you had to do a $2 billion write up -- write-down; 2011, another $398 million write-down.</p><p>How much --</p><p>BUFFET: (INAUDIBLE) that total. But the total -- the total we put in was about $2 billion and -- and I think it's been written out of maybe $400 million or $500 million.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, how much was it going to get?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, it can go all the way to zero.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you think it will?</p><p>BUFFET: It -- it easily could.</p><p>CLAMAN: Who -- who sold you on this idea, gold (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>BUFFET: Me. Me.</p><p>CLAMAN: Really?</p><p>BUFFET: No, no, no.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CLAMAN: Goldman Sachs?</p><p>BUFFET: No, I -- I have -- I have a real ability to pick these -- pick these out.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>One of the things you said that people sat on the edge of their seat, because they want to know what you're buying, more newspapers.</p><p>BUFFET: It's possible.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jimmy Kimmel told a joke at the Washington correspondents dinner. He said, what's black, white and red all over?</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, so I heard.</p><p>CLAMAN: Nothing.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yet you're buying now?</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: And you said specifically local newspapers.</p><p>How about \"The New York Times?\"</p><p>Is that local enough?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I -- if a -- I would have to say, if I could buy \"The New York Times,\" I might buy it personally. I -- I don't know whether I'd buy it for Berkshire. But it's not for sale.</p><p>It's -- that's a very special case.</p><p>The newspapers that exist in communities where there's a strong sense of community and where the newspapers respond to that strong sense of community by -- by telling people a whole lot of things that they want to know about their own community that they can't find some place else, those newspapers will do OK. They'll still be in decline over time.</p><p>CLAMAN: But is it that you see that their value is relatively -- that their price is relatively cheap to earnings?</p><p>BUFFET: In some cases.</p><p>CLAMAN: Um-hmm.</p><p>BUFFET: In some cases. But the earnings are not going to -- the earnings are not going to go up. I mean you're looking -- and -- and they're probably going to go down in most -- in practically all cases.</p><p>So you have to buy them at a value, actually, that takes that into account.</p><p>CLAMAN: \"The Washington Post,\" you stepped down from the board.</p><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: But you still fully own your position?</p><p>BUFFET: We own every share we've ever owned.</p><p>CLAMAN: Even though it's off its 52 week highs.</p><p>Do you feel it's doing pretty well?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, it -- I don't know whether they've published their first quarter earnings yet or not. But -- but they have problems in two of their businesses, one in the education business and one in the newspaper. And -- and that's been reflected, I think, in the price.</p><p>But those two businesses are -- well, the newspaper is far tougher than it was five or 10 years ago. And the education business is tougher than it was about two years ago.</p><p>CLAMAN: What's interesting to people, though, when you say that you would buy more newspapers is at a time when everybody else is getting out, it seems like you and Rupert Murdoch are the only people getting into newspapers.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, right. And he may not be quite as competitive for a while, either. So, no. But they are not a -- it's not an industry whose earnings are going to -- the earnings are going to just shrink in the newspaper business, as are the revenues. But not -- I don't necessarily think they'll shrink at a dramatic rate where you have a strong feeling of community and you have a newspaper that serves that community well.</p><p>CLAMAN: \"The Washington Post\" reported Friday and their revenue --</p><p>BUFFET: Did they?</p><p>OK.</p><p>CLAMAN: -- fell.</p><p>Yes, their revenue fell. Well, speaking of Rupert Murdoch, because I brought it up, hoc, is the head of News Corp, the parent of Fox Business.</p><p>BUFFET: Sure.</p><p>CLAMAN: You -- you made a little quip about our sister network, Fox. One shareholder questioned whether your personal politics --</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: -- hurt shares of the company. And your response was, \"I really think someone making an investment decision based on the politics of whether he agrees or not with the CEO, sounds to me like he ought to own Fox.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: I'll leave it at that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: What -- what do you mean by that?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I mean, I think it's silly to make a decision --</p><p>CLAMAN: Right.</p><p>BUFFET: -- based on the politics of the CEO. I -- I can't tell you the politics of the CEOs of our major investments. There may be one or two that I would know about, but it is absolutely a zero factor in our making a decision on a business.</p><p>CLAMAN: I guess maybe people were really meaning that they're in contradiction, they feel differently about the Buffett Rule than you do.</p><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: You clarified in September to Fox Business News that what you meant was the uber rich should pay a commensurate tax rate of about 30 percent, that a let -- a lot of the rest of Americans are paying.</p><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yet the Buffet -- yet the Obama administration kind of took it in a different way and is now promoting it for people who make a million dollars or more.</p><p>Have you talked to the president about how he's split from what you really intended?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, that isn't really different than what I intended. I mean, I might tweak it a little bit in one direction or another. But I was talking about the people making a million or more.</p><p>Now I would probably have a different break, also, for the people making $10 million or more.</p><p>But the -- Senator Whitehouse is the one that put the bill in. And I wrote him a letter immediately after he did so that in -- I -- I basically approve of his bill. If I were writing the bill, I'd write it a little -- slightly different, but so would everybody else.</p><p>But I -- I think it -- it gets at the -- it gets at the point that 131 out of 400 of the highest incomes in the country, those 400 incomes average $270 million each. That's not bad. That's, you know, almost three quarters of a million dollars a day. And --</p><p>CLAMAN: We'd take it.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes. And a -- a third of those people paid less than a 15 percent rate, combined payroll and income tax.</p><p>And I -- I think -- I think that's wrong and I think it -- and in an economy where we're going to ask for shared sacrifice of people, that we ought to go after the (INAUDIBLE). It doesn't solve the revenue problem.</p><p>But I think that people want a code that has at least that much fairness in it.</p><p>CLAMAN: But, Warren, if you feel so strongly about that, why not take a bigger salary than you always have?</p><p>You've always opted to take your income in cash -- in -- in Berkshire stock versus cash.</p><p>Yet if you took a bigger salary instead, you could pay that 30 percent rate.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Why not have done it that way?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, the company would get a deduction, too. So the government would be -- would be worse off rather than wise (ph), actually, because the company would get a 35 percent deduction if they paid it to me.</p><p>So it's -- it -- it wouldn't change the revenue, it would just take some money from the shareholders.</p><p>CLAMAN: Here's what -- what I heard from some other people, too, is they said, you know, when you're donating most of your -- your money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is philanthropic and wonderful and yet that will keep it from being taxed.</p><p>And some would say, why not then let it be taxed, because it -- wouldn't it be helpful to give it as revenue to the government?</p><p>BUFFET: That would be an alternative. But I -- I think that we will probably be able to accomplish a lot more around the world with that money going to the foundation.</p><p>But it -- it's a wonderful tax dodge. I urge all you -- all the viewers if they -- if they want to pay less tax, they should give away more money.</p><p>CLAMAN: Investments -- what other countries are you investing in?</p><p>You mentioned an acquisition in the Netherlands.</p><p>But what other countries' companies are starting to look good to you?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, we don't really look by country. That -- that company in the Netherlands was for sale. I mean the owners of it decided to sell it a month or so ago and -- and we ended up buying it last week.</p><p>CLAMAN: Right.</p><p>BUFFET: But we don't look much by country. It -- we -- we really look for businesses we understand, with some kind of competitive advantage and good management and a price that makes sense.</p><p>And if we find that -- we found, you know, the most wonderful of all in Israel six or seven years ago. And we've -- we can find them here in the United States, usually.</p><p>CLAMAN: And that was ISCAR?</p><p>BUFFET: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: You said that there was a $22 billion deal that you missed by that much. You couldn't get that deal done. You wouldn't say what sector it was in.</p><p>Can you say what country it was in?</p><p>BUFFET: No, it was -- but it was on this planet.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: I tried.</p><p>BUFFET: Well, you narrowed it down.</p><p>CLAMAN: How does Brazil look for investment right now?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I -- I --</p><p>CLAMAN: See anything you like in Brazil?</p><p>BUFFET: I --</p><p>CLAMAN: How about that?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I don't know that much about specific -- (INAUDIBLE). I mean, if we found something that was interesting in Brazil, some business I understood, it was large, the price was right. The management was right, we'd buy it in a second.</p><p>CLAMAN: You have bought some European stocks recently.</p><p>BUFFET: That is true.</p><p>CLAMAN: Which ones?</p><p>I mean it's going to come out in an SEC filing eventually, won't it?</p><p>BUFFET: No, actually, we don't have to report the foreign stocks.</p><p>CLAMAN: You don't have to report it?</p><p>BUFFET: No.</p><p>CLAMAN: So you won't say?</p><p>BUFFET: No, that's true.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. But would you say, 10, 11, 12 coun -- companies?</p><p>BUFFET: It was about -- I think it was more like nine.</p><p>CLAMAN: Nine?</p><p>BUFFET: Um-hmm.</p><p>CLAMAN: This morning, folks, when <person><nameText>Warren Buffet </nameText></person>arrived here at our shoot, he quickly went upstairs to put in stock orders.</p><p>European stock orders?</p><p>BUFFET: Not today.</p><p>CLAMAN: Not today.</p><p>So at -- U.S. equities?</p><p>BUFFET: That's what's left, yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: Because I did say it was on this planet, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: U.S. equities look cheap then at this point, with the markets the way they are today?</p><p>BUFFET: Some do.</p><p>CLAMAN: Some do.</p><p>BUFFET: Some do, sure.</p><p>CLAMAN: Let's talk about the news of the weekend, as well. Nicolas Sarkozy is out in France.</p><p>BUFFET: He's out. Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: And Francois Hollande, who is, of course, a Socialist, is in.</p><p>This is disconcerting to a lot of people who wonder, will we see capital flight away from France, the likes of what we saw when Francois Mitterand, who was also a Socialist, was elected years ago.</p><p>Will people take their money out of France?</p><p>Do you predict that or could you see that?</p><p>BUFFET: I -- I don't know the answer to that. I -- I would not be enthused if I had a Socialist win anyplace. But -- but the -- I think the problems facing Europe transcend, almost, you know, those in any specific country. I mean they have to work out the rules under which 17 countries can really work together. When they lock themselves into a monetary unit. And they haven't locked themselves in in a number of other ways.</p><p>So, I think overall what happens in Europe is probably maybe affected by the leaders in given countries, but it's going to be much more important than any specific election.</p><p>CLAMAN: You just said locked into a specific currency. Was the euro idea a mistake?</p><p>BUFFETT: Getting out of it would be an enormous problem, too, but I think maybe it was a mistake. As it was done. In fact, I can say it was a mistake as it was done. Now the question is whether you can modify the original concept in some way that makes this more workable than it is proving to be.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, as it morphs and changes, Greece has parliamentary elections and neo-Nazis were elected to the parliament. Is it just a matter of time before Greece either leaves or gets jettisoned from the euro zone?</p><p>BUFFETT: I don't know about - I think it's a matter of time until they come up with a better solution than the present structure or they abandon it entirely. Who knows which it will happen?</p><p>CLAMAN: Forty-seven years later from you starting your company, you finally invested in a technology stock or two. IBM and Intel --</p><p>BUFFETT: Yes, I didn't - I didn't do the Intel.</p><p>CLAMAN: You didn't do the Intel. You did the IMB.</p><p>BUFFETT: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Who did the Intel?</p><p>BUFFETT: Yes, it would have been Todd because he was the only one -</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. Todd did -- Todd Holmes, who is one of your new investment managers. It was his idea. But you never bought Microsoft. Did you hear from your board member <person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>about that?</p><p>BUFFETT: I can't buy -- I can't buy Microsoft. If we bought Microsoft, for one thing, our buying days take place month after month after month. And if something happened that was favorable at Microsoft, people would have said I had insider information.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, actually, let's bring in <person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>right now, who founded Microsoft -</p><p>BUFFETT: Maybe he'll give me some insider information!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFETT: Now's the time.</p><p>CLAMAN: What's inside information at Microsoft (ph)?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: When you heard that he finally bought a technology stock and IBM and Intel, did you think those were pretty good ideas?</p><p><person><nameText>BILL GATES, </nameText></person>FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: Well, I think it is great that Todd gets the entire universe to exercise his great thinking. And he has done a good job there.</p><p>A lot of technology companies, you can't see where they will be in 10 years or 20 years. IBM has enough service revenue that they may be somewhat of an exception to that. But most tech stocks, you know, play a very high- variance game, which makes it I think the most interesting in the street in the world. But not for an investor who wants any degree of downside protection.</p><p>BUFFETT: He told me that when I met him in 1991, too.</p><p>And what point should be made about Todd. Todd can change his positions far, far easier than I can. So, Todd is working with sums. If he decides to move onto something else, he can - he can do that. I can't do that with the big positions that we take. So, we are really locked in more than he would be.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, you just said that with many tech stocks, you can't see where they will be in ten to 20 years. Can you see, Warren, where Facebook would be in 10 to 20 years?</p><p>BUFFETT: No, no I can't. I mean, it is an enormously impressive accomplishment. And my guess is it has a big future of some sort. But I have no idea. I didn't even know what it was six or seven years ago. And I'm still not on it, so -</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, are you on Facebook?</p><p>GATES: Sure.</p><p>CLAMAN: You are on Twitter as well.</p><p>BUFFETT: He's in a different world.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Always have been. In fact, I remember when you were saying Bill had to teach you how to just simply click on the blue E for Explorer.</p><p>BUFFETT: He's had his problems with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GATES: Well, Warren's a big tech user (ph) if you count online bridge.</p><p>CLAMAN: That's right.</p><p>GATES: That takes him up into the top one percent in terms of Internet addicts.</p><p>BUFFETT: I'm like a guy who's (INAUDIBLE) to turn on the switch. And then, as far as I'm concerned, there's some guy inside that thing that's playing - (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Listen, let's talk about Facebook. It's huge news today. The beginning of the road show.</p><p>Bill, you have been dealing with investors and analysts for years and banks for years and years. Would you tell Mark Zuckerberg -- because there is question as to whether he will attend the road show. Would you say, you know, you really should get out there and do it?</p><p>GATES: I know when Microsoft had to do its road show, I minimized the amount of time. I think I offered three days, I told them no limousines. I took a book about biology. I was reading during the breaks. I tried not to have it take too much time away from the business. You know, so, you've got to focus on what is important in making sure your profit friend (ph) users is great -- as number one</p><p>BUFFETT: This is a guy that negotiated down with his mother (INAUDIBLE) down to an hour over the time he was willing to spend with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GATES: Well, I didn't know what I was in for. I thought --</p><p>CLAMAN: Didn't want to spend more than an hour with Buffett? Your mom said meet the guy, and --</p><p>GATES: Before Warren and I met, I wasn't sure we had that much to talk about. Now, I was 100 percent wrong about that, but my mom made me say I would stay a few hours at this event that Kay, Graham and Warren were at. In fact, I stayed the whole day, and I was disappointed when Warren was leaving because talking about business and the dynamics of how things were changing I found somebody I'm part of -- one of the most interesting parts of my life. A lifelong conversation.</p><p>BUFFETT: His mom was prying us apart at the end.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: What would you advise Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook to attend that road show?</p><p>BUFFETT: I wouldn't worry too much. I mean - you know, that offering was going to be big. I'm not saying the stock is going to go, but it is going to get all the attention in the world. And people know what Facebook is. I mean, it's not a mystery that has to be explained.</p><p>CLAMAN: Can it --</p><p>BUFFETT: Except to me!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: If -- if it does have $100 billion valuation or whatever the crazy numbers are out there, can it sustain that? What does it need to do to sustain that? What does it need to do to sustain that, Bill?</p><p>GATES: Well, it just needs to have advertising revenue that makes that earnings dream properly discounted be greater than $100 billion.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GATES: And -</p><p>CLAMAN: Simple!</p><p>GATES: It's right there in \"The Intelligent Investor\"!</p><p>You know, they have a lot of traffic. And the ability to monetize that traffic over time will be fascinating to see if they can push up and go beyond the earnings stream you need for that or not. But it is one phenomenally impressive company.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, everybody is always talking about the succession plan. And you know, you went through this very issue back when you decided to leave the CEO position at Microsoft. The stock has done really well lately, and Windows 8 is about to blast onto the scene. And I hear from -- Recover Silicon Valley heavily at Fox Business. And I hear from them that once Windows 8 gets into the ultra-books and it becomes a touch screen, you could very well take on the Mac Air and the MacBook.</p><p>Is that what Microsoft should be aiming for, and do you think it could happen with Ultra Books?</p><p>GATES: Well, it is very exciting that Windows 8 is coming out. It's a very big deal for the company. Steve and the whole team are doing a great job there. It creates a new category of machines that are sort of -- have the good things about tablets and the good things about PCs. And so, it's going to evolve these digital tools.</p><p>You know, people right now like the tablet, but it's hard to -</p><p>CLAMAN: Type on.</p><p>GATES: -- to give input. You don't have Microsoft Office on there. And so, with our hardware partners, there's a lot of neat stuff that comes out later year.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, what kind of computer do you use?</p><p>BUFFETT: I think it's an HP that the guys at the furniture market (ph) sent over.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, what do you use, Bill?</p><p>GATES: Well, I have a Samsung tablet is my primary machine, but I have Dell machines and a variety. I'm always getting the latest and greatest.</p><p>CLAMAN: So, no iPad for you.</p><p>GATES: No, no, -- I said I am using the latest and greatest.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFETT: Bill has -- they have a chimpanzee up there in Seattle, and then they have me and then they have us both test these new things.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And, actually, I am more reliable than the chimpanzee.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you have an iPad, Warren?</p><p>BUFFETT: No.</p><p>CLAMAN: No. So, you're not going for the tablet at this point.</p><p>Bill, let's just say the Samsung Galaxy has gone traction, but not nearly as much as the iPad has. Rim couldn't come out with a tablet that smacked it down nor hp.</p><p>What company out there has the special something that can take on that iPad in your opinion?</p><p>GATES: Well, the tablets base is going to grow, but you really want something where you either have a pen or keyboard and you have your productivity applications. So, you want the best of both worlds, and that is what Microsoft and others are pushing for.</p><p>I think this fall, people will understand that there is room for big improvement there.</p><p>CLAMAN: Microsoft just made a pretty big deal, about $300 million with Barnes &amp; Noble. Will eventually that morph into a deal to make some type of tablet or a Kindle with Microsoft abilities to jack it up?</p><p>GATES: Well, the idea is they are going to take their reading experience and books and make them look super good on these new devices. And so, on these devices, you want to run Office where you create documents. But you want to consume books in new ways, consume videos in new ways. And so, it's that merger and having their team do innovative work is what made that investment a smart idea.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, you said this weekend you would not buy Apple.</p><p>BUFFETT: Well, I said I wouldn't know enough to buy Apple. Yes. But no, I'm not going to buy anything I don't feel I can have a reasonable fix on what they will look like in five or ten years. And I certainly didn't have a reasonable fix - I wish I had -- ten years ago on Apple but I don't have one now.</p><p>I think it's an amazing company. But there are lots of businesses I don't understand.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, tech companies have gotten so desperate to have the latest and greatest technology that they are trying to buy in in patents. They're trying to buy chunks of patents, you know, with the Motorola mobility issue. Today, a judge is going to consider, I believe, that Microsoft's complaint that Motorola is charging for what really should be basic technology patents.</p><p>Have the patent wars gotten a little out of hand?</p><p>GATES: No, I think the idea that invention is valuable has become more obvious. It was always true in the drug industry that the whole industry, these miracle medicine exists, because patents were protecting that invention.</p><p>And fortunately, we are seeing more invention in many areas. The IT sector has got a lot, but you know, if you come up with a renewable energy design, that is going to be protected by a patent.</p><p>So, patents are important. There are immensely complex, and sometimes when people look at it either because of the complexity of the system because they haven't looked into it, it seems strange to them. But the idea that invention has value - I think that is an idea that is more and more important over time.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren?</p><p>BUFFETT: Oh, I agree. I just don't know how to invent anything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: There have been a couple of corporate scandals. Among them, Apple and Foxconn. Foxconn is one of the manufacturers of components of Apple's products. They were accused of mistreating their workers and in some cases underpaying them.</p><p>Did Apple handle that right? Would you care if you found out that one of your companies under the Berkshire umbrella was buying a lot of stuff from people who mistreated their workers?</p><p>BUFFETT: Sure, and we hope that all our companies are looking at all kinds of things including that. But f you have a very, very large company something is going to go wrong. And right now I can tell you with 270,000 employees at Berkshire, someone is doing something they shouldn't. I just hope it is small, I hope we find out about it, and then I hope whoever is in charge does something about it properly but you cannot run a large army or a large government bureau or large church without things going wrong from time to time. It's going to happen.</p><p>CLAMAN: It is going to happen but this Foxconn issue was out there. Wired Magazine a year and a half ago had a huge front-page story about it, Bill. I'm just wondering -- had that ever happened to you at Microsoft? Would you look at that and say Apple really should have dealt with that much more quickly?</p><p>GATES: I think American companies overall are improving labor conditions when they're involved in whether it is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or really looking down the supply chain at trying to make sure labor conditions are okay, I think American business has had a positive effect. I don't know specifics of the Apple case but I know they are not going to try to take shortcuts in that way. They are certainly very focused on fixing any problems at this point.</p><p>CLAMAN: You mentioned the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That's pretty controversial with Wal-Mart lately and a lot of people saying hey, that is how you get business done in Mexico. What is your response to that?</p><p>BUFFETT: My responses is that we have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It may very well be that's the way business is done in Mexico but you'd better not do it if you are an American corporation.</p><p>CLAMAN: Maybe the crime was less important than the cover-up.</p><p>BUFFETT: It's always a problem. I mean, I know something's being done that's wrong at Berkshire, I can't tell what it is and --</p><p>CLAMAN: But Warren, if somebody came to you and you knew about it, like the Wal-Mart top executives did, would you say \"don't be so aggressive on that?\"</p><p>BUFFETT: No, but I think almost all CEOs when they know the facts - - it certainly seems quite clear there was bribery in all of that. Exactly what happened after that, I'm not sure about, but I would think there are very few American CEOs that if they find out about some problems, they're going to try to figure out something to do and something about them promptly.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, earlier we were talking with Warren about how he wants to buy more newspapers.</p><p>GATES: He's not going to compete with me.</p><p>CLAMAN: You are not going to buy newspapers? Because he got the idea to buy railroads back in 2006 from you. You were already in a Canadian railroad.</p><p>GATES: No, Warren's has been playing with railroads since he was a boy.</p><p>BUFFETT: That's right.</p><p>GATES: I can hardly take credit for introducing him to that whole sector of the economy.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm repeating what he told me.</p><p>GATES: He's very generous. We both made good money. We're happy railroad investors.</p><p>CLAMAN: You both -- and I knew this about Warren, but I didn't know you used to be a newspaper delivery boy.</p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely. I was far better than Warren. It's really one of those things that needs more coverage.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>BUFFETT: I was there yesterday, he didn't show up.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>CLAMAN: We got video of it. There was a newspaper throwing contest where we all tossed Omaha World Heralds to the porch of a Clayton home.</p><p>GATES: Exactly.</p><p>CLAMAN: I was stunned to see, here's Warren, you made it right to the porch, and then Bill exactly in the same position, that little boy is one of your grandsons.</p><p>GATES: He won that.</p><p>BUFFETT: I own the house and the newspaper, I better be close enough.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>GATES: When it came to ping-pong, I would say I was a little better. We're 1 to 1 for the weekend.</p><p>BUFFETT: That's right.</p><p>[CROSSTALK]</p><p>CLAMAN: 2 on 1. Then you brought up the gigantic paddle.</p><p>BUFFETT: That didn't work either. [laughter]</p><p>CLAMAN: In the past you've done a lot of things. You've danced with the Nebraska cheerleaders. You've ridden a bull. That must have been incredible. Back then when you were doing it, you were in your 70s. They are both looking at the monitor.</p><p>BUFFETT: Absolutely. I look as bad as I look there as I do here.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, your vice chairman, never participates in sitting on the bull or throwing the newspapers, why not?</p><p>BUFFETT: He's the thinker in the group.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>CLAMAN: In fact here he is, Charlie Munger, the vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway, joining us now. Good morning Charlie. Welcome to the party here.</p><p>CHARLIE MUNGER, VICE CHAIR, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlies, there was so much focus this weekend on Warren's health and his succession plan and how much longer Warren will be running the company. Let's turn it to you, how much longer will you be up on stage with Warren for these annual shareholder meetings?</p><p>MUNGER: I serve a very important function because people look at me and think they will get another seven years out of Warren. I don't think he's anxious to get rid of me.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>BUFFETT: I'm there to show there's some guy older than me in American business. Makes me look very good when I'm up there.</p><p>CLAMAN: How much longer will you participate? Somebody said is this Charlie's last year?</p><p>MUNGER: No.</p><p>BUFFETT: Well, I hope not.</p><p>CLAMAN: You have every plan to remain on the stage at these meetings?</p><p>MUNGER: I'm not going to sit up there drooling. But I plan to be there. If the only way to get up is to drool, then I'll drool.</p><p>CLAMAN: You were as feisty as ever. One comment you made got a round of applause from the audience that was on the mortgage and lending bubble. And you said this -- this is stuff you have said over the past couple of years, but you've never phrased it like this before, you said it was wrong not to stamp down on felony and folly of all that irresponsible lending, quote I often say \"Alan Greenspan overdosed on Ayn Rand.\" Meaning the whole free market hands-off approach was a total disaster?</p><p>MUNGER: Certainly. Most of these have limits. In other words, an ax murderer is not a good thing because it happens in a free market. There's a limit to when the free market is -- [inaudible] a free market with that kind of fraud and folly it is not wise to allow it. We were disgraceful to sit there and let Canada be sensible while we went crazy.</p><p>BUFFETT: I would say this in, in fairness to Alan Greenspan and Charlie has made this point that he has said that he's sort of overestimated -- overestimated the ability of the free market to natural operations to rein in -- all the self-interest that --</p><p>MUNGER: Yes, Alan Greenspan is the only person who has apologized.</p><p>CLAMAN: Who else should apologize?</p><p>MUNGER: There's a big list, practically everybody.</p><p>CLAMAN: Banks, U.S. banks?</p><p>MUNGER: Oh, my God, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Dodd Frank, now we have that, but the last numbers I looked at, it is 850 pages long. The Volcker Rule alone breaks down to 380 plus questions and those have more than 1400 sub-questions. Will that be the thing that prevents us from dealing with this type of disaster again?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, it was certainly a step in the right direction. If I had the power, I would have made the Volcker act look like a non-restraint. I would have done much more.</p><p>CLAMAN: So you think that preventing banks from investing in the proprietary trading issue? They are all complaining, Charlie, that that's ruining their ability to do well and do well for shareholders.</p><p>MUNGER: Well, that's natural when people were making a lot of money out of something to not want to be forced out of it. These banks ought to only be open on Christmas. They ought to have a fairly restricted repertoire.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, we the taxpayers bailed out a lot of them, including AIG. In the news today is the Treasury Department will try and sell off more taxpayer holdings of AIG. Do you think the bailout of AIG was something we had to do?</p><p>MUNGER: Probably.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you think the taxpayer, Warren, will see a profit on that?</p><p>BUFFETT: Yes, the way it is going, they will show a profit, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, do you think so?</p><p>MUNGER: Barely.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>BUFFETT: He hated to say that.</p><p>CLAMAN: There's belief, trying to jump-start the economy, that if you get rid of onerous regulation -- not all regulation, but onerous regulation -- that businesses will invest more and grow more. You guys own businesses, Lubrizol which is heavily regulated I'm sure, Burlington Northern the railroad heavily regulated. The regulations -- if the regulations were diluted just a bit, would you invest more, that would mean more hiring and the economy would come back?</p><p>MUNGER: The answer is no. Sure there are regulations that don't make any sense out there and there always will be. It is a very big complicated economy, but we are dying to make investments and we invested more money last year than we ever have in the history of Berkshire and we'll break that record again this year. American corporations have lots and lots and lots of liquidity, and where they see demand, they're going to invest in facilities that meet that demand.</p><p>CLAMAN: No matter what?</p><p>MUNGER: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, in your high-tech field, what regulation do you think -- he just talked about regulations that should be banished but what regulation holds you back that you really feel shouldn't be there?</p><p>GATES: I think the closest thing to that is whether or not an engineer who is trained in the United States but is a foreign citizen, it should be easy for them and they should be allowed to be a taxpayer here or they should be forced to go back and the jobs around them created in another country. So the high-tech, high-skills immigration issue is one that definitely affects the job picture.</p><p>CLAMAN: Senator John Kerry has the Startup Visa Act which would if there's a foreigner give them a green card if they have enough investment, they start a business, and they would hire some people, is that something, Charlie, you think is a good idea?</p><p>MUNGER: Yes, but I think Bill's idea is a much bigger idea. I think we're out of our minds to send brilliant people back when they want to stay here.</p><p>BUFFETT: I feel stronger about that than I used to. I mean it is crazy.</p><p>MUNGER: -- could be stronger.</p><p>BUFFETT: It just makes no sense. Bill gave you the best answer you could have on it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Why then do we have it, we make it so difficult with the H1B visa, which is the issue, would you say if you had the opportunity, Bill, to have the president's ear on that issue, surely he knows?</p><p>GATES: There are various things that have not gotten through the Congress, you know, people want to make sure you're doing your best to hire American workers, and so there's a legitimate concern there. But there's a way to be more liberal on this without at all substituting for domestic labor -- labor that you might have used.</p><p>CLAMAN: You have a lot of people that are worried about -- they marry the issue of the border with Mexico with brilliant engineers who are coming from India and China. Is there a way to separate that? Would it be a better idea, Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: Of course it would be a better idea, of course it should be done. This is a competitive world, you do not want to send the brains back.</p><p>BUFFETT: What bill is talking about would increase employment in the United States.</p><p>CLAMAN: Brains. You bought some brains in China, Charlie. BYD, the electric car company, it is fun to see you two disagree on stage. You disagreed about the VAT tax. Charlie thinks we should have a VAT tax. Later, Warren, you told me you didn't think that was a good idea.</p><p>BUFFETT: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Going to electric vehicles, you feel, Charlie, that we should be giving government incentives and real carrots to inspire people to drive more electric vehicles; correct?</p><p>MUNGER: We already do. I have a niece and her husband who commute in Washington, D.C. and because they ride in a Prius, they get to use the fast lane. That's a huge incentive.</p><p>CLAMAN: There's an incentive.</p><p>MUNGER: There is a lot of incentive and there should be.</p><p>CLAMAN: Should it be, Warren, at the expense because the money has to come from somewhere, at big oil, which is well-established and is getting a lot of tax breaks?</p><p>BUFFETT: Charlie is the expert on this subject.</p><p>CLAMAN: Should we sort of lessen what we have given to the oil companies over the years and switch it over to electric vehicles?</p><p>MUNGER: I don't think the big problem of America is the oil companies have been favored too much.</p><p>CLAMAN: You don't think that's a problem?</p><p>MUNGER: Yes, by and large. Exxon is a technical meritocracy which is a very creditable place. In other words, if more of America ran like Exxon, it would be a better country.</p><p>CLAMAN: Let's get to Keystone, then. The Keystone pipeline was rejected initially. Now the new proposal from Transcanada is going. You are both Nebraska residents -- you live in California now, Charlie, but you're from Nebraska. You are also business people. The new route and when we get more details we will know but would you be for the Keystone pipeline if it doesn't threaten the aquifer and it doesn't threaten the areas that are culturally sensitive and environmentally sensitive?</p><p>BUFFETT: I'm not an expert, but it generally sounds like it makes a lot of sense to me. Awful lot of pipelines running through the United States. Net, they have certainly been a huge plus for the country. I don't know all the details on it, but based on what I know, I would say that it makes sense.</p><p>CLAMAN: Were you then disappointed when Keystone was rejected, it could mean so many jobs?</p><p>BUFFETT: I don't think that issue is done with yet. The jobs aspect of it is not the big aspect. The real question is what it will do for the country over many years and what the drawbacks are. But you can build anything that will create jobs. That doesn't mean it is a good idea.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, you are invested in alternative energy and some of it a certain subsector of nuclear, but looking at natural gas, wow, it is so unbelievably inexpensive now and cleaner than oil, do you think this country should be converting to nat gas burning cars and trucks?</p><p>GATES: Well, natural gas, unfortunately, the energy density unless you take it to a very low temperature is much lower, so there's a lot of innovators looking at how can we do that better. There are ways of converting natural gas to liquids, but those factories are very expensive so people are going to try to innovate. There's such good news that we have inexpensive natural gas. It is the most natural that we get the benefit of that in the power generation sector as we're turning over our power plants, but because the price is so attractive on an equivalent energy basis there will be innovations that move it into parts of the transport sector, that's very exciting.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, you said on stage this weekend we should not look for energy independence, we should use up the bad guys' energy --</p><p>MUNGER: Or the good guys, like Canada.</p><p>CLAMAN: Or the good guys but conserve our own.</p><p>MUNGER: Right. That to me is an obvious conclusion considering how precious this stuff is going to get. Trying to use our whole supply, our reserves as fast as possible is insane.</p><p>CLAMAN: But you could arguably stick it to certain Arab nations who despise the United States and they despise Israel and make life difficult for everybody by completely turning off the spigot and not use their oil and then you hit them financially, no?</p><p>MUNGER: My desire to do spiteful things to the Arab nations is zero. As long as they want to sell their oil, I'm delighted to see us buy it rather than use our own. I think that adults suffer now to be better off later. When you save your own oil, and buy the other fellows', that's what you're doing.</p><p>CLAMAN: You drove an electric car, you said the most recent BYD, do you own an electric car?</p><p>MUNGER: No.</p><p>CLAMAN: What do you drive, Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: A Mercedes.</p><p>CLAMAN: What do you drive, Warren?</p><p>BUFFETT: Cadillac.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, what car do you usually use?</p><p>GATES: I have a Mercedes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Two Mercedes. Mercedes is buying advertising right now on Fox Business, so thank you very much, we hope.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>CLAMAN: You both took swipes at business school this weekend which I thought was interesting. You don't think they are teaching the right things. Warren, you went to business school.</p><p>BUFFETT: Apparently.</p><p>CLAMAN: Columbia.</p><p>BUFFETT: And I had a fabulous teacher. I went there because -- two fabulous teachers. And I went there because two people that I really wanted to sit at their feet and I got a chance to do that.</p><p>CLAMAN: And you're generous to business schools. You host more than 40 of them every year --</p><p>BUFFETT: 48.</p><p>CLAMAN: 48, let them come here and take questions. That's certainly wonderful. What is it that business schools are doing wrong?</p><p>BUFFETT: Well, in the investment field I thought that over the last 40 or so years that most -- a great many business schools were teaching nonsense. But that doesn't mean they were in other aspects of other majors within the business schools.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, Charlie, would either of you make a decision to hire somebody based on whether the candidate had gone to business school? Bill?</p><p>GATES: Well, if they are a young person, that's a recent part of their resume, so it might give them some valuable skills. I don't think anybody is saying that business school doesn't have some merit to it. It's just the -- how you do investment valuation as they have tried to apply mathematical techniques, they have claimed more than they should for these techniques.</p><p>BUFFETT: I hired a young woman a couple years ago out of business school, and she would have been very good naturally, but I'm sure she was better because she'd gone to business school, but I didn't hire her for what she learned about investments in the business school.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: I said I thought the business schools were improving, which I think is true, including in the investment field, but they have a lot of room for it.</p><p>CLAMAN: The Buffett rule, that's getting so much attention. Charlie, what did you think when Warren pushed for the Buffett rule and has been quite vocal about it?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, it's caused me some lack of popularity at my country club, and I'm willing to bear it in order to participate in Berkshire. I think it's fine if the rich people pay more taxes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, you know --</p><p>BUFFETT: I think it's fine if he pays more taxes too.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you see the other side of it that, oh, the wealthy are the ones who are paying the biggest amount of taxes and that a large percentage of people don't pay any taxes aside from sales taxes, etcetera? That whole argument.</p><p>BUFFETT: Well the etcetera is payroll taxes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>BUFFETT: Payroll taxes are $800 billion of a $2.3 trillion dono -- revenue thing. So payroll taxes are a huge element of our revenue base.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, I don't like the idea that nobody but the rich should pay taxes, because the country can't work on taxes from the rich people. It won't produce enough. And it would have terrible economic effects.</p><p>So I don't like this politics of envy style of -- of discourse.</p><p>But I think the rich people should cheerfully pay more taxes.</p><p>CLAMAN: We already talked to Warren about the developments in Europe this morning, with France turning socialist with Francois Hollande, who's the Socialist president. The U.S. banks, Warren, you said were in a far, far better position. But both you and Charlie sat here a year ago on Fox Business and really were quite concerned about what would happen with Europe.</p><p>Can the European banks -- or at least some of them -- are they so weak that they can somehow systematically negatively affect U.S. banks or our banking system here, Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: I don't think it will have that much effect on us. But I do think they still have a terrible problem.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren?</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, I agree with that. But, obviously, it would have some effect, but as I say, I do not think our fate is in the hands of European banks. And I'd worry very much if I were.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, they're all very cheap.</p><p>Are -- are you -- would you (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>BUFFET: They're not -- they're not necessarily cheap.</p><p>CLAMAN: So you're not considering buying any?</p><p>BUFFET: I -- I -- there's not a European bank that I'm looking at.</p><p>CLAMAN: Not a European bank you're looking at. Internationally, by virtue of the fact that you're huge in insurance in this -- in this company, we cannot ignore the risk that is lurking out of Iran and its plans for nuclear dependence and -- and perhaps eventually dominance.</p><p>Are you writing -- are any of your insurance companies writing any policies related to that risk of Iran?</p><p>BUFFET: We exclude nuclear (INAUDIBLE). But that's been true generally for a long time. We exclude. And the nuclear risk is one that all the resources of the insurance industry can't handle. So it would be folly to write it, because people wouldn't get the protection they thought they were getting.</p><p>So nuclear is out of the question.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, are you concerned about what is happening in Iran and -- and do you see an eventual military tension between U.S.-Iran or -- or Iran and Israel, which would eventually, perhaps, draw in the United States?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, I don't think I know much about how it's going to work. And I am deeply suspicious of other people who claim to know what's going to happen exactly.</p><p>I think the future is often very hard to know.</p><p>CLAMAN: Trans -- we already talked about TransCanada.</p><p>Let's -- let's just quickly move on to your -- your lifestyle.</p><p>What newspapers or Web sites do you guys read every morning?</p><p>We have a lot of viewers who asked about this.</p><p>Bill, every morning, what do you reach for?</p><p>GATES: Well, I read \"New York Times,\" \"Wall Street Journal.\" \"The Economist\" is sort of my regular weekly fare.</p><p>BUFFET: He -- he can give you last week's by memory. He -- he knows every word.</p><p>GATES: No, it's great, it's great to have something you read on a regular basis. And they do special sections.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, what do you read?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, I agree with Bill. I think the best one publication I read is \"The Economist.\"..</p><p>CLAMAN: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MUNGER: -- which is interesting.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, well, I read that, but I -- I -- I read the local paper. I read the \"FT.\" I read \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I read \"The New York Times\" and I -- and I read \"USA Today.\"</p><p>CLAMAN: What do you watch on TV?</p><p>People wanted to know that, aside from sports, because I know you're a big sports fan.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, well, I watch sports and I watch the Sunday news shows and -- and...</p><p>CLAMAN: Is there one you prefer?</p><p>BUFFET: No, I...</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you try to (INAUDIBLE) all...</p><p>BUFFET: I watch them all.</p><p>CLAMAN: You watch them all?</p><p>BUFFET: I watch them all. And I -- I have them taped and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CLAMAN: Oh, so you are technical?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: No, my wife does it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: And -- oh, what else do I watch here?</p><p>CLAMAN: I mean is there a show you think out there is clever?</p><p>GATES: Well, Comedy Ctrl is clever.</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, of course.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>GATES: It's certainly, in a political season, there's a lot to make fun of.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Speaking of which, one of our viewers, one of our, actually, our viewer Twitterers had asked, \"Who do you think might be a good vice presidential candidate for Mitt Romney?\"</p><p>Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: I haven't the faintest idea. I have some people I don't think should qualify.</p><p>CLAMAN: Who?</p><p>MUNGER: Oh, I'm not going to say.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: I was hoping you'd ask him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MUNGER: It would be a long list.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, what do you think?</p><p>BUFFET: I think he shouldn't -- I think he would -- I think, largely, he will. I think he should pick somebody who he thinks would be best qualified to serve as president of the United States if anything happened to him. And -- and though people don't vote for the vice presidential candidate very -- to any great degree, so he can afford himself the luxury of doing that. And I think that he probably is the kind of person that will.</p><p>CLAMAN: Here's another Twitter person who wanted to know, \"What is the most significant motivator in your working life and how has that changed through the years?\"</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GATES: Well, I've kind of shifted from the innovations at Microsoft, which are great digital empowerment things, to helping the poorest. And so figures like how many less children died this year than last year, you know, pretty exciting to see that we're getting that number down.</p><p>You know, there's still a lot of science (ph), but it's -- it's aimed at the poorest now.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, your biggest motivator?</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, I -- just -- just running Berkshire is -- it's -- it's fun every day. And it's a never finished painting. And it's always got enough twists and turns in it to make it interesting.</p><p>So I know -- I know I'll have -- you know, I could -- I could be my age and retire and I could spend all week planning my haircut, you know. And this is a lot more fun.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: I want to thank all of you, <person><nameText>Bill Gates, </nameText></person>Charlie Munger and <person><nameText>Warren Buffet...</nameText></person></p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you .</p><p>CLAMAN: -- for joining us exclusively together.

And as we look at how it's trading, it is up slightly, about .5 percent.</p><p>What do you think of that trade?</p><p>Do you think it would have been higher, lower?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, that doesn't change my conclusion, because of some half a percent. And, you know, I don't -- I have no idea whether Berkshire's stock will go up or down in the next week or month or year.</p><p>But in relation to the businesses we own, it -- it's attractive.</p><p>CLAMAN: One of the number one questions that came out this weekend -- it was interesting to me, because I've been coming six years and I have never heard so many people ask why isn't Berkshire paying a dividend. This at a time when the largest percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies are now paying dividends. It's the first time in a long time that they are.</p><p>And then you have the fact that you own dividend paying stocks like Coca-Cola, American Express, Intel, which just raised its dividend this morning, by the way.</p><p>Why won't you pay a dividend to your shareholders?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, we think our shareholders, five years from now, will be wealthier, counting what they would get from the reinvestment of the dividend. We think they would be -- they'll be wealthier if we hold onto the money.</p><p>Now, we may be wrong in that, but historically we've been right. And if -- if we had paid a dividend over the years our shareholders would be considerably poorer than they -- 10 years ago. And as long as we -- I think we will have the opportunity to invest dollars, to create more than a dollar of present value, we'll retain the money. And when we don't think we can do that we'll either repurchase stock or pay dividends.</p><p>CLAMAN: Is there no way you will ever pay a dividend?</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, some day Berkshire will pay a dividend because it will get so large that it can't use the money, or all of the money that it earns, effectively.</p><p>But -- but we don't think we're at that point, although we're much closer to that point, obviously, than we were 20 years ago.</p><p>CLAMAN: I just mentioned that Coke pays a dividend. Speaking of Coke, the board is mulling a stock split.</p><p>Would you be for a stock split of Coca-Cola?</p><p>BUFFET: I'm -- I'm totally neutral on that. It's -- it's fine with me if they do and it's fine with me if they don't.</p><p>But it -- it won't make any difference to us in terms of the value of our Coca-Cola stock.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. The succession plan was a very major focus here. And you said you'd be very clear about it. You do finally have one person in mind, with two back-ups. I got you to tell us yesterday that it was a he.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: But it is a male?</p><p>BUFFET: It's a male.</p><p>CLAMAN: It is a male. OK. I talked to some shareholders who said it is becoming increasingly evident to them that it's Ajit Jain, who runs your insurance business. Keep going with the poker-faced one, because they say the insurance business is increasingly becoming the -- one of the major important factors, the most important factors for the future of Berkshire and the profits that it brings in.</p><p>BUFFET: Look, I would say this about the insurance business. It's been enormously important in getting us to where we are now. It's still enormously important. It's actually not as important relative to the entirety of Berkshire as it was 10 years ago. We've added more businesses away from insurance.</p><p>But insurance has driven us to where we are presently.</p><p>CLAMAN: And the culture, you said he understands the culture of Berkshire.</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, all three of the candidates understand the culture very well.</p><p>CLAMAN: All right. All three, but Ajit at the top?</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, I --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: When -- when we put you on the board, you'll know.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. All right. Only the board knows.</p><p>You also said about your successor that under your new successor, there will not be much of a derivatives book under Berkshire's umbrella.</p><p>Is that because you feel you really understand derivatives in a way that nobody else does or that they've become dangerous for Berkshire?</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, it -- it -- there isn't that much of a derivatives book right now, if you look at the total value of Berkshire. We've done very little in new revenues. But we have a few and one particularly good sized position in terms of our equity put situation. Only that's nothing compared to what we have in equities overall.</p><p>So it's not a big deal now. I would guess it would be a lesser deal. And -- and partly that's because the rule -- in fact, in a big way that's because the rules have been charged on derivatives. We would not have the derivatives position we have now if the rules had been the same five or 10 years ago in relation to posting of collateral. We think that -- that derivatives become much more dangerous for the individual enterprise when they're required to post collateral.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. You're 81 years old. That's not any news to anybody. But the fact that you were diagnosed with Stage 1 prostate cancer gave some people a start. It is obviously non-aggressive. And you say it's a non- issue. And you won't miss a single day of work due to your treatment, which starts in, what, July?</p><p>BUFFET: Mid-July.</p><p>CLAMAN: Mid-July?</p><p>BUFFET: Yes. Um-hmm.</p><p>CLAMAN: You won't miss any work at all?</p><p>BUFFET: No. No. No. Maybe -- maybe 15 minutes a day, something like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: We can lose you for 15 minutes.</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I wish -- I wish that we couldn't, but the truth is you can't.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: But when you look at the -- the person who will eventually take over, have you begun to apprentice your successor?</p><p>BUFFET: My -- my successor doesn't need apprenticing. If they needed apprenticing, they wouldn't be the successor (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>CLAMAN: They wouldn't be the one?</p><p>BUFFET: No. In fact, none of the three candidates would need apprenticing.</p><p>CLAMAN: In some of what you talked about, you talked about how great some businesses are, but you talked about a big mistake. Energy future --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CLAMAN: -- from a Texas utility company.</p><p>BUFFET: All mine do.</p><p>CLAMAN: So sorry to bring it up.</p><p>BUFFET: I did it by myself.</p><p>CLAMAN: But these were tied very tightly to the price of natural gas.</p><p>BUFFET: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: Which plummeted shortly after you bought it.</p><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: How'd you get that so wrong?</p><p>BUFFET: It was easy. I'll probably be able to do it again.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: The -- it was -- it was -- it was just a case of not -- not cranking that into my decision, weighting it with the appropriate probability.</p><p>CLAMAN: But 2010, you had to do a $2 billion write up -- write-down; 2011, another $398 million write-down.</p><p>How much --</p><p>BUFFET: (INAUDIBLE) that total. But the total -- the total we put in was about $2 billion and -- and I think it's been written out of maybe $400 million or $500 million.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, how much was it going to get?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, it can go all the way to zero.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you think it will?</p><p>BUFFET: It -- it easily could.</p><p>CLAMAN: Who -- who sold you on this idea, gold (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>BUFFET: Me. Me.</p><p>CLAMAN: Really?</p><p>BUFFET: No, no, no.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CLAMAN: Goldman Sachs?</p><p>BUFFET: No, I -- I have -- I have a real ability to pick these -- pick these out.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>One of the things you said that people sat on the edge of their seat, because they want to know what you're buying, more newspapers.</p><p>BUFFET: It's possible.</p><p>CLAMAN: Jimmy Kimmel told a joke at the Washington correspondents dinner. He said, what's black, white and red all over?</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, so I heard.</p><p>CLAMAN: Nothing.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yet you're buying now?</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: And you said specifically local newspapers.</p><p>How about \"The New York Times?\"</p><p>Is that local enough?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I -- if a -- I would have to say, if I could buy \"The New York Times,\" I might buy it personally. I -- I don't know whether I'd buy it for Berkshire. But it's not for sale.</p><p>It's -- that's a very special case.</p><p>The newspapers that exist in communities where there's a strong sense of community and where the newspapers respond to that strong sense of community by -- by telling people a whole lot of things that they want to know about their own community that they can't find some place else, those newspapers will do OK. They'll still be in decline over time.</p><p>CLAMAN: But is it that you see that their value is relatively -- that their price is relatively cheap to earnings?</p><p>BUFFET: In some cases.</p><p>CLAMAN: Um-hmm.</p><p>BUFFET: In some cases. But the earnings are not going to -- the earnings are not going to go up. I mean you're looking -- and -- and they're probably going to go down in most -- in practically all cases.</p><p>So you have to buy them at a value, actually, that takes that into account.</p><p>CLAMAN: \"The Washington Post,\" you stepped down from the board.</p><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: But you still fully own your position?</p><p>BUFFET: We own every share we've ever owned.</p><p>CLAMAN: Even though it's off its 52 week highs.</p><p>Do you feel it's doing pretty well?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, it -- I don't know whether they've published their first quarter earnings yet or not. But -- but they have problems in two of their businesses, one in the education business and one in the newspaper. And -- and that's been reflected, I think, in the price.</p><p>But those two businesses are -- well, the newspaper is far tougher than it was five or 10 years ago. And the education business is tougher than it was about two years ago.</p><p>CLAMAN: What's interesting to people, though, when you say that you would buy more newspapers is at a time when everybody else is getting out, it seems like you and Rupert Murdoch are the only people getting into newspapers.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, right. And he may not be quite as competitive for a while, either. So, no. But they are not a -- it's not an industry whose earnings are going to -- the earnings are going to just shrink in the newspaper business, as are the revenues. But not -- I don't necessarily think they'll shrink at a dramatic rate where you have a strong feeling of community and you have a newspaper that serves that community well.</p><p>CLAMAN: \"The Washington Post\" reported Friday and their revenue --</p><p>BUFFET: Did they?</p><p>OK.</p><p>CLAMAN: -- fell.</p><p>Yes, their revenue fell. Well, speaking of Rupert Murdoch, because I brought it up, hoc, is the head of News Corp, the parent of Fox Business.</p><p>BUFFET: Sure.</p><p>CLAMAN: You -- you made a little quip about our sister network, Fox. One shareholder questioned whether your personal politics --</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: -- hurt shares of the company. And your response was, \"I really think someone making an investment decision based on the politics of whether he agrees or not with the CEO, sounds to me like he ought to own Fox.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: I'll leave it at that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: What -- what do you mean by that?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I mean, I think it's silly to make a decision --</p><p>CLAMAN: Right.</p><p>BUFFET: -- based on the politics of the CEO. I -- I can't tell you the politics of the CEOs of our major investments. There may be one or two that I would know about, but it is absolutely a zero factor in our making a decision on a business.</p><p>CLAMAN: I guess maybe people were really meaning that they're in contradiction, they feel differently about the Buffett Rule than you do.</p><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: You clarified in September to Fox Business News that what you meant was the uber rich should pay a commensurate tax rate of about 30 percent, that a let -- a lot of the rest of Americans are paying.</p><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yet the Buffet -- yet the Obama administration kind of took it in a different way and is now promoting it for people who make a million dollars or more.</p><p>Have you talked to the president about how he's split from what you really intended?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, that isn't really different than what I intended. I mean, I might tweak it a little bit in one direction or another. But I was talking about the people making a million or more.</p><p>Now I would probably have a different break, also, for the people making $10 million or more.</p><p>But the -- Senator Whitehouse is the one that put the bill in. And I wrote him a letter immediately after he did so that in -- I -- I basically approve of his bill. If I were writing the bill, I'd write it a little -- slightly different, but so would everybody else.</p><p>But I -- I think it -- it gets at the -- it gets at the point that 131 out of 400 of the highest incomes in the country, those 400 incomes average $270 million each. That's not bad. That's, you know, almost three quarters of a million dollars a day. And --</p><p>CLAMAN: We'd take it.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes. And a -- a third of those people paid less than a 15 percent rate, combined payroll and income tax.</p><p>And I -- I think -- I think that's wrong and I think it -- and in an economy where we're going to ask for shared sacrifice of people, that we ought to go after the (INAUDIBLE). It doesn't solve the revenue problem.</p><p>But I think that people want a code that has at least that much fairness in it.</p><p>CLAMAN: But, Warren, if you feel so strongly about that, why not take a bigger salary than you always have?</p><p>You've always opted to take your income in cash -- in -- in Berkshire stock versus cash.</p><p>Yet if you took a bigger salary instead, you could pay that 30 percent rate.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Why not have done it that way?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, the company would get a deduction, too. So the government would be -- would be worse off rather than wise (ph), actually, because the company would get a 35 percent deduction if they paid it to me.</p><p>So it's -- it -- it wouldn't change the revenue, it would just take some money from the shareholders.</p><p>CLAMAN: Here's what -- what I heard from some other people, too, is they said, you know, when you're donating most of your -- your money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is philanthropic and wonderful and yet that will keep it from being taxed.</p><p>And some would say, why not then let it be taxed, because it -- wouldn't it be helpful to give it as revenue to the government?</p><p>BUFFET: That would be an alternative. But I -- I think that we will probably be able to accomplish a lot more around the world with that money going to the foundation.</p><p>But it -- it's a wonderful tax dodge. I urge all you -- all the viewers if they -- if they want to pay less tax, they should give away more money.</p><p>CLAMAN: Investments -- what other countries are you investing in?</p><p>You mentioned an acquisition in the Netherlands.</p><p>But what other countries' companies are starting to look good to you?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, we don't really look by country. That -- that company in the Netherlands was for sale. I mean the owners of it decided to sell it a month or so ago and -- and we ended up buying it last week.</p><p>CLAMAN: Right.</p><p>BUFFET: But we don't look much by country. It -- we -- we really look for businesses we understand, with some kind of competitive advantage and good management and a price that makes sense.</p><p>And if we find that -- we found, you know, the most wonderful of all in Israel six or seven years ago. And we've -- we can find them here in the United States, usually.</p><p>CLAMAN: And that was ISCAR?</p><p>BUFFET: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: You said that there was a $22 billion deal that you missed by that much. You couldn't get that deal done. You wouldn't say what sector it was in.</p><p>Can you say what country it was in?</p><p>BUFFET: No, it was -- but it was on this planet.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: I tried.</p><p>BUFFET: Well, you narrowed it down.</p><p>CLAMAN: How does Brazil look for investment right now?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I -- I --</p><p>CLAMAN: See anything you like in Brazil?</p><p>BUFFET: I --</p><p>CLAMAN: How about that?</p><p>BUFFET: Well, I don't know that much about specific -- (INAUDIBLE). I mean, if we found something that was interesting in Brazil, some business I understood, it was large, the price was right. The management was right, we'd buy it in a second.</p><p>CLAMAN: You have bought some European stocks recently.</p><p>BUFFET: That is true.</p><p>CLAMAN: Which ones?</p><p>I mean it's going to come out in an SEC filing eventually, won't it?</p><p>BUFFET: No, actually, we don't have to report the foreign stocks.</p><p>CLAMAN: You don't have to report it?</p><p>BUFFET: No.</p><p>CLAMAN: So you won't say?</p><p>BUFFET: No, that's true.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. But would you say, 10, 11, 12 coun -- companies?</p><p>BUFFET: It was about -- I think it was more like nine.</p><p>CLAMAN: Nine?</p><p>BUFFET: Um-hmm.</p><p>CLAMAN: This morning, folks, when <person><nameText>Warren Buffet </nameText></person>arrived here at our shoot, he quickly went upstairs to put in stock orders.</p><p>European stock orders?</p><p>BUFFET: Not today.</p><p>CLAMAN: Not today.</p><p>So at -- U.S. equities?</p><p>BUFFET: That's what's left, yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: Because I did say it was on this planet, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: U.S. equities look cheap then at this point, with the markets the way they are today?</p><p>BUFFET: Some do.</p><p>CLAMAN: Some do.</p><p>BUFFET: Some do, sure.</p><p>CLAMAN: Let's talk about the news of the weekend, as well. Nicolas Sarkozy is out in France.</p><p>BUFFET: He's out. Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: And Francois Hollande, who is, of course, a Socialist, is in.</p><p>This is disconcerting to a lot of people who wonder, will we see capital flight away from France, the likes of what we saw when Francois Mitterand, who was also a Socialist, was elected years ago.</p><p>Will people take their money out of France?</p><p>Do you predict that or could you see that?</p><p>BUFFET: I -- I don't know the answer to that. I -- I would not be enthused if I had a Socialist win anyplace. But -- but the -- I think the problems facing Europe transcend, almost, you know, those in any specific country. I mean they have to work out the rules under which 17 countries can really work together. When they lock themselves into a monetary unit. And they haven't locked themselves in in a number of other ways.</p><p>So, I think overall what happens in Europe is probably maybe affected by the leaders in given countries, but it's going to be much more important than any specific election.</p><p>CLAMAN: You just said locked into a specific currency. Was the euro idea a mistake?</p><p>BUFFETT: Getting out of it would be an enormous problem, too, but I think maybe it was a mistake. As it was done. In fact, I can say it was a mistake as it was done. Now the question is whether you can modify the original concept in some way that makes this more workable than it is proving to be.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, as it morphs and changes, Greece has parliamentary elections and neo-Nazis were elected to the parliament. Is it just a matter of time before Greece either leaves or gets jettisoned from the euro zone?</p><p>BUFFETT: I don't know about - I think it's a matter of time until they come up with a better solution than the present structure or they abandon it entirely. Who knows which it will happen?</p><p>CLAMAN: Forty-seven years later from you starting your company, you finally invested in a technology stock or two. IBM and Intel --</p><p>BUFFETT: Yes, I didn't - I didn't do the Intel.</p><p>CLAMAN: You didn't do the Intel. You did the IMB.</p><p>BUFFETT: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Who did the Intel?</p><p>BUFFETT: Yes, it would have been Todd because he was the only one -</p><p>CLAMAN: OK. Todd did -- Todd Holmes, who is one of your new investment managers. It was his idea. But you never bought Microsoft. Did you hear from your board member <person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>about that?</p><p>BUFFETT: I can't buy -- I can't buy Microsoft. If we bought Microsoft, for one thing, our buying days take place month after month after month. And if something happened that was favorable at Microsoft, people would have said I had insider information.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, actually, let's bring in <person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>right now, who founded Microsoft -</p><p>BUFFETT: Maybe he'll give me some insider information!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFETT: Now's the time.</p><p>CLAMAN: What's inside information at Microsoft (ph)?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: When you heard that he finally bought a technology stock and IBM and Intel, did you think those were pretty good ideas?</p><p><person><nameText>BILL GATES, </nameText></person>FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: Well, I think it is great that Todd gets the entire universe to exercise his great thinking. And he has done a good job there.</p><p>A lot of technology companies, you can't see where they will be in 10 years or 20 years. IBM has enough service revenue that they may be somewhat of an exception to that. But most tech stocks, you know, play a very high- variance game, which makes it I think the most interesting in the street in the world. But not for an investor who wants any degree of downside protection.</p><p>BUFFETT: He told me that when I met him in 1991, too.</p><p>And what point should be made about Todd. Todd can change his positions far, far easier than I can. So, Todd is working with sums. If he decides to move onto something else, he can - he can do that. I can't do that with the big positions that we take. So, we are really locked in more than he would be.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, you just said that with many tech stocks, you can't see where they will be in ten to 20 years. Can you see, Warren, where Facebook would be in 10 to 20 years?</p><p>BUFFETT: No, no I can't. I mean, it is an enormously impressive accomplishment. And my guess is it has a big future of some sort. But I have no idea. I didn't even know what it was six or seven years ago. And I'm still not on it, so -</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, are you on Facebook?</p><p>GATES: Sure.</p><p>CLAMAN: You are on Twitter as well.</p><p>BUFFETT: He's in a different world.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Always have been. In fact, I remember when you were saying Bill had to teach you how to just simply click on the blue E for Explorer.</p><p>BUFFETT: He's had his problems with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GATES: Well, Warren's a big tech user (ph) if you count online bridge.</p><p>CLAMAN: That's right.</p><p>GATES: That takes him up into the top one percent in terms of Internet addicts.</p><p>BUFFETT: I'm like a guy who's (INAUDIBLE) to turn on the switch. And then, as far as I'm concerned, there's some guy inside that thing that's playing - (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Listen, let's talk about Facebook. It's huge news today. The beginning of the road show.</p><p>Bill, you have been dealing with investors and analysts for years and banks for years and years. Would you tell Mark Zuckerberg -- because there is question as to whether he will attend the road show. Would you say, you know, you really should get out there and do it?</p><p>GATES: I know when Microsoft had to do its road show, I minimized the amount of time. I think I offered three days, I told them no limousines. I took a book about biology. I was reading during the breaks. I tried not to have it take too much time away from the business. You know, so, you've got to focus on what is important in making sure your profit friend (ph) users is great -- as number one</p><p>BUFFETT: This is a guy that negotiated down with his mother (INAUDIBLE) down to an hour over the time he was willing to spend with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GATES: Well, I didn't know what I was in for. I thought --</p><p>CLAMAN: Didn't want to spend more than an hour with Buffett? Your mom said meet the guy, and --</p><p>GATES: Before Warren and I met, I wasn't sure we had that much to talk about. Now, I was 100 percent wrong about that, but my mom made me say I would stay a few hours at this event that Kay, Graham and Warren were at. In fact, I stayed the whole day, and I was disappointed when Warren was leaving because talking about business and the dynamics of how things were changing I found somebody I'm part of -- one of the most interesting parts of my life. A lifelong conversation.</p><p>BUFFETT: His mom was prying us apart at the end.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: What would you advise Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook to attend that road show?</p><p>BUFFETT: I wouldn't worry too much. I mean - you know, that offering was going to be big. I'm not saying the stock is going to go, but it is going to get all the attention in the world. And people know what Facebook is. I mean, it's not a mystery that has to be explained.</p><p>CLAMAN: Can it --</p><p>BUFFETT: Except to me!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: If -- if it does have $100 billion valuation or whatever the crazy numbers are out there, can it sustain that? What does it need to do to sustain that? What does it need to do to sustain that, Bill?</p><p>GATES: Well, it just needs to have advertising revenue that makes that earnings dream properly discounted be greater than $100 billion.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GATES: And -</p><p>CLAMAN: Simple!</p><p>GATES: It's right there in \"The Intelligent Investor\"!</p><p>You know, they have a lot of traffic. And the ability to monetize that traffic over time will be fascinating to see if they can push up and go beyond the earnings stream you need for that or not. But it is one phenomenally impressive company.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, everybody is always talking about the succession plan. And you know, you went through this very issue back when you decided to leave the CEO position at Microsoft. The stock has done really well lately, and Windows 8 is about to blast onto the scene. And I hear from -- Recover Silicon Valley heavily at Fox Business. And I hear from them that once Windows 8 gets into the ultra-books and it becomes a touch screen, you could very well take on the Mac Air and the MacBook.</p><p>Is that what Microsoft should be aiming for, and do you think it could happen with Ultra Books?</p><p>GATES: Well, it is very exciting that Windows 8 is coming out. It's a very big deal for the company. Steve and the whole team are doing a great job there. It creates a new category of machines that are sort of -- have the good things about tablets and the good things about PCs. And so, it's going to evolve these digital tools.</p><p>You know, people right now like the tablet, but it's hard to -</p><p>CLAMAN: Type on.</p><p>GATES: -- to give input. You don't have Microsoft Office on there. And so, with our hardware partners, there's a lot of neat stuff that comes out later year.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, what kind of computer do you use?</p><p>BUFFETT: I think it's an HP that the guys at the furniture market (ph) sent over.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, what do you use, Bill?</p><p>GATES: Well, I have a Samsung tablet is my primary machine, but I have Dell machines and a variety. I'm always getting the latest and greatest.</p><p>CLAMAN: So, no iPad for you.</p><p>GATES: No, no, -- I said I am using the latest and greatest.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFETT: Bill has -- they have a chimpanzee up there in Seattle, and then they have me and then they have us both test these new things.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And, actually, I am more reliable than the chimpanzee.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you have an iPad, Warren?</p><p>BUFFETT: No.</p><p>CLAMAN: No. So, you're not going for the tablet at this point.</p><p>Bill, let's just say the Samsung Galaxy has gone traction, but not nearly as much as the iPad has. Rim couldn't come out with a tablet that smacked it down nor hp.</p><p>What company out there has the special something that can take on that iPad in your opinion?</p><p>GATES: Well, the tablets base is going to grow, but you really want something where you either have a pen or keyboard and you have your productivity applications. So, you want the best of both worlds, and that is what Microsoft and others are pushing for.</p><p>I think this fall, people will understand that there is room for big improvement there.</p><p>CLAMAN: Microsoft just made a pretty big deal, about $300 million with Barnes &amp; Noble. Will eventually that morph into a deal to make some type of tablet or a Kindle with Microsoft abilities to jack it up?</p><p>GATES: Well, the idea is they are going to take their reading experience and books and make them look super good on these new devices. And so, on these devices, you want to run Office where you create documents. But you want to consume books in new ways, consume videos in new ways. And so, it's that merger and having their team do innovative work is what made that investment a smart idea.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, you said this weekend you would not buy Apple.</p><p>BUFFETT: Well, I said I wouldn't know enough to buy Apple. Yes. But no, I'm not going to buy anything I don't feel I can have a reasonable fix on what they will look like in five or ten years. And I certainly didn't have a reasonable fix - I wish I had -- ten years ago on Apple but I don't have one now.</p><p>I think it's an amazing company. But there are lots of businesses I don't understand.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, tech companies have gotten so desperate to have the latest and greatest technology that they are trying to buy in in patents. They're trying to buy chunks of patents, you know, with the Motorola mobility issue. Today, a judge is going to consider, I believe, that Microsoft's complaint that Motorola is charging for what really should be basic technology patents.</p><p>Have the patent wars gotten a little out of hand?</p><p>GATES: No, I think the idea that invention is valuable has become more obvious. It was always true in the drug industry that the whole industry, these miracle medicine exists, because patents were protecting that invention.</p><p>And fortunately, we are seeing more invention in many areas. The IT sector has got a lot, but you know, if you come up with a renewable energy design, that is going to be protected by a patent.</p><p>So, patents are important. There are immensely complex, and sometimes when people look at it either because of the complexity of the system because they haven't looked into it, it seems strange to them. But the idea that invention has value - I think that is an idea that is more and more important over time.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren?</p><p>BUFFETT: Oh, I agree. I just don't know how to invent anything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: There have been a couple of corporate scandals. Among them, Apple and Foxconn. Foxconn is one of the manufacturers of components of Apple's products. They were accused of mistreating their workers and in some cases underpaying them.</p><p>Did Apple handle that right? Would you care if you found out that one of your companies under the Berkshire umbrella was buying a lot of stuff from people who mistreated their workers?</p><p>BUFFETT: Sure, and we hope that all our companies are looking at all kinds of things including that. But f you have a very, very large company something is going to go wrong. And right now I can tell you with 270,000 employees at Berkshire, someone is doing something they shouldn't. I just hope it is small, I hope we find out about it, and then I hope whoever is in charge does something about it properly but you cannot run a large army or a large government bureau or large church without things going wrong from time to time. It's going to happen.</p><p>CLAMAN: It is going to happen but this Foxconn issue was out there. Wired Magazine a year and a half ago had a huge front-page story about it, Bill. I'm just wondering -- had that ever happened to you at Microsoft? Would you look at that and say Apple really should have dealt with that much more quickly?</p><p>GATES: I think American companies overall are improving labor conditions when they're involved in whether it is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or really looking down the supply chain at trying to make sure labor conditions are okay, I think American business has had a positive effect. I don't know specifics of the Apple case but I know they are not going to try to take shortcuts in that way. They are certainly very focused on fixing any problems at this point.</p><p>CLAMAN: You mentioned the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That's pretty controversial with Wal-Mart lately and a lot of people saying hey, that is how you get business done in Mexico. What is your response to that?</p><p>BUFFETT: My responses is that we have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It may very well be that's the way business is done in Mexico but you'd better not do it if you are an American corporation.</p><p>CLAMAN: Maybe the crime was less important than the cover-up.</p><p>BUFFETT: It's always a problem. I mean, I know something's being done that's wrong at Berkshire, I can't tell what it is and --</p><p>CLAMAN: But Warren, if somebody came to you and you knew about it, like the Wal-Mart top executives did, would you say \"don't be so aggressive on that?\"</p><p>BUFFETT: No, but I think almost all CEOs when they know the facts - - it certainly seems quite clear there was bribery in all of that. Exactly what happened after that, I'm not sure about, but I would think there are very few American CEOs that if they find out about some problems, they're going to try to figure out something to do and something about them promptly.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, earlier we were talking with Warren about how he wants to buy more newspapers.</p><p>GATES: He's not going to compete with me.</p><p>CLAMAN: You are not going to buy newspapers? Because he got the idea to buy railroads back in 2006 from you. You were already in a Canadian railroad.</p><p>GATES: No, Warren's has been playing with railroads since he was a boy.</p><p>BUFFETT: That's right.</p><p>GATES: I can hardly take credit for introducing him to that whole sector of the economy.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm repeating what he told me.</p><p>GATES: He's very generous. We both made good money. We're happy railroad investors.</p><p>CLAMAN: You both -- and I knew this about Warren, but I didn't know you used to be a newspaper delivery boy.</p><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely. I was far better than Warren. It's really one of those things that needs more coverage.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>BUFFETT: I was there yesterday, he didn't show up.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>CLAMAN: We got video of it. There was a newspaper throwing contest where we all tossed Omaha World Heralds to the porch of a Clayton home.</p><p>GATES: Exactly.</p><p>CLAMAN: I was stunned to see, here's Warren, you made it right to the porch, and then Bill exactly in the same position, that little boy is one of your grandsons.</p><p>GATES: He won that.</p><p>BUFFETT: I own the house and the newspaper, I better be close enough.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>GATES: When it came to ping-pong, I would say I was a little better. We're 1 to 1 for the weekend.</p><p>BUFFETT: That's right.</p><p>[CROSSTALK]</p><p>CLAMAN: 2 on 1. Then you brought up the gigantic paddle.</p><p>BUFFETT: That didn't work either. [laughter]</p><p>CLAMAN: In the past you've done a lot of things. You've danced with the Nebraska cheerleaders. You've ridden a bull. That must have been incredible. Back then when you were doing it, you were in your 70s. They are both looking at the monitor.</p><p>BUFFETT: Absolutely. I look as bad as I look there as I do here.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, your vice chairman, never participates in sitting on the bull or throwing the newspapers, why not?</p><p>BUFFETT: He's the thinker in the group.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>CLAMAN: In fact here he is, Charlie Munger, the vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway, joining us now. Good morning Charlie. Welcome to the party here.</p><p>CHARLIE MUNGER, VICE CHAIR, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlies, there was so much focus this weekend on Warren's health and his succession plan and how much longer Warren will be running the company. Let's turn it to you, how much longer will you be up on stage with Warren for these annual shareholder meetings?</p><p>MUNGER: I serve a very important function because people look at me and think they will get another seven years out of Warren. I don't think he's anxious to get rid of me.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>BUFFETT: I'm there to show there's some guy older than me in American business. Makes me look very good when I'm up there.</p><p>CLAMAN: How much longer will you participate? Somebody said is this Charlie's last year?</p><p>MUNGER: No.</p><p>BUFFETT: Well, I hope not.</p><p>CLAMAN: You have every plan to remain on the stage at these meetings?</p><p>MUNGER: I'm not going to sit up there drooling. But I plan to be there. If the only way to get up is to drool, then I'll drool.</p><p>CLAMAN: You were as feisty as ever. One comment you made got a round of applause from the audience that was on the mortgage and lending bubble. And you said this -- this is stuff you have said over the past couple of years, but you've never phrased it like this before, you said it was wrong not to stamp down on felony and folly of all that irresponsible lending, quote I often say \"Alan Greenspan overdosed on Ayn Rand.\" Meaning the whole free market hands-off approach was a total disaster?</p><p>MUNGER: Certainly. Most of these have limits. In other words, an ax murderer is not a good thing because it happens in a free market. There's a limit to when the free market is -- [inaudible] a free market with that kind of fraud and folly it is not wise to allow it. We were disgraceful to sit there and let Canada be sensible while we went crazy.</p><p>BUFFETT: I would say this in, in fairness to Alan Greenspan and Charlie has made this point that he has said that he's sort of overestimated -- overestimated the ability of the free market to natural operations to rein in -- all the self-interest that --</p><p>MUNGER: Yes, Alan Greenspan is the only person who has apologized.</p><p>CLAMAN: Who else should apologize?</p><p>MUNGER: There's a big list, practically everybody.</p><p>CLAMAN: Banks, U.S. banks?</p><p>MUNGER: Oh, my God, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Dodd Frank, now we have that, but the last numbers I looked at, it is 850 pages long. The Volcker Rule alone breaks down to 380 plus questions and those have more than 1400 sub-questions. Will that be the thing that prevents us from dealing with this type of disaster again?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, it was certainly a step in the right direction. If I had the power, I would have made the Volcker act look like a non-restraint. I would have done much more.</p><p>CLAMAN: So you think that preventing banks from investing in the proprietary trading issue? They are all complaining, Charlie, that that's ruining their ability to do well and do well for shareholders.</p><p>MUNGER: Well, that's natural when people were making a lot of money out of something to not want to be forced out of it. These banks ought to only be open on Christmas. They ought to have a fairly restricted repertoire.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, we the taxpayers bailed out a lot of them, including AIG. In the news today is the Treasury Department will try and sell off more taxpayer holdings of AIG. Do you think the bailout of AIG was something we had to do?</p><p>MUNGER: Probably.</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you think the taxpayer, Warren, will see a profit on that?</p><p>BUFFETT: Yes, the way it is going, they will show a profit, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, do you think so?</p><p>MUNGER: Barely.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>BUFFETT: He hated to say that.</p><p>CLAMAN: There's belief, trying to jump-start the economy, that if you get rid of onerous regulation -- not all regulation, but onerous regulation -- that businesses will invest more and grow more. You guys own businesses, Lubrizol which is heavily regulated I'm sure, Burlington Northern the railroad heavily regulated. The regulations -- if the regulations were diluted just a bit, would you invest more, that would mean more hiring and the economy would come back?</p><p>MUNGER: The answer is no. Sure there are regulations that don't make any sense out there and there always will be. It is a very big complicated economy, but we are dying to make investments and we invested more money last year than we ever have in the history of Berkshire and we'll break that record again this year. American corporations have lots and lots and lots of liquidity, and where they see demand, they're going to invest in facilities that meet that demand.</p><p>CLAMAN: No matter what?</p><p>MUNGER: Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, in your high-tech field, what regulation do you think -- he just talked about regulations that should be banished but what regulation holds you back that you really feel shouldn't be there?</p><p>GATES: I think the closest thing to that is whether or not an engineer who is trained in the United States but is a foreign citizen, it should be easy for them and they should be allowed to be a taxpayer here or they should be forced to go back and the jobs around them created in another country. So the high-tech, high-skills immigration issue is one that definitely affects the job picture.</p><p>CLAMAN: Senator John Kerry has the Startup Visa Act which would if there's a foreigner give them a green card if they have enough investment, they start a business, and they would hire some people, is that something, Charlie, you think is a good idea?</p><p>MUNGER: Yes, but I think Bill's idea is a much bigger idea. I think we're out of our minds to send brilliant people back when they want to stay here.</p><p>BUFFETT: I feel stronger about that than I used to. I mean it is crazy.</p><p>MUNGER: -- could be stronger.</p><p>BUFFETT: It just makes no sense. Bill gave you the best answer you could have on it.</p><p>CLAMAN: Why then do we have it, we make it so difficult with the H1B visa, which is the issue, would you say if you had the opportunity, Bill, to have the president's ear on that issue, surely he knows?</p><p>GATES: There are various things that have not gotten through the Congress, you know, people want to make sure you're doing your best to hire American workers, and so there's a legitimate concern there. But there's a way to be more liberal on this without at all substituting for domestic labor -- labor that you might have used.</p><p>CLAMAN: You have a lot of people that are worried about -- they marry the issue of the border with Mexico with brilliant engineers who are coming from India and China. Is there a way to separate that? Would it be a better idea, Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: Of course it would be a better idea, of course it should be done. This is a competitive world, you do not want to send the brains back.</p><p>BUFFETT: What bill is talking about would increase employment in the United States.</p><p>CLAMAN: Brains. You bought some brains in China, Charlie. BYD, the electric car company, it is fun to see you two disagree on stage. You disagreed about the VAT tax. Charlie thinks we should have a VAT tax. Later, Warren, you told me you didn't think that was a good idea.</p><p>BUFFETT: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Going to electric vehicles, you feel, Charlie, that we should be giving government incentives and real carrots to inspire people to drive more electric vehicles; correct?</p><p>MUNGER: We already do. I have a niece and her husband who commute in Washington, D.C. and because they ride in a Prius, they get to use the fast lane. That's a huge incentive.</p><p>CLAMAN: There's an incentive.</p><p>MUNGER: There is a lot of incentive and there should be.</p><p>CLAMAN: Should it be, Warren, at the expense because the money has to come from somewhere, at big oil, which is well-established and is getting a lot of tax breaks?</p><p>BUFFETT: Charlie is the expert on this subject.</p><p>CLAMAN: Should we sort of lessen what we have given to the oil companies over the years and switch it over to electric vehicles?</p><p>MUNGER: I don't think the big problem of America is the oil companies have been favored too much.</p><p>CLAMAN: You don't think that's a problem?</p><p>MUNGER: Yes, by and large. Exxon is a technical meritocracy which is a very creditable place. In other words, if more of America ran like Exxon, it would be a better country.</p><p>CLAMAN: Let's get to Keystone, then. The Keystone pipeline was rejected initially. Now the new proposal from Transcanada is going. You are both Nebraska residents -- you live in California now, Charlie, but you're from Nebraska. You are also business people. The new route and when we get more details we will know but would you be for the Keystone pipeline if it doesn't threaten the aquifer and it doesn't threaten the areas that are culturally sensitive and environmentally sensitive?</p><p>BUFFETT: I'm not an expert, but it generally sounds like it makes a lot of sense to me. Awful lot of pipelines running through the United States. Net, they have certainly been a huge plus for the country. I don't know all the details on it, but based on what I know, I would say that it makes sense.</p><p>CLAMAN: Were you then disappointed when Keystone was rejected, it could mean so many jobs?</p><p>BUFFETT: I don't think that issue is done with yet. The jobs aspect of it is not the big aspect. The real question is what it will do for the country over many years and what the drawbacks are. But you can build anything that will create jobs. That doesn't mean it is a good idea.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, you are invested in alternative energy and some of it a certain subsector of nuclear, but looking at natural gas, wow, it is so unbelievably inexpensive now and cleaner than oil, do you think this country should be converting to nat gas burning cars and trucks?</p><p>GATES: Well, natural gas, unfortunately, the energy density unless you take it to a very low temperature is much lower, so there's a lot of innovators looking at how can we do that better. There are ways of converting natural gas to liquids, but those factories are very expensive so people are going to try to innovate. There's such good news that we have inexpensive natural gas. It is the most natural that we get the benefit of that in the power generation sector as we're turning over our power plants, but because the price is so attractive on an equivalent energy basis there will be innovations that move it into parts of the transport sector, that's very exciting.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, you said on stage this weekend we should not look for energy independence, we should use up the bad guys' energy --</p><p>MUNGER: Or the good guys, like Canada.</p><p>CLAMAN: Or the good guys but conserve our own.</p><p>MUNGER: Right. That to me is an obvious conclusion considering how precious this stuff is going to get. Trying to use our whole supply, our reserves as fast as possible is insane.</p><p>CLAMAN: But you could arguably stick it to certain Arab nations who despise the United States and they despise Israel and make life difficult for everybody by completely turning off the spigot and not use their oil and then you hit them financially, no?</p><p>MUNGER: My desire to do spiteful things to the Arab nations is zero. As long as they want to sell their oil, I'm delighted to see us buy it rather than use our own. I think that adults suffer now to be better off later. When you save your own oil, and buy the other fellows', that's what you're doing.</p><p>CLAMAN: You drove an electric car, you said the most recent BYD, do you own an electric car?</p><p>MUNGER: No.</p><p>CLAMAN: What do you drive, Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: A Mercedes.</p><p>CLAMAN: What do you drive, Warren?</p><p>BUFFETT: Cadillac.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, what car do you usually use?</p><p>GATES: I have a Mercedes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Two Mercedes. Mercedes is buying advertising right now on Fox Business, so thank you very much, we hope.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>CLAMAN: You both took swipes at business school this weekend which I thought was interesting. You don't think they are teaching the right things. Warren, you went to business school.</p><p>BUFFETT: Apparently.</p><p>CLAMAN: Columbia.</p><p>BUFFETT: And I had a fabulous teacher. I went there because -- two fabulous teachers. And I went there because two people that I really wanted to sit at their feet and I got a chance to do that.</p><p>CLAMAN: And you're generous to business schools. You host more than 40 of them every year --</p><p>BUFFETT: 48.</p><p>CLAMAN: 48, let them come here and take questions. That's certainly wonderful. What is it that business schools are doing wrong?</p><p>BUFFETT: Well, in the investment field I thought that over the last 40 or so years that most -- a great many business schools were teaching nonsense. But that doesn't mean they were in other aspects of other majors within the business schools.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, Charlie, would either of you make a decision to hire somebody based on whether the candidate had gone to business school? Bill?</p><p>GATES: Well, if they are a young person, that's a recent part of their resume, so it might give them some valuable skills. I don't think anybody is saying that business school doesn't have some merit to it. It's just the -- how you do investment valuation as they have tried to apply mathematical techniques, they have claimed more than they should for these techniques.</p><p>BUFFETT: I hired a young woman a couple years ago out of business school, and she would have been very good naturally, but I'm sure she was better because she'd gone to business school, but I didn't hire her for what she learned about investments in the business school.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: I said I thought the business schools were improving, which I think is true, including in the investment field, but they have a lot of room for it.</p><p>CLAMAN: The Buffett rule, that's getting so much attention. Charlie, what did you think when Warren pushed for the Buffett rule and has been quite vocal about it?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, it's caused me some lack of popularity at my country club, and I'm willing to bear it in order to participate in Berkshire. I think it's fine if the rich people pay more taxes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, you know --</p><p>BUFFETT: I think it's fine if he pays more taxes too.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you see the other side of it that, oh, the wealthy are the ones who are paying the biggest amount of taxes and that a large percentage of people don't pay any taxes aside from sales taxes, etcetera? That whole argument.</p><p>BUFFETT: Well the etcetera is payroll taxes.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>BUFFETT: Payroll taxes are $800 billion of a $2.3 trillion dono -- revenue thing. So payroll taxes are a huge element of our revenue base.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, I don't like the idea that nobody but the rich should pay taxes, because the country can't work on taxes from the rich people. It won't produce enough. And it would have terrible economic effects.</p><p>So I don't like this politics of envy style of -- of discourse.</p><p>But I think the rich people should cheerfully pay more taxes.</p><p>CLAMAN: We already talked to Warren about the developments in Europe this morning, with France turning socialist with Francois Hollande, who's the Socialist president. The U.S. banks, Warren, you said were in a far, far better position. But both you and Charlie sat here a year ago on Fox Business and really were quite concerned about what would happen with Europe.</p><p>Can the European banks -- or at least some of them -- are they so weak that they can somehow systematically negatively affect U.S. banks or our banking system here, Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: I don't think it will have that much effect on us. But I do think they still have a terrible problem.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren?</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, I agree with that. But, obviously, it would have some effect, but as I say, I do not think our fate is in the hands of European banks. And I'd worry very much if I were.</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, they're all very cheap.</p><p>Are -- are you -- would you (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>BUFFET: They're not -- they're not necessarily cheap.</p><p>CLAMAN: So you're not considering buying any?</p><p>BUFFET: I -- I -- there's not a European bank that I'm looking at.</p><p>CLAMAN: Not a European bank you're looking at. Internationally, by virtue of the fact that you're huge in insurance in this -- in this company, we cannot ignore the risk that is lurking out of Iran and its plans for nuclear dependence and -- and perhaps eventually dominance.</p><p>Are you writing -- are any of your insurance companies writing any policies related to that risk of Iran?</p><p>BUFFET: We exclude nuclear (INAUDIBLE). But that's been true generally for a long time. We exclude. And the nuclear risk is one that all the resources of the insurance industry can't handle. So it would be folly to write it, because people wouldn't get the protection they thought they were getting.</p><p>So nuclear is out of the question.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, are you concerned about what is happening in Iran and -- and do you see an eventual military tension between U.S.-Iran or -- or Iran and Israel, which would eventually, perhaps, draw in the United States?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, I don't think I know much about how it's going to work. And I am deeply suspicious of other people who claim to know what's going to happen exactly.</p><p>I think the future is often very hard to know.</p><p>CLAMAN: Trans -- we already talked about TransCanada.</p><p>Let's -- let's just quickly move on to your -- your lifestyle.</p><p>What newspapers or Web sites do you guys read every morning?</p><p>We have a lot of viewers who asked about this.</p><p>Bill, every morning, what do you reach for?</p><p>GATES: Well, I read \"New York Times,\" \"Wall Street Journal.\" \"The Economist\" is sort of my regular weekly fare.</p><p>BUFFET: He -- he can give you last week's by memory. He -- he knows every word.</p><p>GATES: No, it's great, it's great to have something you read on a regular basis. And they do special sections.</p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, what do you read?</p><p>MUNGER: Well, I agree with Bill. I think the best one publication I read is \"The Economist.\"..</p><p>CLAMAN: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MUNGER: -- which is interesting.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, well, I read that, but I -- I -- I read the local paper. I read the \"FT.\" I read \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I read \"The New York Times\" and I -- and I read \"USA Today.\"</p><p>CLAMAN: What do you watch on TV?</p><p>People wanted to know that, aside from sports, because I know you're a big sports fan.</p><p>BUFFET: Yes, well, I watch sports and I watch the Sunday news shows and -- and...</p><p>CLAMAN: Is there one you prefer?</p><p>BUFFET: No, I...</p><p>CLAMAN: Do you try to (INAUDIBLE) all...</p><p>BUFFET: I watch them all.</p><p>CLAMAN: You watch them all?</p><p>BUFFET: I watch them all. And I -- I have them taped and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CLAMAN: Oh, so you are technical?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: No, my wife does it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: And -- oh, what else do I watch here?</p><p>CLAMAN: I mean is there a show you think out there is clever?</p><p>GATES: Well, Comedy Ctrl is clever.</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, of course.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p>GATES: It's certainly, in a political season, there's a lot to make fun of.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Speaking of which, one of our viewers, one of our, actually, our viewer Twitterers had asked, \"Who do you think might be a good vice presidential candidate for Mitt Romney?\"</p><p>Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER: I haven't the faintest idea. I have some people I don't think should qualify.</p><p>CLAMAN: Who?</p><p>MUNGER: Oh, I'm not going to say.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET: I was hoping you'd ask him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MUNGER: It would be a long list.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, what do you think?</p><p>BUFFET: I think he shouldn't -- I think he would -- I think, largely, he will. I think he should pick somebody who he thinks would be best qualified to serve as president of the United States if anything happened to him. And -- and though people don't vote for the vice presidential candidate very -- to any great degree, so he can afford himself the luxury of doing that. And I think that he probably is the kind of person that will.</p><p>CLAMAN: Here's another Twitter person who wanted to know, \"What is the most significant motivator in your working life and how has that changed through the years?\"</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GATES: Well, I've kind of shifted from the innovations at Microsoft, which are great digital empowerment things, to helping the poorest. And so figures like how many less children died this year than last year, you know, pretty exciting to see that we're getting that number down.</p><p>You know, there's still a lot of science (ph), but it's -- it's aimed at the poorest now.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, your biggest motivator?</p><p>BUFFET: Oh, I -- just -- just running Berkshire is -- it's -- it's fun every day. And it's a never finished painting. And it's always got enough twists and turns in it to make it interesting.</p><p>So I know -- I know I'll have -- you know, I could -- I could be my age and retire and I could spend all week planning my haircut, you know. And this is a lot more fun.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: I want to thank all of you, <person><nameText>Bill Gates, </nameText></person>Charlie Munger and <person><nameText>Warren Buffet...</nameText></person></p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you .</p><p>CLAMAN: -- for joining us exclusively together. It's always fascinating to hear your perspectives on so many things.</p><p>Thank you for being on Fox Business.</p><p>BUFFET: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: Stuart, back to you in New York.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2012 CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.

And  as we look at how it's trading, it is up slightly, about .5 percent.</p><p>What do you think of that trade?</p><p>Do you think it would have been higher, lower?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, that doesn't change my conclusion, because of some half  a percent.  And, you know, I don't -- I have no idea whether Berkshire's  stock will go up or down in the next week or month or year.</p><p>But in relation to the businesses we own, it -- it's attractive.</p><p>CLAMAN:  One of the number one questions that came out this weekend --  it was interesting to me, because I've been coming six years and I have  never heard so many people ask why isn't Berkshire paying a dividend.  This  at a time when the largest percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies are now paying  dividends.  It's the first time in a long time that they are.</p><p>And then you have the fact that you own dividend paying stocks like  Coca-Cola, American Express, Intel, which just raised its dividend this  morning, by the way.</p><p>Why won't you pay a dividend to your shareholders?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, we think our shareholders, five years from now, will be  wealthier, counting what they would get from the reinvestment of the  dividend.  We think they would be -- they'll be wealthier if we hold onto  the money.</p><p>Now, we may be wrong in that, but historically we've been right.  And  if -- if we had paid a dividend over the years our shareholders would be  considerably poorer than they -- 10 years ago.  And as long as we -- I  think we will have the opportunity to invest dollars, to create more than a  dollar of present value, we'll retain the money.  And when we don't think  we can do that we'll either repurchase stock or pay dividends.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Is there no way you will ever pay a dividend?</p><p>BUFFET:  Oh, some day Berkshire will pay a dividend because it will  get so large that it can't use the money, or all of the money that it  earns, effectively.</p><p>But -- but we don't think we're at that point, although we're much  closer to that point, obviously, than we were 20 years ago.</p><p>CLAMAN:  I just mentioned that Coke pays a dividend.  Speaking of  Coke, the board is mulling a stock split.</p><p>Would you be for a stock split of Coca-Cola?</p><p>BUFFET:  I'm -- I'm totally neutral on that.  It's -- it's fine with  me if they do and it's fine with me if they don't.</p><p>But it -- it won't make any difference to us in terms of the value of  our Coca-Cola stock.</p><p>CLAMAN:  OK.  The succession plan was a very major focus here.  And  you said you'd be very clear about it.  You do finally have one person in  mind, with two back-ups.  I got you to tell us yesterday that it was a he.</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  But it is a male?</p><p>BUFFET:  It's a male.</p><p>CLAMAN:  It is a male.  OK.  I talked to some shareholders who said it  is becoming increasingly evident to them that it's Ajit Jain, who runs your  insurance business.  Keep going with the poker-faced one, because they say  the insurance business is increasingly becoming the -- one of the major  important factors, the most important factors for the future of Berkshire  and the profits that it brings in.</p><p>BUFFET:  Look, I would say this about the insurance business.  It's  been enormously important in getting us to where we are now.  It's still  enormously important.  It's actually not as important relative to the  entirety of Berkshire as it was 10 years ago.  We've added more businesses  away from insurance.</p><p>But insurance has driven us to where we are presently.</p><p>CLAMAN:  And the culture, you said he understands the culture of  Berkshire.</p><p>BUFFET:  Oh, all three of the candidates understand the culture very  well.</p><p>CLAMAN:  All right.  All three, but Ajit at the top?</p><p>BUFFET:  Oh, I -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET:  When -- when we put you on the board, you'll know.</p><p>CLAMAN:  OK.  All right.  Only the board knows.</p><p>You also said about your successor that under your new successor,  there will not be much of a derivatives book under Berkshire's umbrella.</p><p>Is that because you feel you really understand derivatives in a way  that nobody else does or that they've become dangerous for Berkshire?</p><p>BUFFET:  Oh, it -- it -- there isn't that much of a derivatives book  right now, if you look at the total value of Berkshire.  We've done very  little in new revenues.  But we have a few and one particularly good sized  position in terms of our equity put situation.  Only that's nothing  compared to what we have in equities overall.</p><p>So it's not a big deal now.  I would guess it would be a lesser deal.   And -- and partly that's because the rule -- in fact, in a big way that's  because the rules have been charged on derivatives.  We would not have the  derivatives position we have now if the rules had been the same five or 10  years ago in relation to posting of collateral.  We think that -- that  derivatives become much more dangerous for the individual enterprise when  they're required to post collateral.</p><p>CLAMAN:  OK.  You're 81 years old.  That's not any news to anybody.   But the fact that you were diagnosed with Stage 1 prostate cancer gave some  people a start.  It is obviously non-aggressive.  And you say it's a non- issue.  And you won't miss a single day of work due to your treatment,  which starts in, what, July?</p><p>BUFFET:  Mid-July.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Mid-July?</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes.  Um-hmm.</p><p>CLAMAN:  You won't miss any work at all?</p><p>BUFFET:  No.  No.  No.  Maybe -- maybe 15 minutes a day, something  like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  We can lose you for 15 minutes.</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, I wish -- I wish that we couldn't, but the truth is you  can't.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  But when you look at the -- the person who will eventually  take over, have you begun to apprentice your successor?</p><p>BUFFET:  My -- my successor doesn't need apprenticing.  If they needed  apprenticing, they wouldn't be the successor (INAUDIBLE) -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  They wouldn't be the one?</p><p>BUFFET:  No.  In fact, none of the three candidates would need  apprenticing.</p><p>CLAMAN:  In some of what you talked about, you talked about how great  some businesses are, but you talked about a big mistake.  Energy future -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CLAMAN:  -- from a Texas utility company.</p><p>BUFFET:  All mine do.</p><p>CLAMAN:  So sorry to bring it up.</p><p>BUFFET:  I did it by myself.</p><p>CLAMAN:  But these were tied very tightly to the price of natural gas.</p><p>BUFFET:  Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Which plummeted shortly after you bought it.</p><p>BUFFET:  Right.</p><p>CLAMAN:  How'd you get that so wrong?</p><p>BUFFET:  It was easy.  I'll probably be able to do it again.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET:  The -- it was -- it was -- it was just a case of not -- not  cranking that into my decision, weighting it with the appropriate  probability.</p><p>CLAMAN:  But 2010, you had to do a $2 billion write up -- write-down;  2011, another $398 million write-down.</p><p>How much -- </p><p>BUFFET:  (INAUDIBLE) that total.  But the total -- the total we put in  was about $2 billion and -- and I think it's been written out of maybe $400  million or $500 million.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Well, how much was it going to get?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, it can go all the way to zero.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Do you think it will?</p><p>BUFFET:  It -- it easily could.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Who -- who sold you on this idea, gold (INAUDIBLE) -- </p><p>BUFFET:  Me.  Me.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Really?</p><p>BUFFET:  No, no, no.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CLAMAN:  Goldman Sachs?</p><p>BUFFET:  No, I -- I have -- I have a real ability to pick these --  pick these out.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  OK.</p><p>One of the things you said that people sat on the edge of their seat,  because they want to know what you're buying, more newspapers.</p><p>BUFFET:  It's possible.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Jimmy Kimmel told a joke at the Washington correspondents  dinner.  He said, what's black, white and red all over?</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes, so I heard.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Nothing.</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yet you're buying now?</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  And you said specifically local newspapers.</p><p>How about \"The New York Times?\"</p><p>Is that local enough?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, I -- if a -- I would have to say, if I could buy \"The  New York Times,\" I might buy it personally.  I -- I don't know whether I'd  buy it for Berkshire.  But it's not for sale.</p><p>It's -- that's a very special case.</p><p>The newspapers that exist in communities where there's a strong sense  of community and where the newspapers respond to that strong sense of  community by -- by telling people a whole lot of things that they want to  know about their own community that they can't find some place else, those  newspapers will do OK.  They'll still be in decline over time.</p><p>CLAMAN:  But is it that you see that their value is relatively -- that  their price is relatively cheap to earnings?</p><p>BUFFET:  In some cases.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Um-hmm.</p><p>BUFFET:  In some cases.  But the earnings are not going to -- the  earnings are not going to go up.  I mean you're looking -- and -- and  they're probably going to go down in most -- in practically all cases.</p><p>So you have to buy them at a value, actually, that takes that into  account.</p><p>CLAMAN:  \"The Washington Post,\" you stepped down from the board.</p><p>BUFFET:  Right.</p><p>CLAMAN:  But you still fully own your position?</p><p>BUFFET:  We own every share we've ever owned.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Even though it's off its 52 week highs.</p><p>Do you feel it's doing pretty well?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, it -- I don't know whether they've published their  first quarter earnings yet or not.  But -- but they have problems in two of  their businesses, one in the education business and one in the newspaper.   And -- and that's been reflected, I think, in the price.</p><p>But those two businesses are -- well, the newspaper is far tougher  than it was five or 10 years ago.  And the education business is tougher  than it was about two years ago.</p><p>CLAMAN:  What's interesting to people, though, when you say that you  would buy more newspapers is at a time when everybody else is getting out,  it seems like you and Rupert Murdoch are the only people getting into  newspapers.</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes, right.  And he may not be quite as competitive for a  while, either.  So, no.  But they are not a -- it's not an industry whose  earnings are going to -- the earnings are going to just shrink in the  newspaper business, as are the revenues.  But not -- I don't necessarily  think they'll shrink at a dramatic rate where you have a strong feeling of  community and you have a newspaper that serves that community well.</p><p>CLAMAN:  \"The Washington Post\" reported Friday and their revenue -- </p><p>BUFFET:  Did they?</p><p>OK.</p><p>CLAMAN:  -- fell.</p><p>Yes, their revenue fell.  Well, speaking of Rupert Murdoch, because I  brought it up, hoc, is the head of News Corp, the parent of Fox Business.</p><p>BUFFET:  Sure.</p><p>CLAMAN:  You -- you made a little quip about our sister network, Fox.   One shareholder questioned whether your personal politics -- </p><p>BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  -- hurt shares of the company.  And your response was, \"I  really think someone making an investment decision based on the politics of  whether he agrees or not with the CEO, sounds to me like he ought to own  Fox.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET:  I'll leave it at that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  What -- what do you mean by that?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, I mean, I think it's silly to make a decision -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  Right.</p><p>BUFFET:  -- based on the politics of the CEO.  I -- I can't tell you  the politics of the CEOs of our major investments.  There may be one or two  that I would know about, but it is absolutely a zero factor in our making a  decision on a business.</p><p>CLAMAN:  I guess maybe people were really meaning that they're in  contradiction, they feel differently about the Buffett Rule than you do.</p><p>BUFFET:  Right.</p><p>CLAMAN:  You clarified in September to Fox Business News that what you  meant was the uber rich should pay a commensurate tax rate of about 30  percent, that a let -- a lot of the rest of Americans are paying.</p><p>BUFFET:  Right.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yet the Buffet -- yet the Obama administration kind of took  it in a different way and is now promoting it for people who make a million  dollars or more.</p><p>Have you talked to the president about how he's split from what you  really intended?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, that isn't really different than what I intended.  I  mean, I might tweak it a little bit in one direction or another.  But I was  talking about the people making a million or more.</p><p>Now I would probably have a different break, also, for the people  making $10 million or more.</p><p>But the -- Senator Whitehouse is the one that put the bill in.  And I  wrote him a letter immediately after he did so that in -- I -- I basically  approve of his bill.  If I were writing the bill, I'd write it a little --  slightly different, but so would everybody else.</p><p>But I -- I think it -- it gets at the -- it gets at the point that 131  out of 400 of the highest incomes in the country, those 400 incomes average  $270 million each.  That's not bad.  That's, you know, almost three  quarters of a million dollars a day.  And -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  We'd take it.</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes.  And a -- a third of those people paid less than a 15  percent rate, combined payroll and income tax.</p><p>And I -- I think -- I think that's wrong and I think it -- and in an  economy where we're going to ask for shared sacrifice of people, that we  ought to go after the (INAUDIBLE).  It doesn't solve the revenue problem.</p><p>But I think that people want a code that has at least that much  fairness in it.</p><p>CLAMAN:  But, Warren, if you feel so strongly about that, why not take  a bigger salary than you always have?</p><p>You've always opted to take your income in cash -- in -- in Berkshire  stock versus cash.</p><p>Yet if you took a bigger salary instead, you could pay that 30 percent  rate.</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Why not have done it that way?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, the company would get a deduction, too.  So the  government would be -- would be worse off rather than wise (ph), actually,  because the company would get a 35 percent deduction if they paid it to me.</p><p>So it's -- it -- it wouldn't change the revenue, it would just take  some money from the shareholders.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Here's what -- what I heard from some other people, too, is  they said, you know, when you're donating most of your -- your money to the  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is philanthropic and wonderful and  yet that will keep it from being taxed.</p><p>And some would say, why not then let it be taxed, because it --  wouldn't it be helpful to give it as revenue to the government?</p><p>BUFFET:  That would be an alternative.  But I -- I think that we will  probably be able to accomplish a lot more around the world with that money  going to the foundation.</p><p>But it -- it's a wonderful tax dodge.  I urge all you -- all the  viewers if they -- if they want to pay less tax, they should give away more  money.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Investments -- what other countries are you investing in?</p><p>You mentioned an acquisition in the Netherlands.</p><p>But what other countries' companies are starting to look good to you?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, we don't really look by country.  That -- that company  in the Netherlands was for sale.  I mean the owners of it decided to sell  it a month or so ago and -- and we ended up buying it last week.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Right.</p><p>BUFFET:  But we don't look much by country.  It -- we -- we really  look for businesses we understand, with some kind of competitive advantage  and good management and a price that makes sense.</p><p>And if we find that -- we found, you know, the most wonderful of all  in Israel six or seven years ago.  And we've -- we can find them here in  the United States, usually.</p><p>CLAMAN:  And that was ISCAR?</p><p>BUFFET:  Absolutely.</p><p>CLAMAN:  You said that there was a $22 billion deal that you missed by  that much.  You couldn't get that deal done.  You wouldn't say what sector  it was in.</p><p>Can you say what country it was in?</p><p>BUFFET:  No, it was -- but it was on this planet.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  I tried.</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, you narrowed it down.</p><p>CLAMAN:  How does Brazil look for investment right now?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, I -- I -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  See anything you like in Brazil?</p><p>BUFFET:  I -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  How about that?</p><p>BUFFET:  Well, I don't know that much about specific -- (INAUDIBLE).   I mean, if we found something that was interesting in Brazil, some business  I understood, it was large, the price was right.  The management was right,  we'd buy it in a second.</p><p>CLAMAN:  You have bought some European stocks recently.</p><p>BUFFET:  That is true.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Which ones?</p><p>I mean it's going to come out in an SEC filing eventually, won't it?</p><p>BUFFET:  No, actually, we don't have to report the foreign stocks.</p><p>CLAMAN:  You don't have to report it?</p><p>BUFFET:  No.</p><p>CLAMAN:  So you won't say?</p><p>BUFFET:  No, that's true.</p><p>CLAMAN:  OK.  But would you say, 10, 11, 12 coun -- companies?</p><p>BUFFET:  It was about -- I think it was more like nine.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Nine?</p><p>BUFFET:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CLAMAN:  This morning, folks, when Warren Buffet arrived here at our  shoot, he quickly went upstairs to put in stock orders.</p><p>European stock orders?</p><p>BUFFET:  Not today.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Not today.</p><p>So at -- U.S. equities?</p><p>BUFFET:  That's what's left, yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET:  Because I did say it was on this planet, yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  U.S. equities look cheap then at this point, with the markets  the way they are today?</p><p>BUFFET:  Some do.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Some do.</p><p>BUFFET:  Some do, sure.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Let's talk about the news of the weekend, as well.  Nicolas  Sarkozy is out in France.</p><p>BUFFET:  He's out.  Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  And Francois Hollande, who is, of course, a Socialist, is in.</p><p>This is disconcerting to a lot of people who wonder, will we see  capital flight away from France, the likes of what we saw when Francois  Mitterand, who was also a Socialist, was elected years ago.</p><p>Will people take their money out of France?</p><p>Do you predict that or could you see that?</p><p>BUFFET:  I -- I don't know the answer to that.  I -- I would not be  enthused if I had a Socialist win anyplace.  But -- but the -- I think the  problems facing Europe transcend, almost, you know, those in any specific  country.  I mean they have to work out the rules under which 17 countries  can really work together.  When they lock themselves into a monetary unit.   And they haven't locked themselves in in a number of other ways.</p><p>So, I think overall what happens in Europe is probably maybe affected by  the leaders in given countries, but it's going to be much more important  than any specific election.</p><p>CLAMAN: You just said locked into a specific currency.  Was the euro idea a  mistake?  </p><p>BUFFETT: Getting out of it would be an enormous problem, too, but I  think maybe it was a mistake.  As it was done.  In fact, I can say it was a  mistake as it was done.  Now the question is whether you can modify the  original concept in some way that makes this more workable than it is  proving to be.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Well, as it morphs and changes, Greece has parliamentary elections  and neo-Nazis were elected to the parliament.  Is it just a matter of time  before Greece either leaves or gets jettisoned from the euro zone?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  I don't know about - I think it's a matter of time until  they come up with a better solution than the present structure or they  abandon it entirely. Who knows which it will happen?</p><p>CLAMAN: Forty-seven years later from you starting your company, you finally  invested in a technology stock or two.  IBM and Intel --  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Yes, I didn't - I didn't do the Intel.</p><p>CLAMAN: You didn't do the Intel. You did the IMB.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Yes. </p><p>CLAMAN:  Who did the Intel?</p><p>BUFFETT: Yes, it would have been Todd because he was the only one - </p><p>CLAMAN:  OK.  Todd did -- Todd Holmes, who is one of your new investment  managers.  It was his idea. But you never bought Microsoft.  Did you hear  from your board member Bill Gates about that?  </p><p>BUFFETT: I can't buy -- I can't buy Microsoft.  If we bought  Microsoft, for one thing, our buying days take place month after month  after month.  And if something happened that was favorable at Microsoft,  people would have said I had insider information.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Well, actually, let's bring in Bill Gates right now, who founded  Microsoft - </p><p>BUFFETT:  Maybe he'll give me some insider information!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFETT:  Now's the time. </p><p>CLAMAN: What's inside information at Microsoft (ph)? </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  When you heard that he finally bought a technology stock and IBM  and Intel, did you think those were pretty good ideas?  </p><p>BILL GATES, FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: Well, I think it is great that Todd  gets the entire universe to exercise his great thinking.  And he has done a  good job there.  </p><p>A lot of technology companies, you can't see where they will be in 10 years  or 20 years.  IBM has enough service revenue that they may be somewhat of  an exception to that. But most tech stocks, you know, play a very high- variance game, which makes it I think the most interesting in the street in  the world.  But not for an investor who wants any degree of downside  protection.  </p><p>BUFFETT: He told me that when I met him in 1991, too.  </p><p>And what point should be made about Todd. Todd can change his positions  far, far easier than I can.  So, Todd is working with sums.  If he decides  to move onto something else, he can - he can do that.  I can't do that with  the big positions that we take.  So, we are really locked in more than he  would be.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, you just said that with many tech stocks, you can't see where  they will be in ten to 20 years.  Can you see, Warren, where Facebook would  be in 10 to 20 years?  </p><p>BUFFETT: No, no I can't.  I mean, it is an enormously impressive  accomplishment.   And my guess is it has a big future of some sort.  But I have no idea.  I  didn't even know what it was six or seven years ago.  And I'm still not on  it, so - </p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, are you on Facebook?  </p><p>GATES: Sure. </p><p>CLAMAN: You are on Twitter as well.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  He's in a different world. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  Always have been.  In fact, I  remember when you were saying Bill  had to teach you how to just simply click on the blue E for Explorer.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  He's had his problems with me. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GATES:  Well, Warren's a big tech user (ph) if you count online  bridge.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  That's right. </p><p>GATES:  That takes him up into the top one percent in terms of Internet  addicts.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  I'm like a guy who's (INAUDIBLE) to turn on the switch.  And  then, as far as I'm concerned, there's some guy inside that thing that's  playing - (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: Listen, let's talk about Facebook.  It's huge news today.  The  beginning of the road show.  </p><p>Bill, you have been dealing with investors and analysts for years and banks  for years and years.  Would you tell Mark Zuckerberg -- because there is  question as to whether he will attend the road show.  Would you say, you  know, you really should get out there and do it?  </p><p>GATES:  I know when Microsoft had to do its road show, I minimized the  amount of time.  I think I offered three days, I told them no limousines.   I took a book about biology.  I was reading during the breaks.  I tried not  to have it take too much time away from the business.  You know, so, you've  got to focus on what is important in making sure your profit friend (ph)  users is great -- as number one</p><p>BUFFETT:  This is a guy that negotiated down with his mother  (INAUDIBLE) down to an hour over the time he was willing to spend with me. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>GATES:  Well, I didn't know what I was in for.  I thought -- </p><p>CLAMAN: Didn't want to spend more than an hour with Buffett?  Your mom said  meet the guy, and --</p><p>GATES:  Before Warren and I met, I wasn't sure we had that much to  talk about.  Now, I was 100 percent wrong about that, but my mom made me  say I would stay a few hours at this event that Kay, Graham and Warren were  at.  In fact, I stayed the whole day, and I was disappointed when Warren  was leaving because talking about business and the dynamics of how things  were changing I found somebody I'm part of -- one of the most interesting  parts of my life.  A lifelong conversation. </p><p>BUFFETT:  His mom was prying us apart at the end. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: What would you advise Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook to attend that  road show?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  I wouldn't worry too much.  I mean - you know, that offering  was going to be big.  I'm not saying the stock is going to go, but it is  going to get all the attention in the world.  And people know what Facebook  is.  I mean, it's not a mystery that has to be explained.</p><p>CLAMAN: Can it --</p><p>BUFFETT:  Except to me!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  If -- if it does have $100 billion valuation or whatever the crazy  numbers are out there, can it sustain that? What does it need to do to  sustain that?  What does it need to do to sustain that, Bill?</p><p>GATES: Well, it just needs to have advertising revenue that makes that  earnings dream properly discounted be greater than $100 billion. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GATES:  And -</p><p>CLAMAN:  Simple! </p><p>GATES: It's right there in \"The Intelligent Investor\"!</p><p>You know, they have a lot of traffic.  And the ability to monetize that  traffic over time will be fascinating to see if they can push up and go  beyond the earnings stream you need for that or not.  But it is one  phenomenally impressive company.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, everybody is always talking about the succession plan.  And  you know, you went through this very  issue back when you decided to leave  the CEO position at Microsoft.  The stock has done really well lately, and  Windows 8 is about to blast onto the scene.  And I hear from -- Recover  Silicon Valley heavily at Fox Business.  And I hear from them that once  Windows 8 gets into the ultra-books and it becomes  a touch screen, you  could very well take on the Mac Air and the MacBook.  </p><p>Is that what Microsoft should be aiming for, and do you think it could  happen with Ultra Books?  </p><p>GATES:  Well, it is very exciting that Windows 8 is coming out.  It's  a very big deal for the company.  Steve and the whole team are doing a  great job there.  It creates a new category of machines that are sort of --  have the good things about tablets and the good things about PCs.  And so,  it's going to evolve these digital tools. </p><p>You know, people right now like the tablet, but it's hard to - </p><p>CLAMAN:  Type on. </p><p>GATES:  -- to give input.  You don't have Microsoft Office on there.  And  so, with our hardware partners, there's a lot of neat stuff that comes out  later year.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, what kind of computer do you use?  </p><p>BUFFETT: I think it's an HP that the guys at the furniture market (ph)  sent over.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Well, what do you use, Bill?</p><p>GATES:  Well, I have a Samsung tablet is my primary machine, but I  have Dell machines and a variety.  I'm always getting the latest and  greatest. </p><p>CLAMAN: So, no iPad for you.</p><p>GATES:  No, no, -- I said I am using the latest and greatest.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFETT:  Bill has -- they have a chimpanzee up there in Seattle, and  then they have me and then they have us both test these new things.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And, actually, I am more reliable than the chimpanzee.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Do you have an iPad, Warren?</p><p>BUFFETT:  No.  </p><p>CLAMAN: No.  So, you're not going for the tablet at this point.  </p><p>Bill, let's just say the Samsung Galaxy has gone traction, but not nearly  as much as the iPad has.  Rim couldn't come out with a tablet that smacked  it down nor hp.  </p><p>What company out there has the special something that can take on that iPad  in your opinion?  </p><p>GATES:  Well, the tablets base is going to grow, but you really want  something where you either have a pen or keyboard and you have your  productivity applications.  So, you want the best of both worlds, and that  is what Microsoft and others are pushing for. </p><p>I think this fall, people will understand that there is room for big  improvement there.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Microsoft just made a pretty big deal, about $300 million with  Barnes &amp; Noble.  Will eventually that morph into a deal to make some type  of tablet or a Kindle with Microsoft abilities to jack it up?  </p><p>GATES:  Well, the idea is they are going to take their reading  experience and books and make them look super good on these new devices.   And so, on these devices, you want to run Office where you create  documents.  But you want to consume books in new ways, consume videos in  new ways.  And so, it's that merger and having their team do innovative  work is what made that investment a smart idea.</p><p>CLAMAN: Warren, you said this weekend you would not buy Apple.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Well, I said I wouldn't know enough to buy Apple.  Yes.  But  no, I'm not going to buy anything I don't feel I can have a reasonable fix  on what they will look like in five or ten years.  And I certainly didn't  have a reasonable fix - I wish I had -- ten years ago on Apple but I don't  have one now.  </p><p>I think it's an amazing company.  But there are lots of businesses I don't  understand.</p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, tech companies have gotten so desperate to have the latest  and greatest technology that they are trying to buy in in patents.  They're  trying to buy chunks of patents, you know, with the Motorola mobility  issue.  Today, a judge is going to consider, I believe, that Microsoft's  complaint that Motorola is charging for what really should be basic  technology patents.  </p><p>Have the patent wars gotten a little out of hand?  </p><p>GATES:  No, I think the idea that invention is valuable has become  more obvious.  It was always true in the drug industry that the whole  industry, these miracle medicine exists, because patents were protecting  that invention.  </p><p>And fortunately, we are seeing more invention in many areas.  The IT sector  has got a lot, but you know, if you come up with a renewable energy design,  that is going to be protected by a patent.  </p><p>So, patents are important.  There are immensely complex, and sometimes when  people look at it either because of the complexity of the system because  they haven't looked into it, it seems strange to them. But the idea that  invention has value - I think that  is an idea that is more and more  important over time.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Warren?</p><p>BUFFETT:  Oh, I agree.  I just don't know how to invent anything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN: There have been a couple of corporate scandals.  Among them, Apple  and Foxconn.  Foxconn is one of the manufacturers of components of Apple's  products.  They were accused of mistreating their workers and in some cases  underpaying them. </p><p>Did Apple handle that right?  Would you care if you found out that one of  your companies under the Berkshire umbrella was buying a lot of stuff from  people who mistreated their workers?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Sure, and we hope that all our companies are looking at all kinds  of things including that.  But f you have a very, very large company  something is going to go wrong.  And right now I can tell you with 270,000  employees at Berkshire, someone is doing something they shouldn't.   I just  hope it is small, I hope we find out about it, and then I hope whoever is  in charge does something about it properly but you cannot run a large army  or a large government bureau or large church without things going wrong  from time to time.  It's going to happen.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  It is going to happen but this Foxconn issue was out there.  Wired  Magazine a year and a half ago had a huge front-page story about it, Bill.   I'm just wondering -- had that ever happened to you at Microsoft?  Would  you look at that and say Apple really should have dealt with that much more  quickly?  </p><p>GATES:  I think American companies overall are improving labor conditions  when they're involved in whether it is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or  really looking down the supply chain at trying to make sure labor  conditions are okay, I think American business has had a positive effect.   I don't know specifics of the Apple case but I know they are not going to  try to take shortcuts in that way.  They are certainly very focused on  fixing any problems at this point.  </p><p>CLAMAN: You mentioned the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  That's pretty  controversial with Wal-Mart lately and a lot of people saying hey, that is  how you get business done in Mexico.  What is your response to that?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  My responses is that we have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  It  may very well be that's the way business is done in Mexico but you'd better  not do it if you are an American corporation.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Maybe the crime was less important than the cover-up.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  It's always a problem.  I mean, I know something's being done  that's wrong at Berkshire, I can't tell what it is and --</p><p>CLAMAN:  But Warren, if somebody came to you and you knew about it, like  the Wal-Mart top executives did, would you say \"don't be so aggressive on  that?\" </p><p>BUFFETT:  No, but I think almost all CEOs when they know the facts - - it  certainly seems quite clear there was bribery in all of that.  Exactly what  happened after that, I'm not sure about, but I would think there are very  few American CEOs that if they find out about some problems, they're going  to try to figure out something to do and something about them promptly.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Bill, earlier we were talking with Warren about how he wants to  buy more newspapers.  </p><p>GATES:  He's not going to compete with me.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  You are not going to buy newspapers?  Because he got the idea to  buy railroads back in 2006 from you.  You were already in a Canadian  railroad.  </p><p>GATES:  No, Warren's has been playing with railroads since he was a boy.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  That's right.  </p><p>GATES:  I can hardly take credit for introducing him to that whole sector  of the economy.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  I'm repeating what he told me.  </p><p>GATES:  He's very generous.  We both made good money.  We're happy railroad  investors.  </p><p>CLAMAN: You both -- and I knew this about Warren, but I didn't know you  used to be a newspaper delivery boy.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Absolutely.  I was far better than Warren.  It's really one of  those things that needs more coverage.  </p><p>[laughter] </p><p>BUFFETT:  I was there yesterday, he didn't show up.  </p><p>[laughter] </p><p>CLAMAN: We got video of it.  There was a newspaper throwing contest where  we all tossed Omaha World Heralds to the porch of a Clayton home.  </p><p>GATES:  Exactly.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  I was stunned to see, here's Warren, you made it right to the  porch, and then Bill exactly in the same position, that little boy is one  of your grandsons.  </p><p>GATES:  He won that.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  I own the house and the newspaper, I better be close enough.  </p><p>[laughter] </p><p>GATES:  When it came to ping-pong, I would say I was a little better.   We're 1 to 1 for the weekend.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  That's right.  </p><p>[CROSSTALK]</p><p>CLAMAN:  2 on 1.  Then you brought up the gigantic paddle.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  That didn't work either.  [laughter] </p><p>CLAMAN:  In the past you've done a lot of things.  You've danced with the  Nebraska cheerleaders.  You've ridden a bull.  That must have been  incredible.  Back then when you were doing it, you were in your 70s.  They  are both looking at the monitor.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Absolutely.  I look as bad as I look there as I do here.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Charlie, your vice chairman, never participates in sitting on the  bull or throwing the newspapers, why not?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  He's the thinker in the group.  </p><p>[laughter] </p><p>CLAMAN:  In fact here he is, Charlie Munger, the vice chair of Berkshire  Hathaway, joining us now.  Good morning Charlie.  Welcome to the party  here.  </p><p>CHARLIE MUNGER, VICE CHAIR, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY:  Thank you.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Charlies, there was so much focus this weekend on Warren's health  and his succession plan and how much longer Warren will be running the  company.  Let's turn it to you, how much longer will you be up on stage  with Warren for these annual shareholder meetings?  </p><p>MUNGER:  I serve a very important function because people look at me and  think they will get another seven years out of Warren.  I don't think he's  anxious to get rid of me.</p><p>[laughter] </p><p>BUFFETT:  I'm there to show there's some guy older than me in American  business.  Makes me look very good when I'm up there.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  How much longer will you participate?  Somebody said is this  Charlie's last year?  </p><p>MUNGER:  No.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Well, I hope not.  </p><p>CLAMAN: You have every plan to remain on the stage at these meetings?  </p><p>MUNGER:  I'm not going to sit up there drooling.  But I plan to be there.   If the only way to get up is to drool, then I'll drool.</p><p>CLAMAN:  You were as feisty as ever.  One comment you made got a round of  applause from the audience that was on the mortgage and lending bubble.   And you said this -- this is stuff you have said over the past couple of  years, but you've never phrased it like this before, you said it was wrong  not to stamp down on felony and folly of all that irresponsible lending,  quote I often say \"Alan Greenspan overdosed on Ayn Rand.\"  Meaning the  whole free market hands-off approach was a total disaster?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Certainly.  Most of these have limits.  In other words, an ax  murderer is not a good thing because it happens in a free market.  There's  a limit to when the free market is -- [inaudible] a free market with that  kind of fraud and folly it is not wise to allow it.  We were disgraceful to  sit there and let Canada be sensible while we went crazy.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  I would say this in, in fairness to Alan Greenspan and Charlie  has made this point that he has said that he's sort of overestimated --  overestimated the ability of the free market to natural operations to rein  in -- all the self-interest that -- </p><p>MUNGER:  Yes, Alan Greenspan is the only person who has apologized.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Who else should apologize?  </p><p>MUNGER:  There's a big list, practically everybody.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Banks, U.S. banks?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Oh, my God, yes.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Dodd Frank, now we have that, but the last numbers I looked at, it  is 850 pages long.  The Volcker Rule alone breaks down to 380 plus  questions and those have more than 1400 sub-questions.  Will that be the  thing that prevents us from dealing with this type of disaster again?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Well, it was certainly a step in the right direction.  If I had  the power, I would have made the Volcker act look like a non-restraint.  I  would have done much more.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  So you think that preventing banks from investing in the  proprietary trading issue?  They are all complaining, Charlie, that that's  ruining their ability to do well and do well for shareholders.  </p><p>MUNGER:  Well, that's natural when people were making a lot of money out of  something to not want to be forced out of it.  These banks ought to only be  open on Christmas.  They ought to have a fairly restricted repertoire.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Well, we the taxpayers bailed out a lot of them, including AIG.   In the news today is the Treasury Department will try and sell off more  taxpayer holdings of AIG.  Do you think the bailout of AIG was something we  had to do?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Probably.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Do you think the taxpayer, Warren, will see a profit on that?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Yes, the way it is going, they will show a profit, yes.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, do you think so?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Barely.  </p><p>[laughter] </p><p>BUFFETT:  He hated to say that.  </p><p>CLAMAN: There's belief, trying to jump-start the economy, that if you get  rid of onerous regulation -- not all regulation, but onerous regulation --  that businesses will invest more and grow more.  You guys own businesses,  Lubrizol which is heavily regulated I'm sure, Burlington Northern the  railroad heavily regulated.  The regulations -- if the regulations were  diluted just a bit, would you invest more, that would mean more hiring and  the economy would come back?  </p><p>MUNGER:  The answer is no.  Sure there are regulations that don't make any  sense out there and there always will be.  It is a very big complicated  economy, but we are dying to make investments and we invested more money  last year than we ever have in the history of Berkshire and we'll break  that record again this year. American corporations have lots and lots and  lots of liquidity, and where they see demand, they're going to invest in  facilities that meet that demand.  </p><p>CLAMAN: No matter what?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, in your high-tech field, what regulation do you think -- he  just talked about regulations that should be banished but what regulation  holds you back that you really feel shouldn't be there?  </p><p>GATES:  I think the closest thing to that is whether or not an engineer who  is trained in the United States but is a foreign citizen, it should be easy  for them and they should be allowed to be a taxpayer here or they should be  forced to go back and the jobs around them created in another country.  So  the high-tech, high-skills immigration issue is one that definitely affects  the job picture.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Senator John Kerry has the Startup Visa Act which would if there's  a foreigner give them a green card if they have enough investment, they  start a business, and they would hire some people, is that something,  Charlie, you think is a good idea?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Yes, but I think Bill's idea is a much bigger idea.  I think we're  out of our minds to send brilliant people back when they want to stay here.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  I feel stronger about that than I used to.  I mean it is crazy.  </p><p>MUNGER:  -- could be stronger.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  It just makes no sense.  Bill gave you the best answer you could  have on it.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Why then do we have it, we make it so difficult with the H1B visa,  which is the issue, would you say if you had the opportunity, Bill, to have  the president's ear on that issue, surely he knows?  </p><p>GATES:  There are various things that have not gotten through the Congress,  you know, people want to make sure you're doing your best to hire American  workers, and so there's a legitimate concern there.  But there's a way to  be more liberal on this without at all substituting for domestic labor --  labor that you might have used.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  You have a lot of people that are worried about -- they marry the  issue of the border with Mexico with brilliant engineers who are coming  from India and China.  Is there a way to separate that?  Would it be a  better idea, Charlie?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Of course it would be a better idea, of course it should be done.   This is a competitive world, you do not want to send the brains back.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  What bill is talking about would increase employment in the  United States.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Brains.  You bought some brains in China, Charlie.  BYD, the  electric car company, it is fun to see you two disagree on stage.  You  disagreed about the VAT tax.  Charlie thinks we should have a VAT tax.   Later, Warren, you told me you didn't think that was a good idea.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Right.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Going to electric vehicles, you feel, Charlie, that we should be  giving government incentives and real carrots to inspire people to drive  more electric vehicles; correct?  </p><p>MUNGER:  We already do.  I have a niece and her husband who commute in  Washington, D.C. and because they ride in a Prius, they get to use the fast  lane.  That's a huge incentive.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  There's an incentive.  </p><p>MUNGER:  There is a lot of incentive and there should be.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Should it be, Warren, at the expense because the money has to come  from somewhere, at big oil, which is well-established and is getting a lot  of tax breaks?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Charlie is the expert on this subject.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Should we sort of lessen what we have given to the oil companies  over the years and switch it over to electric vehicles?  </p><p>MUNGER:  I don't think the big problem of America is the oil companies have  been favored too much.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  You don't think that's a problem?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Yes, by and large.  Exxon is a technical meritocracy which is a  very creditable place.  In other words, if more of America ran like Exxon,  it would be a better country.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Let's get to Keystone, then.  The Keystone pipeline was rejected  initially.  Now the new proposal from Transcanada is going.  You are both  Nebraska residents -- you live in California now, Charlie, but you're from  Nebraska.  You are also business people.  The new route and when we get  more details we will know but would you be for the Keystone pipeline if it  doesn't threaten the aquifer and it doesn't threaten the areas that are  culturally sensitive and environmentally sensitive?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  I'm not an expert, but it generally sounds like it makes a lot of  sense to me.  Awful lot of pipelines running through the United States.   Net, they have certainly been a huge plus for the country.  I don't know  all the details on it, but based on what I know, I would say that it makes  sense.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Were you then disappointed when Keystone was rejected, it could  mean so many jobs?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  I don't think that issue is done with yet.  The jobs aspect of it  is not the big aspect.  The real question is what it will do for the  country over many years and what the drawbacks are.  But you can build  anything that will create jobs.  That doesn't mean it is a good idea.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Bill, you are invested in alternative energy and some of it a  certain subsector of nuclear, but looking at natural gas, wow, it is so  unbelievably inexpensive now and cleaner than oil, do you think this  country should be converting to nat gas burning cars and trucks?  </p><p>GATES:  Well, natural gas, unfortunately, the energy density unless you  take it to a very low temperature is much lower, so there's a lot of  innovators looking at how can we do that better.  There are ways of  converting natural gas to liquids, but those factories are very expensive  so people are going to try to innovate.  There's such good news that we  have inexpensive natural gas.  It is the most natural that we get the  benefit of that in the power generation sector as we're turning over our  power plants, but because the price is so attractive on an equivalent  energy basis there will be innovations that move it into parts of the  transport sector, that's very exciting.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Charlie, you said on stage this weekend we should not look for  energy independence, we should use up the bad guys' energy -- </p><p>MUNGER:  Or the good guys, like Canada.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Or the good guys but conserve our own.  </p><p>MUNGER:  Right.  That to me is an obvious conclusion considering how  precious this stuff is going to get.  Trying to use our whole supply, our  reserves as fast as possible is insane.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  But you could arguably stick it to certain Arab nations who  despise the United States and they despise Israel and make life difficult  for everybody by completely turning off the spigot and not use their oil  and then you hit them financially, no? </p><p>MUNGER:  My desire to do spiteful things to the Arab nations is zero.  As  long as they want to sell their oil, I'm delighted to see us buy it rather  than use our own.  I think that adults suffer now to be better off later.   When you save your own oil, and buy the other fellows', that's what you're  doing.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  You drove an electric car, you said the most recent BYD, do you  own an electric car?  </p><p>MUNGER:  No.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  What do you drive, Charlie?  </p><p>MUNGER:  A Mercedes.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  What do you drive, Warren?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Cadillac.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Bill, what car do you usually use?  </p><p>GATES:  I have a Mercedes.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Two Mercedes.  Mercedes is buying advertising right now on Fox  Business, so thank you very much, we hope.  </p><p>[laughter] </p><p>CLAMAN:  You both took swipes at business school this weekend which I  thought was interesting.  You don't think they are teaching the right  things.  Warren, you went to business school.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Apparently.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Columbia.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  And I had a fabulous teacher.  I went there because -- two  fabulous teachers.  And I went there because two people that I really  wanted to sit at their feet and I got a chance to do that.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  And you're generous to business schools.  You host more than 40 of  them every year -- </p><p>BUFFETT:  48.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  48, let them come here and take questions.  That's certainly  wonderful.  What is it that business schools are doing wrong?  </p><p>BUFFETT:  Well, in the investment field I thought that over the last 40 or  so years that most -- a great many business schools were teaching nonsense.   But that doesn't mean they were in other aspects of other majors within the  business schools.  </p><p>CLAMAN: Bill, Charlie, would either of you make a decision to hire somebody  based on whether the candidate had gone to business school?  Bill?  </p><p>GATES:  Well, if they are a young person, that's a recent part of their  resume, so it might give them some valuable skills.  I don't think anybody  is saying that business school doesn't have some merit to it.  It's just  the -- how you do investment valuation as they have tried to apply  mathematical techniques, they have claimed more than they should for these  techniques.  </p><p>BUFFETT:  I hired a young woman a couple years ago out of business school,  and she would have been very good naturally, but I'm sure she was better  because she'd gone to business school, but I didn't hire her for what she  learned about investments in the business school.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Charlie?  </p><p>MUNGER:  I said I thought the business schools were improving, which I  think is true, including in the investment field, but they have a lot of  room for it.  </p><p>CLAMAN: The Buffett rule, that's getting so much attention.  Charlie, what  did you think when Warren pushed for the Buffett rule and has been quite  vocal about it?  </p><p>MUNGER:  Well, it's caused me some lack of popularity at my country club,  and I'm willing to bear it in order to participate in Berkshire.  I think  it's fine if the rich people pay more taxes.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Warren, you know -- </p><p>BUFFETT:  I think it's fine if he pays more taxes too. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  Do you see the other side of it that, oh, the wealthy are the ones  who are paying the biggest amount of taxes and that a large percentage of  people don't pay any taxes aside from sales taxes, etcetera?  That whole  argument. </p><p>BUFFETT: Well the etcetera is payroll taxes. </p><p>CLAMAN: Yes. </p><p>BUFFETT: Payroll taxes are $800 billion of a $2.3 trillion dono -- revenue  thing.  So payroll taxes are a huge element of our revenue base.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER:  Well, I don't like the idea that nobody but the rich should  pay taxes, because the country can't work on taxes from the rich people.   It won't produce enough.  And it would have terrible economic effects.</p><p>So I don't like this politics of envy style of -- of discourse.</p><p>But I think the rich people should cheerfully pay more taxes.</p><p>CLAMAN:  We already talked to Warren about the developments in Europe  this morning, with France turning socialist with Francois Hollande, who's  the Socialist president.  The U.S. banks, Warren, you said were in a far,  far better position.  But both you and Charlie sat here a year ago on Fox  Business and really were quite concerned about what would happen with  Europe.</p><p>Can the European banks -- or at least some of them -- are they so weak  that they can somehow systematically negatively affect U.S. banks or our  banking system here, Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER:  I don't think it will have that much effect on us.  But I do  think they still have a terrible problem.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Warren?</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes, I agree with that.  But, obviously, it would have some  effect, but as I say, I do not think our fate is in the hands of European  banks.  And I'd worry very much if I were.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Well, they're all very cheap.</p><p>Are -- are you -- would you (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>BUFFET:  They're not -- they're not necessarily cheap.</p><p>CLAMAN:  So you're not considering buying any?</p><p>BUFFET:  I -- I -- there's not a European bank that I'm looking at.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Not a European bank you're looking at.  Internationally, by  virtue of the fact that you're huge in insurance in this -- in this  company, we cannot ignore the risk that is lurking out of Iran and its  plans for nuclear dependence and -- and perhaps eventually dominance.</p><p>Are you writing -- are any of your insurance companies writing any  policies related to that risk of Iran?</p><p>BUFFET:  We exclude nuclear (INAUDIBLE).  But that's been true  generally for a long time.  We exclude.  And the nuclear risk is one that  all the resources of the insurance industry can't handle.  So it would be  folly to write it, because people wouldn't get the protection they thought  they were getting.</p><p>So nuclear is out of the question.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Charlie, are you concerned about what is happening in Iran  and -- and do you see an eventual military tension between U.S.-Iran or --  or Iran and Israel, which would eventually, perhaps, draw in the United  States?</p><p>MUNGER:  Well, I don't think I know much about how it's going to work.   And I am deeply suspicious of other people who claim to know what's going  to happen exactly.</p><p>I think the future is often very hard to know.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Trans -- we already talked about TransCanada.</p><p>Let's -- let's just quickly move on to your -- your lifestyle.</p><p>What newspapers or Web sites do you guys read every morning?</p><p>We have a lot of viewers who asked about this.</p><p>Bill, every morning, what do you reach for?</p><p>GATES:  Well, I read \"New York Times,\" \"Wall Street Journal.\" \"The  Economist\" is sort of my regular weekly fare.</p><p>BUFFET:  He -- he can give you last week's by memory.  He -- he knows  every word.</p><p>GATES:  No, it's great, it's great to have something you read on a  regular basis.  And they do special sections.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Charlie, what do you read?</p><p>MUNGER:  Well, I agree with Bill.  I think the best one publication I  read is \"The Economist.\"..</p><p>CLAMAN:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MUNGER:  -- which is interesting.</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes, well, I read that, but I -- I -- I read the local paper.   I read the \"FT.\" I read \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I read \"The New York  Times\" and I -- and I read \"USA Today.\"</p><p>CLAMAN:  What do you watch on TV?</p><p>People wanted to know that, aside from sports, because I know you're a  big sports fan.</p><p>BUFFET:  Yes, well, I watch sports and I watch the Sunday news shows  and -- and...</p><p>CLAMAN:  Is there one you prefer?</p><p>BUFFET:  No, I...</p><p>CLAMAN:  Do you try to (INAUDIBLE) all...</p><p>BUFFET:  I watch them all.</p><p>CLAMAN:  You watch them all?</p><p>BUFFET:  I watch them all.  And I -- I have them taped and  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CLAMAN:  Oh, so you are technical?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET:  No, my wife does it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET:  And -- oh, what else do I watch here?</p><p>CLAMAN:  I mean is there a show you think out there is clever?</p><p>GATES:  Well, Comedy Ctrl is clever.</p><p>BUFFET:  Oh, of course.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yes.</p><p>GATES:  It's certainly, in a political season, there's a lot to make  fun of.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  Speaking of which, one of our viewers, one of our, actually,  our viewer Twitterers had asked, \"Who do you think might be a good vice  presidential candidate for Mitt Romney?\"</p><p>Charlie?</p><p>MUNGER:  I haven't the faintest idea.  I have some people I don't  think should qualify.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Who?</p><p>MUNGER:  Oh, I'm not going to say.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUFFET:  I was hoping you'd ask him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MUNGER:  It would be a long list.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Warren, what do you think?</p><p>BUFFET:  I think he shouldn't -- I think he would -- I think, largely,  he will.  I think he should pick somebody who he thinks would be best  qualified to serve as president of the United States if anything happened  to him.  And -- and though people don't vote for the vice presidential  candidate very -- to any great degree, so he can afford himself the luxury  of doing that.  And I think that he probably is the kind of person that  will.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Here's another Twitter person who wanted to know, \"What is  the most significant motivator in your working life and how has that  changed through the years?\"</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GATES:  Well, I've kind of shifted from the innovations at Microsoft,  which are great digital empowerment things, to helping the poorest.  And so  figures like how many less children died this year than last year, you  know, pretty exciting to see that we're getting that number down.</p><p>You know, there's still a lot of science (ph), but it's -- it's aimed  at the poorest now.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Warren, your biggest motivator?</p><p>BUFFET:  Oh, I -- just -- just running Berkshire is -- it's -- it's  fun every day.  And it's a never finished painting.  And it's always got  enough twists and turns in it to make it interesting.</p><p>So I know -- I know I'll have -- you know, I could -- I could be my  age and retire and I could spend all week planning my haircut, you know.   And this is a lot more fun.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLAMAN:  I want to thank all of you, Bill Gates, Charlie Munger and  Warren Buffet...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Thank you .</p><p>CLAMAN:  -- for joining us exclusively together.  It's always  fascinating to hear your perspectives on so many things.</p><p>Thank you for being on Fox Business.</p><p>BUFFET:  Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Stuart, back to you in New York.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2012 CNBC/Dow Jones Business  Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.

And as we look at how it's trading, it is up slightly, about .5 percent.</p><p/><p>What do you think of that trade?</p><p/><p>Do you think it would have been higher, lower?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, that doesn't change my conclusion, because of some half a percent. And, you know, I don't -- I have no idea whether Berkshire's stock will go up or down in the next week or month or year.</p><p/><p>But in relation to the businesses we own, it -- it's attractive.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: One of the number one questions that came out this weekend -- it was interesting to me, because I've been coming six years and I have never heard so many people ask why isn't Berkshire paying a dividend. This at a time when the largest percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies are now paying dividends. It's the first time in a long time that they are.</p><p/><p>And then you have the fact that you own dividend paying stocks like Coca-Cola, American Express, Intel, which just raised its dividend this morning, by the way.</p><p/><p>Why won't you pay a dividend to your shareholders?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, we think our shareholders, five years from now, will be wealthier, counting what they would get from the reinvestment of the dividend. We think they would be -- they'll be wealthier if we hold onto the money.</p><p/><p>Now, we may be wrong in that, but historically we've been right. And if -- if we had paid a dividend over the years our shareholders would be considerably poorer than they -- 10 years ago. And as long as we -- I think we will have the opportunity to invest dollars, to create more than a dollar of present value, we'll retain the money. And when we don't think we can do that we'll either repurchase stock or pay dividends.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Is there no way you will ever pay a dividend?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Oh, some day Berkshire will pay a dividend because it will get so large that it can't use the money, or all of the money that it earns, effectively.</p><p/><p>But -- but we don't think we're at that point, although we're much closer to that point, obviously, than we were 20 years ago.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I just mentioned that Coke pays a dividend. Speaking of Coke, the board is mulling a stock split.</p><p/><p>Would you be for a stock split of Coca-Cola?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I'm -- I'm totally neutral on that. It's -- it's fine with me if they do and it's fine with me if they don't.</p><p/><p>But it -- it won't make any difference to us in terms of the value of our Coca-Cola stock.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: OK. The succession plan was a very major focus here. And you said you'd be very clear about it. You do finally have one person in mind, with two back-ups. I got you to tell us yesterday that it was a he.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: But it is a male?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: It's a male.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: It is a male. OK. I talked to some shareholders who said it is becoming increasingly evident to them that it's Ajit Jain, who runs your insurance business. Keep going with the poker-faced one, because they say the insurance business is increasingly becoming the -- one of the major important factors, the most important factors for the future of Berkshire and the profits that it brings in.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Look, I would say this about the insurance business. It's been enormously important in getting us to where we are now. It's still enormously important. It's actually not as important relative to the entirety of Berkshire as it was 10 years ago. We've added more businesses away from insurance.</p><p/><p>But insurance has driven us to where we are presently.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: And the culture, you said he understands the culture of Berkshire.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Oh, all three of the candidates understand the culture very well.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: All right. All three, but Ajit at the top?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Oh, I --</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BUFFET: When -- when we put you on the board, you'll know.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: OK. All right. Only the board knows.</p><p/><p>You also said about your successor that under your new successor, there will not be much of a derivatives book under Berkshire's umbrella.</p><p/><p>Is that because you feel you really understand derivatives in a way that nobody else does or that they've become dangerous for Berkshire?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Oh, it -- it -- there isn't that much of a derivatives book right now, if you look at the total value of Berkshire. We've done very little in new revenues. But we have a few and one particularly good sized position in terms of our equity put situation. Only that's nothing compared to what we have in equities overall.</p><p/><p>So it's not a big deal now. I would guess it would be a lesser deal. And -- and partly that's because the rule -- in fact, in a big way that's because the rules have been charged on derivatives. We would not have the derivatives position we have now if the rules had been the same five or 10 years ago in relation to posting of collateral. We think that -- that derivatives become much more dangerous for the individual enterprise when they're required to post collateral.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: OK. You're 81 years old. That's not any news to anybody. But the fact that you were diagnosed with Stage 1 prostate cancer gave some people a start. It is obviously non-aggressive. And you say it's a non- issue. And you won't miss a single day of work due to your treatment, which starts in, what, July?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Mid-July.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Mid-July?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes. Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You won't miss any work at all?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No. No. No. Maybe -- maybe 15 minutes a day, something like that.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: We can lose you for 15 minutes.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, I wish -- I wish that we couldn't, but the truth is you can't.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: But when you look at the -- the person who will eventually take over, have you begun to apprentice your successor?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: My -- my successor doesn't need apprenticing. If they needed apprenticing, they wouldn't be the successor (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: They wouldn't be the one?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No. In fact, none of the three candidates would need apprenticing.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: In some of what you talked about, you talked about how great some businesses are, but you talked about a big mistake. Energy future --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: -- from a Texas utility company.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: All mine do.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: So sorry to bring it up.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I did it by myself.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: But these were tied very tightly to the price of natural gas.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Which plummeted shortly after you bought it.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: How'd you get that so wrong?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: It was easy. I'll probably be able to do it again.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BUFFET: The -- it was -- it was -- it was just a case of not -- not cranking that into my decision, weighting it with the appropriate probability.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: But 2010, you had to do a $2 billion write up -- write-down; 2011, another $398 million write-down.</p><p/><p>How much --</p><p/><p>BUFFET: (INAUDIBLE) that total. But the total -- the total we put in was about $2 billion and -- and I think it's been written out of maybe $400 million or $500 million.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Well, how much was it going to get?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, it can go all the way to zero.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Do you think it will?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: It -- it easily could.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Who -- who sold you on this idea, gold (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Me. Me.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Really?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No, no, no.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Goldman Sachs?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No, I -- I have -- I have a real ability to pick these -- pick these out.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p/><p>One of the things you said that people sat on the edge of their seat, because they want to know what you're buying, more newspapers.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: It's possible.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Jimmy Kimmel told a joke at the Washington correspondents dinner. He said, what's black, white and red all over?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes, so I heard.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Nothing.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Yet you're buying now?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: And you said specifically local newspapers.</p><p/><p>How about \"The New York Times?\"</p><p/><p>Is that local enough?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, I -- if a -- I would have to say, if I could buy \"The New York Times,\" I might buy it personally. I -- I don't know whether I'd buy it for Berkshire. But it's not for sale.</p><p/><p>It's -- that's a very special case.</p><p/><p>The newspapers that exist in communities where there's a strong sense of community and where the newspapers respond to that strong sense of community by -- by telling people a whole lot of things that they want to know about their own community that they can't find some place else, those newspapers will do OK. They'll still be in decline over time.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: But is it that you see that their value is relatively -- that their price is relatively cheap to earnings?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: In some cases.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: In some cases. But the earnings are not going to -- the earnings are not going to go up. I mean you're looking -- and -- and they're probably going to go down in most -- in practically all cases.</p><p/><p>So you have to buy them at a value, actually, that takes that into account.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: \"The Washington Post,\" you stepped down from the board.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: But you still fully own your position?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: We own every share we've ever owned.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Even though it's off its 52 week highs.</p><p/><p>Do you feel it's doing pretty well?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, it -- I don't know whether they've published their first quarter earnings yet or not. But -- but they have problems in two of their businesses, one in the education business and one in the newspaper. And -- and that's been reflected, I think, in the price.</p><p/><p>But those two businesses are -- well, the newspaper is far tougher than it was five or 10 years ago. And the education business is tougher than it was about two years ago.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: What's interesting to people, though, when you say that you would buy more newspapers is at a time when everybody else is getting out, it seems like you and Rupert Murdoch are the only people getting into newspapers.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes, right. And he may not be quite as competitive for a while, either. So, no. But they are not a -- it's not an industry whose earnings are going to -- the earnings are going to just shrink in the newspaper business, as are the revenues. But not -- I don't necessarily think they'll shrink at a dramatic rate where you have a strong feeling of community and you have a newspaper that serves that community well.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: \"The Washington Post\" reported Friday and their revenue --</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Did they?</p><p/><p>OK.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: -- fell.</p><p/><p>Yes, their revenue fell. Well, speaking of Rupert Murdoch, because I brought it up, hoc, is the head of News Corp, the parent of Fox Business.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Sure.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You -- you made a little quip about our sister network, Fox. One shareholder questioned whether your personal politics --</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: -- hurt shares of the company. And your response was, \"I really think someone making an investment decision based on the politics of whether he agrees or not with the CEO, sounds to me like he ought to own Fox.\"</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I'll leave it at that.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: What -- what do you mean by that?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, I mean, I think it's silly to make a decision --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Right.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: -- based on the politics of the CEO. I -- I can't tell you the politics of the CEOs of our major investments. There may be one or two that I would know about, but it is absolutely a zero factor in our making a decision on a business.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I guess maybe people were really meaning that they're in contradiction, they feel differently about the Buffett Rule than you do.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You clarified in September to Fox Business News that what you meant was the uber rich should pay a commensurate tax rate of about 30 percent, that a let -- a lot of the rest of Americans are paying.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Right.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Yet the Buffet -- yet the Obama administration kind of took it in a different way and is now promoting it for people who make a million dollars or more.</p><p/><p>Have you talked to the president about how he's split from what you really intended?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, that isn't really different than what I intended. I mean, I might tweak it a little bit in one direction or another. But I was talking about the people making a million or more.</p><p/><p>Now I would probably have a different break, also, for the people making $10 million or more.</p><p/><p>But the -- Senator Whitehouse is the one that put the bill in. And I wrote him a letter immediately after he did so that in -- I -- I basically approve of his bill. If I were writing the bill, I'd write it a little -- slightly different, but so would everybody else.</p><p/><p>But I -- I think it -- it gets at the -- it gets at the point that 131 out of 400 of the highest incomes in the country, those 400 incomes average $270 million each. That's not bad. That's, you know, almost three quarters of a million dollars a day. And --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: We'd take it.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes. And a -- a third of those people paid less than a 15 percent rate, combined payroll and income tax.</p><p/><p>And I -- I think -- I think that's wrong and I think it -- and in an economy where we're going to ask for shared sacrifice of people, that we ought to go after the (INAUDIBLE). It doesn't solve the revenue problem.</p><p/><p>But I think that people want a code that has at least that much fairness in it.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: But, Warren, if you feel so strongly about that, why not take a bigger salary than you always have?</p><p/><p>You've always opted to take your income in cash -- in -- in Berkshire stock versus cash.</p><p/><p>Yet if you took a bigger salary instead, you could pay that 30 percent rate.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Why not have done it that way?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, the company would get a deduction, too. So the government would be -- would be worse off rather than wise (ph), actually, because the company would get a 35 percent deduction if they paid it to me.</p><p/><p>So it's -- it -- it wouldn't change the revenue, it would just take some money from the shareholders.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Here's what -- what I heard from some other people, too, is they said, you know, when you're donating most of your -- your money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is philanthropic and wonderful and yet that will keep it from being taxed.</p><p/><p>And some would say, why not then let it be taxed, because it -- wouldn't it be helpful to give it as revenue to the government?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: That would be an alternative. But I -- I think that we will probably be able to accomplish a lot more around the world with that money going to the foundation.</p><p/><p>But it -- it's a wonderful tax dodge. I urge all you -- all the viewers if they -- if they want to pay less tax, they should give away more money.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Investments -- what other countries are you investing in?</p><p/><p>You mentioned an acquisition in the Netherlands.</p><p/><p>But what other countries' companies are starting to look good to you?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, we don't really look by country. That -- that company in the Netherlands was for sale. I mean the owners of it decided to sell it a month or so ago and -- and we ended up buying it last week.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Right.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: But we don't look much by country. It -- we -- we really look for businesses we understand, with some kind of competitive advantage and good management and a price that makes sense.</p><p/><p>And if we find that -- we found, you know, the most wonderful of all in Israel six or seven years ago. And we've -- we can find them here in the United States, usually.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: And that was ISCAR?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You said that there was a $22 billion deal that you missed by that much. You couldn't get that deal done. You wouldn't say what sector it was in.</p><p/><p>Can you say what country it was in?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No, it was -- but it was on this planet.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I tried.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, you narrowed it down.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: How does Brazil look for investment right now?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, I -- I --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: See anything you like in Brazil?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: How about that?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Well, I don't know that much about specific -- (INAUDIBLE). I mean, if we found something that was interesting in Brazil, some business I understood, it was large, the price was right. The management was right, we'd buy it in a second.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You have bought some European stocks recently.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: That is true.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Which ones?</p><p/><p>I mean it's going to come out in an SEC filing eventually, won't it?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No, actually, we don't have to report the foreign stocks.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You don't have to report it?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: So you won't say?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No, that's true.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: OK. But would you say, 10, 11, 12 coun -- companies?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: It was about -- I think it was more like nine.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Nine?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: This morning, folks, when <person><nameText>Warren Buffet </nameText></person>arrived here at our shoot, he quickly went upstairs to put in stock orders.</p><p/><p>European stock orders?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Not today.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Not today.</p><p/><p>So at -- U.S. equities?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: That's what's left, yes.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Because I did say it was on this planet, yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: U.S. equities look cheap then at this point, with the markets the way they are today?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Some do.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Some do.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Some do, sure.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Let's talk about the news of the weekend, as well. Nicolas Sarkozy is out in France.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: He's out. Yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: And Francois Hollande, who is, of course, a Socialist, is in.</p><p/><p>This is disconcerting to a lot of people who wonder, will we see capital flight away from France, the likes of what we saw when Francois Mitterand, who was also a Socialist, was elected years ago.</p><p/><p>Will people take their money out of France?</p><p/><p>Do you predict that or could you see that?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I -- I don't know the answer to that. I -- I would not be enthused if I had a Socialist win anyplace. But -- but the -- I think the problems facing Europe transcend, almost, you know, those in any specific country. I mean they have to work out the rules under which 17 countries can really work together. When they lock themselves into a monetary unit. And they haven't locked themselves in in a number of other ways.</p><p/><p>So, I think overall what happens in Europe is probably maybe affected by the leaders in given countries, but it's going to be much more important than any specific election.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You just said locked into a specific currency. Was the euro idea a mistake?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Getting out of it would be an enormous problem, too, but I think maybe it was a mistake. As it was done. In fact, I can say it was a mistake as it was done. Now the question is whether you can modify the original concept in some way that makes this more workable than it is proving to be.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Well, as it morphs and changes, Greece has parliamentary elections and neo-Nazis were elected to the parliament. Is it just a matter of time before Greece either leaves or gets jettisoned from the euro zone?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I don't know about - I think it's a matter of time until they come up with a better solution than the present structure or they abandon it entirely. Who knows which it will happen?</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Forty-seven years later from you starting your company, you finally invested in a technology stock or two. IBM and Intel --</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Yes, I didn't - I didn't do the Intel.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You didn't do the Intel. You did the IMB.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Who did the Intel?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Yes, it would have been Todd because he was the only one -</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: OK. Todd did -- Todd Holmes, who is one of your new investment managers. It was his idea. But you never bought Microsoft. Did you hear from your board member <person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>about that?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I can't buy -- I can't buy Microsoft. If we bought Microsoft, for one thing, our buying days take place month after month after month. And if something happened that was favorable at Microsoft, people would have said I had insider information.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Well, actually, let's bring in <person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>right now, who founded Microsoft -</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Maybe he'll give me some insider information!</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Now's the time.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: What's inside information at Microsoft (ph)?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: When you heard that he finally bought a technology stock and IBM and Intel, did you think those were pretty good ideas?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>BILL GATES, </nameText></person>FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: Well, I think it is great that Todd gets the entire universe to exercise his great thinking. And he has done a good job there.</p><p/><p>A lot of technology companies, you can't see where they will be in 10 years or 20 years. IBM has enough service revenue that they may be somewhat of an exception to that. But most tech stocks, you know, play a very high- variance game, which makes it I think the most interesting in the street in the world. But not for an investor who wants any degree of downside protection.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: He told me that when I met him in 1991, too.</p><p/><p>And what point should be made about Todd. Todd can change his positions far, far easier than I can. So, Todd is working with sums. If he decides to move onto something else, he can - he can do that. I can't do that with the big positions that we take. So, we are really locked in more than he would be.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Bill, you just said that with many tech stocks, you can't see where they will be in ten to 20 years. Can you see, Warren, where Facebook would be in 10 to 20 years?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: No, no I can't. I mean, it is an enormously impressive accomplishment. And my guess is it has a big future of some sort. But I have no idea. I didn't even know what it was six or seven years ago. And I'm still not on it, so -</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Bill, are you on Facebook?</p><p/><p>GATES: Sure.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You are on Twitter as well.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: He's in a different world.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Always have been. In fact, I remember when you were saying Bill had to teach you how to just simply click on the blue E for Explorer.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: He's had his problems with me.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, Warren's a big tech user (ph) if you count online bridge.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: That's right.</p><p/><p>GATES: That takes him up into the top one percent in terms of Internet addicts.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I'm like a guy who's (INAUDIBLE) to turn on the switch. And then, as far as I'm concerned, there's some guy inside that thing that's playing - (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Listen, let's talk about Facebook. It's huge news today. The beginning of the road show.</p><p/><p>Bill, you have been dealing with investors and analysts for years and banks for years and years. Would you tell Mark Zuckerberg -- because there is question as to whether he will attend the road show. Would you say, you know, you really should get out there and do it?</p><p/><p>GATES: I know when Microsoft had to do its road show, I minimized the amount of time. I think I offered three days, I told them no limousines. I took a book about biology. I was reading during the breaks. I tried not to have it take too much time away from the business. You know, so, you've got to focus on what is important in making sure your profit friend (ph) users is great -- as number one</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: This is a guy that negotiated down with his mother (INAUDIBLE) down to an hour over the time he was willing to spend with me.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, I didn't know what I was in for. I thought --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Didn't want to spend more than an hour with Buffett? Your mom said meet the guy, and --</p><p/><p>GATES: Before Warren and I met, I wasn't sure we had that much to talk about. Now, I was 100 percent wrong about that, but my mom made me say I would stay a few hours at this event that Kay, Graham and Warren were at. In fact, I stayed the whole day, and I was disappointed when Warren was leaving because talking about business and the dynamics of how things were changing I found somebody I'm part of -- one of the most interesting parts of my life. A lifelong conversation.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: His mom was prying us apart at the end.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: What would you advise Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook to attend that road show?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I wouldn't worry too much. I mean - you know, that offering was going to be big. I'm not saying the stock is going to go, but it is going to get all the attention in the world. And people know what Facebook is. I mean, it's not a mystery that has to be explained.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Can it --</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Except to me!</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: If -- if it does have $100 billion valuation or whatever the crazy numbers are out there, can it sustain that? What does it need to do to sustain that? What does it need to do to sustain that, Bill?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, it just needs to have advertising revenue that makes that earnings dream properly discounted be greater than $100 billion.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>GATES: And -</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Simple!</p><p/><p>GATES: It's right there in \"The Intelligent Investor\"!</p><p/><p>You know, they have a lot of traffic. And the ability to monetize that traffic over time will be fascinating to see if they can push up and go beyond the earnings stream you need for that or not. But it is one phenomenally impressive company.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Bill, everybody is always talking about the succession plan. And you know, you went through this very issue back when you decided to leave the CEO position at Microsoft. The stock has done really well lately, and Windows 8 is about to blast onto the scene. And I hear from -- Recover Silicon Valley heavily at Fox Business. And I hear from them that once Windows 8 gets into the ultra-books and it becomes a touch screen, you could very well take on the Mac Air and the MacBook.</p><p/><p>Is that what Microsoft should be aiming for, and do you think it could happen with Ultra Books?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, it is very exciting that Windows 8 is coming out. It's a very big deal for the company. Steve and the whole team are doing a great job there. It creates a new category of machines that are sort of -- have the good things about tablets and the good things about PCs. And so, it's going to evolve these digital tools.</p><p/><p>You know, people right now like the tablet, but it's hard to -</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Type on.</p><p/><p>GATES: -- to give input. You don't have Microsoft Office on there. And so, with our hardware partners, there's a lot of neat stuff that comes out later year.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Warren, what kind of computer do you use?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I think it's an HP that the guys at the furniture market (ph) sent over.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Well, what do you use, Bill?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, I have a Samsung tablet is my primary machine, but I have Dell machines and a variety. I'm always getting the latest and greatest.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: So, no iPad for you.</p><p/><p>GATES: No, no, -- I said I am using the latest and greatest.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Bill has -- they have a chimpanzee up there in Seattle, and then they have me and then they have us both test these new things.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>And, actually, I am more reliable than the chimpanzee.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Do you have an iPad, Warren?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: No.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: No. So, you're not going for the tablet at this point.</p><p/><p>Bill, let's just say the Samsung Galaxy has gone traction, but not nearly as much as the iPad has. Rim couldn't come out with a tablet that smacked it down nor hp.</p><p/><p>What company out there has the special something that can take on that iPad in your opinion?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, the tablets base is going to grow, but you really want something where you either have a pen or keyboard and you have your productivity applications. So, you want the best of both worlds, and that is what Microsoft and others are pushing for.</p><p/><p>I think this fall, people will understand that there is room for big improvement there.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Microsoft just made a pretty big deal, about $300 million with Barnes &amp; Noble. Will eventually that morph into a deal to make some type of tablet or a Kindle with Microsoft abilities to jack it up?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, the idea is they are going to take their reading experience and books and make them look super good on these new devices. And so, on these devices, you want to run Office where you create documents. But you want to consume books in new ways, consume videos in new ways. And so, it's that merger and having their team do innovative work is what made that investment a smart idea.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Warren, you said this weekend you would not buy Apple.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Well, I said I wouldn't know enough to buy Apple. Yes. But no, I'm not going to buy anything I don't feel I can have a reasonable fix on what they will look like in five or ten years. And I certainly didn't have a reasonable fix - I wish I had -- ten years ago on Apple but I don't have one now.</p><p/><p>I think it's an amazing company. But there are lots of businesses I don't understand.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Bill, tech companies have gotten so desperate to have the latest and greatest technology that they are trying to buy in in patents. They're trying to buy chunks of patents, you know, with the Motorola mobility issue. Today, a judge is going to consider, I believe, that Microsoft's complaint that Motorola is charging for what really should be basic technology patents.</p><p/><p>Have the patent wars gotten a little out of hand?</p><p/><p>GATES: No, I think the idea that invention is valuable has become more obvious. It was always true in the drug industry that the whole industry, these miracle medicine exists, because patents were protecting that invention.</p><p/><p>And fortunately, we are seeing more invention in many areas. The IT sector has got a lot, but you know, if you come up with a renewable energy design, that is going to be protected by a patent.</p><p/><p>So, patents are important. There are immensely complex, and sometimes when people look at it either because of the complexity of the system because they haven't looked into it, it seems strange to them. But the idea that invention has value - I think that is an idea that is more and more important over time.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Warren?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Oh, I agree. I just don't know how to invent anything.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: There have been a couple of corporate scandals. Among them, Apple and Foxconn. Foxconn is one of the manufacturers of components of Apple's products. They were accused of mistreating their workers and in some cases underpaying them.</p><p/><p>Did Apple handle that right? Would you care if you found out that one of your companies under the Berkshire umbrella was buying a lot of stuff from people who mistreated their workers?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Sure, and we hope that all our companies are looking at all kinds of things including that. But f you have a very, very large company something is going to go wrong. And right now I can tell you with 270,000 employees at Berkshire, someone is doing something they shouldn't. I just hope it is small, I hope we find out about it, and then I hope whoever is in charge does something about it properly but you cannot run a large army or a large government bureau or large church without things going wrong from time to time. It's going to happen.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: It is going to happen but this Foxconn issue was out there. Wired Magazine a year and a half ago had a huge front-page story about it, Bill. I'm just wondering -- had that ever happened to you at Microsoft? Would you look at that and say Apple really should have dealt with that much more quickly?</p><p/><p>GATES: I think American companies overall are improving labor conditions when they're involved in whether it is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or really looking down the supply chain at trying to make sure labor conditions are okay, I think American business has had a positive effect. I don't know specifics of the Apple case but I know they are not going to try to take shortcuts in that way. They are certainly very focused on fixing any problems at this point.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You mentioned the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That's pretty controversial with Wal-Mart lately and a lot of people saying hey, that is how you get business done in Mexico. What is your response to that?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: My responses is that we have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It may very well be that's the way business is done in Mexico but you'd better not do it if you are an American corporation.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Maybe the crime was less important than the cover-up.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: It's always a problem. I mean, I know something's being done that's wrong at Berkshire, I can't tell what it is and --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: But Warren, if somebody came to you and you knew about it, like the Wal-Mart top executives did, would you say \"don't be so aggressive on that?\"</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: No, but I think almost all CEOs when they know the facts - - it certainly seems quite clear there was bribery in all of that. Exactly what happened after that, I'm not sure about, but I would think there are very few American CEOs that if they find out about some problems, they're going to try to figure out something to do and something about them promptly.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Bill, earlier we were talking with Warren about how he wants to buy more newspapers.</p><p/><p>GATES: He's not going to compete with me.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You are not going to buy newspapers? Because he got the idea to buy railroads back in 2006 from you. You were already in a Canadian railroad.</p><p/><p>GATES: No, Warren's has been playing with railroads since he was a boy.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: That's right.</p><p/><p>GATES: I can hardly take credit for introducing him to that whole sector of the economy.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I'm repeating what he told me.</p><p/><p>GATES: He's very generous. We both made good money. We're happy railroad investors.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You both -- and I knew this about Warren, but I didn't know you used to be a newspaper delivery boy.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Absolutely. I was far better than Warren. It's really one of those things that needs more coverage.</p><p/><p>[laughter]</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I was there yesterday, he didn't show up.</p><p/><p>[laughter]</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: We got video of it. There was a newspaper throwing contest where we all tossed Omaha World Heralds to the porch of a Clayton home.</p><p/><p>GATES: Exactly.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I was stunned to see, here's Warren, you made it right to the porch, and then Bill exactly in the same position, that little boy is one of your grandsons.</p><p/><p>GATES: He won that.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I own the house and the newspaper, I better be close enough.</p><p/><p>[laughter]</p><p/><p>GATES: When it came to ping-pong, I would say I was a little better. We're 1 to 1 for the weekend.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: That's right.</p><p/><p>[CROSSTALK]</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: 2 on 1. Then you brought up the gigantic paddle.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: That didn't work either. [laughter]</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: In the past you've done a lot of things. You've danced with the Nebraska cheerleaders. You've ridden a bull. That must have been incredible. Back then when you were doing it, you were in your 70s. They are both looking at the monitor.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Absolutely. I look as bad as I look there as I do here.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, your vice chairman, never participates in sitting on the bull or throwing the newspapers, why not?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: He's the thinker in the group.</p><p/><p>[laughter]</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: In fact here he is, Charlie Munger, the vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway, joining us now. Good morning Charlie. Welcome to the party here.</p><p/><p>CHARLIE MUNGER, VICE CHAIR, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Charlies, there was so much focus this weekend on Warren's health and his succession plan and how much longer Warren will be running the company. Let's turn it to you, how much longer will you be up on stage with Warren for these annual shareholder meetings?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: I serve a very important function because people look at me and think they will get another seven years out of Warren. I don't think he's anxious to get rid of me.</p><p/><p>[laughter]</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I'm there to show there's some guy older than me in American business. Makes me look very good when I'm up there.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: How much longer will you participate? Somebody said is this Charlie's last year?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: No.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Well, I hope not.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You have every plan to remain on the stage at these meetings?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: I'm not going to sit up there drooling. But I plan to be there. If the only way to get up is to drool, then I'll drool.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You were as feisty as ever. One comment you made got a round of applause from the audience that was on the mortgage and lending bubble. And you said this -- this is stuff you have said over the past couple of years, but you've never phrased it like this before, you said it was wrong not to stamp down on felony and folly of all that irresponsible lending, quote I often say \"Alan Greenspan overdosed on Ayn Rand.\" Meaning the whole free market hands-off approach was a total disaster?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Certainly. Most of these have limits. In other words, an ax murderer is not a good thing because it happens in a free market. There's a limit to when the free market is -- [inaudible] a free market with that kind of fraud and folly it is not wise to allow it. We were disgraceful to sit there and let Canada be sensible while we went crazy.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I would say this in, in fairness to Alan Greenspan and Charlie has made this point that he has said that he's sort of overestimated -- overestimated the ability of the free market to natural operations to rein in -- all the self-interest that --</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Yes, Alan Greenspan is the only person who has apologized.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Who else should apologize?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: There's a big list, practically everybody.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Banks, U.S. banks?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Oh, my God, yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Dodd Frank, now we have that, but the last numbers I looked at, it is 850 pages long. The Volcker Rule alone breaks down to 380 plus questions and those have more than 1400 sub-questions. Will that be the thing that prevents us from dealing with this type of disaster again?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Well, it was certainly a step in the right direction. If I had the power, I would have made the Volcker act look like a non-restraint. I would have done much more.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: So you think that preventing banks from investing in the proprietary trading issue? They are all complaining, Charlie, that that's ruining their ability to do well and do well for shareholders.</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Well, that's natural when people were making a lot of money out of something to not want to be forced out of it. These banks ought to only be open on Christmas. They ought to have a fairly restricted repertoire.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Well, we the taxpayers bailed out a lot of them, including AIG. In the news today is the Treasury Department will try and sell off more taxpayer holdings of AIG. Do you think the bailout of AIG was something we had to do?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Probably.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Do you think the taxpayer, Warren, will see a profit on that?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Yes, the way it is going, they will show a profit, yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, do you think so?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Barely.</p><p/><p>[laughter]</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: He hated to say that.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: There's belief, trying to jump-start the economy, that if you get rid of onerous regulation -- not all regulation, but onerous regulation -- that businesses will invest more and grow more. You guys own businesses, Lubrizol which is heavily regulated I'm sure, Burlington Northern the railroad heavily regulated. The regulations -- if the regulations were diluted just a bit, would you invest more, that would mean more hiring and the economy would come back?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: The answer is no. Sure there are regulations that don't make any sense out there and there always will be. It is a very big complicated economy, but we are dying to make investments and we invested more money last year than we ever have in the history of Berkshire and we'll break that record again this year. American corporations have lots and lots and lots of liquidity, and where they see demand, they're going to invest in facilities that meet that demand.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: No matter what?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Bill, in your high-tech field, what regulation do you think -- he just talked about regulations that should be banished but what regulation holds you back that you really feel shouldn't be there?</p><p/><p>GATES: I think the closest thing to that is whether or not an engineer who is trained in the United States but is a foreign citizen, it should be easy for them and they should be allowed to be a taxpayer here or they should be forced to go back and the jobs around them created in another country. So the high-tech, high-skills immigration issue is one that definitely affects the job picture.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Senator John Kerry has the Startup Visa Act which would if there's a foreigner give them a green card if they have enough investment, they start a business, and they would hire some people, is that something, Charlie, you think is a good idea?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Yes, but I think Bill's idea is a much bigger idea. I think we're out of our minds to send brilliant people back when they want to stay here.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I feel stronger about that than I used to. I mean it is crazy.</p><p/><p>MUNGER: -- could be stronger.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: It just makes no sense. Bill gave you the best answer you could have on it.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Why then do we have it, we make it so difficult with the H1B visa, which is the issue, would you say if you had the opportunity, Bill, to have the president's ear on that issue, surely he knows?</p><p/><p>GATES: There are various things that have not gotten through the Congress, you know, people want to make sure you're doing your best to hire American workers, and so there's a legitimate concern there. But there's a way to be more liberal on this without at all substituting for domestic labor -- labor that you might have used.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You have a lot of people that are worried about -- they marry the issue of the border with Mexico with brilliant engineers who are coming from India and China. Is there a way to separate that? Would it be a better idea, Charlie?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Of course it would be a better idea, of course it should be done. This is a competitive world, you do not want to send the brains back.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: What bill is talking about would increase employment in the United States.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Brains. You bought some brains in China, Charlie. BYD, the electric car company, it is fun to see you two disagree on stage. You disagreed about the VAT tax. Charlie thinks we should have a VAT tax. Later, Warren, you told me you didn't think that was a good idea.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Right.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Going to electric vehicles, you feel, Charlie, that we should be giving government incentives and real carrots to inspire people to drive more electric vehicles; correct?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: We already do. I have a niece and her husband who commute in Washington, D.C. and because they ride in a Prius, they get to use the fast lane. That's a huge incentive.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: There's an incentive.</p><p/><p>MUNGER: There is a lot of incentive and there should be.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Should it be, Warren, at the expense because the money has to come from somewhere, at big oil, which is well-established and is getting a lot of tax breaks?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Charlie is the expert on this subject.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Should we sort of lessen what we have given to the oil companies over the years and switch it over to electric vehicles?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: I don't think the big problem of America is the oil companies have been favored too much.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You don't think that's a problem?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Yes, by and large. Exxon is a technical meritocracy which is a very creditable place. In other words, if more of America ran like Exxon, it would be a better country.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Let's get to Keystone, then. The Keystone pipeline was rejected initially. Now the new proposal from Transcanada is going. You are both Nebraska residents -- you live in California now, Charlie, but you're from Nebraska. You are also business people. The new route and when we get more details we will know but would you be for the Keystone pipeline if it doesn't threaten the aquifer and it doesn't threaten the areas that are culturally sensitive and environmentally sensitive?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I'm not an expert, but it generally sounds like it makes a lot of sense to me. Awful lot of pipelines running through the United States. Net, they have certainly been a huge plus for the country. I don't know all the details on it, but based on what I know, I would say that it makes sense.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Were you then disappointed when Keystone was rejected, it could mean so many jobs?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I don't think that issue is done with yet. The jobs aspect of it is not the big aspect. The real question is what it will do for the country over many years and what the drawbacks are. But you can build anything that will create jobs. That doesn't mean it is a good idea.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Bill, you are invested in alternative energy and some of it a certain subsector of nuclear, but looking at natural gas, wow, it is so unbelievably inexpensive now and cleaner than oil, do you think this country should be converting to nat gas burning cars and trucks?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, natural gas, unfortunately, the energy density unless you take it to a very low temperature is much lower, so there's a lot of innovators looking at how can we do that better. There are ways of converting natural gas to liquids, but those factories are very expensive so people are going to try to innovate. There's such good news that we have inexpensive natural gas. It is the most natural that we get the benefit of that in the power generation sector as we're turning over our power plants, but because the price is so attractive on an equivalent energy basis there will be innovations that move it into parts of the transport sector, that's very exciting.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, you said on stage this weekend we should not look for energy independence, we should use up the bad guys' energy --</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Or the good guys, like Canada.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Or the good guys but conserve our own.</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Right. That to me is an obvious conclusion considering how precious this stuff is going to get. Trying to use our whole supply, our reserves as fast as possible is insane.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: But you could arguably stick it to certain Arab nations who despise the United States and they despise Israel and make life difficult for everybody by completely turning off the spigot and not use their oil and then you hit them financially, no?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: My desire to do spiteful things to the Arab nations is zero. As long as they want to sell their oil, I'm delighted to see us buy it rather than use our own. I think that adults suffer now to be better off later. When you save your own oil, and buy the other fellows', that's what you're doing.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You drove an electric car, you said the most recent BYD, do you own an electric car?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: No.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: What do you drive, Charlie?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: A Mercedes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: What do you drive, Warren?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Cadillac.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Bill, what car do you usually use?</p><p/><p>GATES: I have a Mercedes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Two Mercedes. Mercedes is buying advertising right now on Fox Business, so thank you very much, we hope.</p><p/><p>[laughter]</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You both took swipes at business school this weekend which I thought was interesting. You don't think they are teaching the right things. Warren, you went to business school.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Apparently.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Columbia.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: And I had a fabulous teacher. I went there because -- two fabulous teachers. And I went there because two people that I really wanted to sit at their feet and I got a chance to do that.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: And you're generous to business schools. You host more than 40 of them every year --</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: 48.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: 48, let them come here and take questions. That's certainly wonderful. What is it that business schools are doing wrong?</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Well, in the investment field I thought that over the last 40 or so years that most -- a great many business schools were teaching nonsense. But that doesn't mean they were in other aspects of other majors within the business schools.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Bill, Charlie, would either of you make a decision to hire somebody based on whether the candidate had gone to business school? Bill?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, if they are a young person, that's a recent part of their resume, so it might give them some valuable skills. I don't think anybody is saying that business school doesn't have some merit to it. It's just the -- how you do investment valuation as they have tried to apply mathematical techniques, they have claimed more than they should for these techniques.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I hired a young woman a couple years ago out of business school, and she would have been very good naturally, but I'm sure she was better because she'd gone to business school, but I didn't hire her for what she learned about investments in the business school.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Charlie?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: I said I thought the business schools were improving, which I think is true, including in the investment field, but they have a lot of room for it.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: The Buffett rule, that's getting so much attention. Charlie, what did you think when Warren pushed for the Buffett rule and has been quite vocal about it?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Well, it's caused me some lack of popularity at my country club, and I'm willing to bear it in order to participate in Berkshire. I think it's fine if the rich people pay more taxes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Warren, you know --</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: I think it's fine if he pays more taxes too.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Do you see the other side of it that, oh, the wealthy are the ones who are paying the biggest amount of taxes and that a large percentage of people don't pay any taxes aside from sales taxes, etcetera? That whole argument.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Well the etcetera is payroll taxes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p/><p>BUFFETT: Payroll taxes are $800 billion of a $2.3 trillion dono -- revenue thing. So payroll taxes are a huge element of our revenue base.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Charlie?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Well, I don't like the idea that nobody but the rich should pay taxes, because the country can't work on taxes from the rich people. It won't produce enough. And it would have terrible economic effects.</p><p/><p>So I don't like this politics of envy style of -- of discourse.</p><p/><p>But I think the rich people should cheerfully pay more taxes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: We already talked to Warren about the developments in Europe this morning, with France turning socialist with Francois Hollande, who's the Socialist president. The U.S. banks, Warren, you said were in a far, far better position. But both you and Charlie sat here a year ago on Fox Business and really were quite concerned about what would happen with Europe.</p><p/><p>Can the European banks -- or at least some of them -- are they so weak that they can somehow systematically negatively affect U.S. banks or our banking system here, Charlie?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: I don't think it will have that much effect on us. But I do think they still have a terrible problem.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Warren?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes, I agree with that. But, obviously, it would have some effect, but as I say, I do not think our fate is in the hands of European banks. And I'd worry very much if I were.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Well, they're all very cheap.</p><p/><p>Are -- are you -- would you (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>BUFFET: They're not -- they're not necessarily cheap.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: So you're not considering buying any?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I -- I -- there's not a European bank that I'm looking at.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Not a European bank you're looking at. Internationally, by virtue of the fact that you're huge in insurance in this -- in this company, we cannot ignore the risk that is lurking out of Iran and its plans for nuclear dependence and -- and perhaps eventually dominance.</p><p/><p>Are you writing -- are any of your insurance companies writing any policies related to that risk of Iran?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: We exclude nuclear (INAUDIBLE). But that's been true generally for a long time. We exclude. And the nuclear risk is one that all the resources of the insurance industry can't handle. So it would be folly to write it, because people wouldn't get the protection they thought they were getting.</p><p/><p>So nuclear is out of the question.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, are you concerned about what is happening in Iran and -- and do you see an eventual military tension between U.S.-Iran or -- or Iran and Israel, which would eventually, perhaps, draw in the United States?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Well, I don't think I know much about how it's going to work. And I am deeply suspicious of other people who claim to know what's going to happen exactly.</p><p/><p>I think the future is often very hard to know.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Trans -- we already talked about TransCanada.</p><p/><p>Let's -- let's just quickly move on to your -- your lifestyle.</p><p/><p>What newspapers or Web sites do you guys read every morning?</p><p/><p>We have a lot of viewers who asked about this.</p><p/><p>Bill, every morning, what do you reach for?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, I read \"New York Times,\" \"Wall Street Journal.\" \"The Economist\" is sort of my regular weekly fare.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: He -- he can give you last week's by memory. He -- he knows every word.</p><p/><p>GATES: No, it's great, it's great to have something you read on a regular basis. And they do special sections.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Charlie, what do you read?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Well, I agree with Bill. I think the best one publication I read is \"The Economist.\"..</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>MUNGER: -- which is interesting.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes, well, I read that, but I -- I -- I read the local paper. I read the \"FT.\" I read \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I read \"The New York Times\" and I -- and I read \"USA Today.\"</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: What do you watch on TV?</p><p/><p>People wanted to know that, aside from sports, because I know you're a big sports fan.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Yes, well, I watch sports and I watch the Sunday news shows and -- and...</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Is there one you prefer?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No, I...</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Do you try to (INAUDIBLE) all...</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I watch them all.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You watch them all?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I watch them all. And I -- I have them taped and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Oh, so you are technical?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BUFFET: No, my wife does it.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BUFFET: And -- oh, what else do I watch here?</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I mean is there a show you think out there is clever?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, Comedy Ctrl is clever.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Oh, of course.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Yes.</p><p/><p>GATES: It's certainly, in a political season, there's a lot to make fun of.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Speaking of which, one of our viewers, one of our, actually, our viewer Twitterers had asked, \"Who do you think might be a good vice presidential candidate for Mitt Romney?\"</p><p/><p>Charlie?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: I haven't the faintest idea. I have some people I don't think should qualify.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Who?</p><p/><p>MUNGER: Oh, I'm not going to say.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I was hoping you'd ask him.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MUNGER: It would be a long list.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Warren, what do you think?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: I think he shouldn't -- I think he would -- I think, largely, he will. I think he should pick somebody who he thinks would be best qualified to serve as president of the United States if anything happened to him. And -- and though people don't vote for the vice presidential candidate very -- to any great degree, so he can afford himself the luxury of doing that. And I think that he probably is the kind of person that will.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Here's another Twitter person who wanted to know, \"What is the most significant motivator in your working life and how has that changed through the years?\"</p><p/><p>Bill?</p><p/><p>GATES: Well, I've kind of shifted from the innovations at Microsoft, which are great digital empowerment things, to helping the poorest. And so figures like how many less children died this year than last year, you know, pretty exciting to see that we're getting that number down.</p><p/><p>You know, there's still a lot of science (ph), but it's -- it's aimed at the poorest now.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Warren, your biggest motivator?</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Oh, I -- just -- just running Berkshire is -- it's -- it's fun every day. And it's a never finished painting. And it's always got enough twists and turns in it to make it interesting.</p><p/><p>So I know -- I know I'll have -- you know, I could -- I could be my age and retire and I could spend all week planning my haircut, you know. And this is a lot more fun.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I want to thank all of you, <person><nameText>Bill Gates, </nameText></person>Charlie Munger and <person><nameText>Warren Buffet...</nameText></person></p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you .</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: -- for joining us exclusively together. It's always fascinating to hear your perspectives on so many things.</p><p/><p>Thank you for being on Fox Business.</p><p/><p>BUFFET: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Stuart, back to you in New York.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2012 CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.

It marks Berkshire's first investment in Apple.</p><p>Berkshire acquired its position at an average price of about $109 a share. </p><p>But the value of that investment, originally worth around $1.1 billion, has already dropped significantly. Investors have been worried about slowing demand for iPhones after Apple reported disappointing earnings last month.</p><p>Apple's stock price has since fallen to just above $90, meaning that Berkshire's stake in Apple is now worth about $888 million.</p><p>Shares of Apple are down 14% so far in 2016, making it -- along with Intel and Goldman Sachs-- one of the worst stocks in the Dow this year.</p><p>Apple competitor Alphabet -- the parent company of Google and owner of the Android mobile operating system -- recently overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company as well.</p><p>Still, shares of Apple, which hit a new 52-week low on Thursday, rose 2% in early trading Monday on the news of Berkshire's stake. That move vaulted Apple back ahead of Alphabet in the market cap race.</p><p>The Apple purchase is the second big tech investment by Berkshire, which has been steadily adding to its stake in IBM during the past few years. </p><p>Berkshire is also backing a takeover bid for the core assets of struggling Internet company Yahoo.</p><p>Until recently, Buffett had been famous for his lack of investments in the tech sector.</p><p>It's worth noting, though, that Buffett's position in Apple is still relatively small compared to Berkshire's top holdings -- most notably Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, IBM, American Express and Phillips 66.</p><p>And another billionaire <person><nameText>investor, Carl Icahn, </nameText></person>recently disclosed that his firm has sold its entire stake in Apple due to concerns about competition in China. </p><p><person><nameText>Apple CEO </nameText></person>Tim Cook is currently visiting China on a goodwill tour of sorts. Apple also just disclosed a $1 billion stake in Didi, a Chinese ridesharing rival to Uber. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

She showed that again Thursday evening at an outdoor town hall forum at the downtown Waterfront Park on San Diego Bay.</p><p>She didn't even refer to the president until about 45 minutes into her hourlong talk to a crowd the campaign estimated at 8,500 - and even then only briefly in response to a question.</p><p>As with other campaign stops, she shared not only her vision to remake pillars of American society and business - from health care to technology - but touched on her plans to make it happen.</p><p>It's hard to argue against the success of her approach so far.</p><p>Warren came to town as arguably the new front-runner for the Democratic nomination. She has taken the lead in most recent national polls from former Vice President Joe Biden and is at the top of surveys in key early-voting states, such as Iowa, New Hampshire - and California.</p><p>Months ago, Warren gained attention for releasing detailed policy prescriptions for the nation's ills, though not everyone agrees that they're the right ones. That earned her the \"wonk\" label, with the suggestion that while she's smart and does her homework, she lacks pizzazz.</p><p>But Warren has become known for her energy, enthusiasm and empathy that connects her with ever-growing crowds. Those crowds have become enamored with the candidate and the mantra emblazoned on campaign t-shirts: \"Warren has a plan for that.\" </p><p>Warren mentioned her plans and goals, but mostly connected them to a lengthy chronology about her background and how her family survived hard times after her father became gravely ill and could no longer work. Her mother, then in her 50s, had never had a job but went out and got a minimum-wage position to hold the family together.</p><p>She said it wasn't just a family story, but a story about wages and how government regulates them.</p><p>\"A minimum-wage job could support a family of three,\" she said. \"Today, minimum wage would send a mother and baby into poverty. That's is wrong and that's why I'm in this fight.\"</p><p>Warren connected that to what she says is government's skewed priorities favoring big business over families.</p><p>\"It's about who government works for,\" she said. \"Think about it this way: We have a government that works fabulously for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to get a prescription filled.\"</p><p>Warren kept with a largely populist appeal as opposed to detailed policy descriptions and her lines about combating corruptions, restructuring the economy and protecting democracy were met with loud cheers.</p><p>If Warren wins or does well in early voting states such as Iowa and her neighboring New Hampshire in early February, that momentum could prove pivotal in the California primary just weeks later on March 3.</p><p>A poll by the Public Policy Institute of California released Wednesday showed right now it's a three-way Democratic race in the state, with Warren at 23 percent support, one point ahead of Biden, who was one point ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. (The survey was conducted before news broke Wednesday about Sanders' heart procedure.) California Sen. Kamala Harris trailed at 8 percent.</p><p>A poll by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies released last week had Warren with a wide lead in California with 29 percent to 20 percent for Biden and 19 percent for Sanders. Harris again was at 8 points.</p><p>It's early and the race is transitory. The PPIC poll showed that voters were still open to supporting other candidates. Harris could catch fire but judging from last night's adoring crowd, the senator from the other coast seemed more like California's favorite daughter candidate, at least for the moment.</p><p>Analysts question whether her sweeping policies - Medicare-for-all, breaking up big tech companies, doing away with college tuition and relieving student debt - are too much and too left for the general voting public. Perhaps. But her railing against corporate excess and corruption certainly resonates with her audiences, as they did Thursday night, and likely beyond. She continues to face the electability question, though some polls show her besting Trump in head-to-head match-ups.</p><p>Her support is considered deep but narrow, with a core demographic of white, well-educated liberals. She'll need to diversify and signaled in San Diego that she may indeed have a plan for that.</p><p>Before the town hall forum, her campaign announced that she has been endorsed by San Diego Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, who is not only a power in Sacramento as chair of the Appropriations Committee, but has become something of a national figure by authoring ground-breaking laws. She is also chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus.</p><p>Guess who warmed up the crowd and introduced Warren Thursday night?</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:michael.smolens@sduniontribune.com\">michael.smolens@sduniontribune.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0103379835</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6B-WWP1-DY37-F3FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The train stops in Menlo Park (home to Facebook), Mountain View (home to Google) and Sunnyvale (near Apple's headquarters).</p><p>  The appetite among politicians and regulators to break up tech giants is growing. On Friday, news broke that the Justice Department is exploring opening an investigation into Google for potential antitrust violations. The Federal Trade Commission is taking a look at Amazon. And it's not just politicians thinking about this: In May, a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, wrote an essay titled ''It's time to break up Facebook.''</p><p>  ''I've been talking for years about how Big Tech has too much power over our economy and our democracy,'' Ms. Warren wrote in an email to The New York Times. ''I'm going to keep making the case for my plan to break up Big Tech and put power back in the hands of the American people -- whether it's at SXSW, a town hall in Iowa or a billboard in the heart of Silicon Valley.''</p><p>  While San Francisco is not exactly the heart of Silicon Valley -- that would be about 20 miles south on the Caltrain line -- her billboard, which went up on Wednesday, is above a lot of tech workers. And many are not thrilled with it.</p><p>  A good portion of the people at that San Francisco intersection during the rush were drawn here by the tech industry. They are here to work for one of the big companies (most of the firms also have large offices in San Francisco), or for a start-up, or they are lawyers for tech, or doing market research for tech, or they run pizza shops for tech workers.</p><p>  Though the economic windfall has helped exacerbate what some residents and officials say is growing inequality, others who have found a niche in town are wary of messing with success.</p><p>  ''There isn't a single person here who doesn't benefit from these companies,'' said Tony Riviera, 61, who owns a few restaurants around San Francisco, including the nearby Slices Pizzeria. ''These guys are out working hard, making good money and spending good money, and if it weren't for tech this city would be dead.''</p><p>  He said the senator had ''bought some bad placement.'' He added that he had some food-tech ideas.</p><p>  Some worried about the unintended consequences of cracking down on tech's biggest companies.</p><p>  ''Any damage to the big companies would damage the whole economy,'' said Yesh Devabhaktuni, 25, who works as a software engineer for Walmart Labs. ''The small companies need the big companies.''</p><p>  Others moved here from around the world to work in the industry.</p><p>  ''Tech giants are where innovation is happening, and they offer a lot of jobs,'' said Fred Ren, 27, a software engineer who immigrated from Canada. ''I came here for that.''</p><p>  And some scoffed at the idea that start-ups could no longer compete.</p><p>  ''There's always opportunities for more start-ups,'' said Edmund Park, 28, a data scientist for a market research firm.</p><p>  The fire alarm technician walking by did not like it, either.</p><p>  '''Big Tech' is a big generalization,'' said Rick DeRushia, 58.</p><p>  Even a tech worker whose project was blocked by Google argued against breaking up the tech giants. Michael Plasmeier, 28, a product manager, had once worked on a home screen competitor that he says Google squeezed out.</p><p>  ''That product ended up not going anywhere, and, yeah, it was frustrating,'' Mr. Plasmeier said, adding that he still did not want to see the companies broken up. He said that because big tech firms often bought struggling start-ups, they played a vital role keeping the region's innovation machine going.</p><p>  Chuck Conlon, 44, who works as a sales and design consultant at HD Buttercup, the high-end furniture store the billboard is attached to, suggested the message might have more fans in a different part of the city. The Caltrain station is in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, home to scores of tech start-ups.</p><p>  ''This is an odd area to put it -- the whole area's all tech,'' Mr. Conlon said. ''But I guess she knew that?''</p><p>  But one of his colleagues, Megan Schmitz, 28, was enthusiastic about the message.</p><p>  ''What a badass,'' she said. ''I love it.''</p><p>  With the headlines seemingly always negative, some rank-and-file workers in the tech industry believe they are being unfairly demonized.</p><p>  Laura Grantham, 48, an engineering recruiter at the file-hosting service Dropbox, said that she was a fan of the senator but that the message was alienating.</p><p>  ''I know why she's saying that, but I feel like if you just only saw that billboard you'd be like, 'Oh, wow, Elizabeth Warren really hates us,''' Ms. Grantham said.</p><p>  But others recognized points in American history when the federal government intervened to break up powerful companies.</p><p>  ''Out here, people write this rhetoric off as absurd, that it's never going to happen, but that's because they're ignoring history,'' said Collins Belton, 28, a lawyer at the tech law firm Atrium. ''The oil barons did the same thing.''</p><p>  This is not Ms. Warren's first time going straight to tech people to say tech is too powerful. In March, she detailed her argument to the audience of South by Southwest, or SXSW, a technology and music festival in Texas.</p><p>  ''You can be an umpire or you can own teams,'' Ms. Warren said. ''But you can't be an umpire and own one of the teams that's in the game.''</p><p>  On Saturday, while she was in town for the state's Democratic convention, Ms. Warren visited the billboard. She took a selfie underneath it.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren's </nameText></person>campaign billboard is near the train station many use to commute to Silicon Valley.

PHOTO: Elizabeth Frantz/New York Times</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is bidding to be the policy pacesetter in the Democratic presidential primary, announced another expansive idea Friday: a regulatory plan aimed at breaking up some of America's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook. The proposal calls for the appointment of regulators who would \"unwind tech mergers that illegally undermine competition,\" as well as legislation that would prohibit platforms from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace. </p><p>Warren's plan also would force the rollback of some acquisitions by technological giants, the campaign said, including Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's addition of Whole Foods, and Google's purchase of Waze. Companies would be barred from transferring or sharing users' data with third parties. Dual entities, such as Amazon Marketplace and AmazonBasics, would be split apart. \"I want a government that makes sure everybody - even the biggest and most powerful companies in America - plays by the rules,\" Warren said in a statement. \"To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\" During a brief interview later in New York, Warren refused to say whether Gov. Andrew Cuomo was right to have offered hefty tax incentives to Amazon in return for the proposed campus in Queens. Boston Mayor Martin Walsh, from Warren's home state, also offered similar incentives. \"That's not the point,\" she said. \"Before you even get into the question of do you need to change the statutes, there are structural changes you can make in the economy to prevent Amazon from dancing its way across America saying, 'What will you offer me if I came?'\" The announcement reverberated Friday from New York to Silicon Valley. Pressure for elected officials to place additional oversight on mega-tech companies has been building for months, particularly after revelations that companies such as Facebook may have violated customer privacy agreements. Warren is also sending a political warning shot across the Democratic primary field, where decisions on how much to embrace or reject Silicon Valley and its wealthy donors could become an important dividing line among candidates. In the wide-open nomination race, Democrats such as Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have expressed a willingness to limit the influence of companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - though Sanders and Klobuchar have yet to present clear policy details. Sen. Kamala Harris, who represents many of those companies based in her home state of California, has repeatedly pressed executives on consumer privacy but has stayed away from direct calls to limit their influence. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has been more willing to embrace the controversial corporations, who have frequently used their vast resources to lobby politicians of both parties. Warren's plan creates two tiers of companies that would fall under the new regulations: those that have an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more, and those with annual revenue of $90 million to $25 billion. The upper tier would be required to \"structurally separate\" their products from their marketplace. Smaller companies would be subject to regulations but would not be forced to separate themselves from the online marketplace.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SANTEX-MERLIN65147023</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANTEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-TCW1-JC8S-D1DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">168424</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"591\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren, a presidential hopeful, announced Friday she wants to bust up giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America's first Gilded Age began in the late 19th century with a raft of innovations - railroads, steel production, oil extraction - but culminated in mammoth trusts run by \"robber barons\" such as J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller and William H. (\"The public be damned!\") Vanderbilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer then was to bust up the railroad, oil and steel monopolies.</p><p>We're now in a second Gilded Age - ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet - that has spawned a handful of high-tech behemoths and a new set of barons such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page.</p><p>The answer now is the same: Bust up the monopolies.</p><p>The current effort is bipartisan. At a Senate hearing I testified at last week, arch-conservative Missouri Republican Josh Hawley asked me, rhetorically, \"Is there really any wonder that there is increased pressure for antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity when these companies behave in the way that they do?\"</p><p>Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google. Facebook and Google together account for 58 percent of all digital ads (where most ad money goes these days).</p><p>They're also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online). Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything.</p><p>Google uses the world's most widely used search engine to promote its own services and content over those of competitors. Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram killed off two potential rivals.</p><p>Contrary to the conventional view of America as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau.</p><p>Such size also confers political power to get whatever these companies and their top executives want.</p><p>Amazon, the richest corporation in America, paid nothing in federal taxes last year. Meanwhile, it's holding an auction to extort billions from states and cities eager to have its second headquarters.</p><p>Facebook withheld evidence of Russian activity on its platform far longer than previously disclosed. When the news came to light, the company hired an  opposition research firm to discredit critics.</p><p>The New America Foundation, an influential think tank Google helped fund, fired researchers who were urging antitrust officials to take on the company. And Google has been quietly financing hundreds of professors to write research papers justifying Google's  dominance.</p><p>What to do? Some argue that the tech mammoths should be regulated like utilities or common carriers, but this would put government in the impossible position of policing content and overseeing new products and services.</p><p>A better alternative is to break them up. </p><p>Like the robber barons of the first Gilded Age, those of the second have amassed fortunes that gave them unparalleled influence over politicians and the economy.</p><p>The combined wealth of Zuckerberg ($62.3 billion), Bezos ($131 billion), Brin ($49.8 billion) and Page ($50.8 billion) is larger than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population.</p><p>A wealth tax (also proposed by Warren) would help.</p><p>Some of the robber barons of the first Gilded Age were generous philanthropists, as are today's. That didn't excuse the damage they did to America.</p><p>Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists. In this new Gilded Age, we need to respond to them as forcefully as we did the first time around. Warren's ideas are a good start.</p><p>Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNCLN-MC0092531091</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MRNCLL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN1-HWW1-DY37-F1K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capital Gazette Communications, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren is right to call for more aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws in our new digital era. Google and Facebook particularly deserve greater scrutiny from U.S. regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Washington voters should follow closely, however, because the tech giants Warren called out - Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook - are responsible for a large share of the state's recent job growth and increased tax revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren, a consumer advocate and former law professor, is well qualified to start this conversation. But she may be squandering the opportunity. Her antitrust treatise, posted last week, seems designed to stoke resentment of big companies as much as protect consumers. It sets an arbitrary \u00a0threshold on revenues of big tech companies, above which they are prohibited from selling products that use their platform. This could raise prices and stifle innovation, because services help cover the cost of investing in cloud services.</p><p>Breaking these companies up \u00a0is likely to cause massive price increases or losses in quality, said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania. This would be particularly painful for Warren's Democratic working-class constituents who earn less and are more sensitive to price increases, he noted.</p><p>While it may play well with her activist labor base, demonizing popular companies like Amazon won't always fly with voters. This was demonstrated last year in deep blue Seattle, where City Hall killed its \"Amazon tax\" on jobs only after labor polling found widespread public opposition to the measure.</p><p>The timing of Warren's attack on mergers is significant. She's part of a last-ditch, labor-affiliated effort to scuttle the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US, a deal expected to bring enormous benefits to Washington.</p><p>Disappointingly, U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, has joined with Warren and other left-leaning members of Congress in opposing the deal, even though it's expected to preserve jobs held by many of Jayapal's constituents, create thousands of new jobs and prevent the loss of the Seattle area's last major telecom company.</p><p>Jayapal \u00a0was unavailable to comment. But she recently co-signed a letter, leaning on research by the Communications Workers of America, opposing a \"deal designed to destroy jobs and drive down wages, hurting American workers and consumers and threatening our economy.\"</p><p>T-Mobile's merger would combine the third- and fourth-place wireless companies to create a stronger competitor for the giants, Verizon and AT&amp;T. T-Mobile also plans to use Sprint's spectrum to push into home broadband, creating new competition for Comcast and other broadband providers.</p><p>Although T-Mobile isn't unionized, the company has benefited working people by driving down wireless prices. It's forcing larger carriers to offer more affordable wireless options to compete with its aggressive pricing.\u00a0Some sort of merger is all but inevitable.</p><p>T-Mobile's Bellevue headquarters is in the congressional district of another progressive, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith. He said the merger \"holds great promise for our region's workers and local economy.</p><p>\"If approved by regulators, I expect this merger to promote greater competition within the wireless industry; benefiting the Puget Sound area through the preservation and growth of jobs as well as our country's wireless customers through innovation and competition,\" Smith said in a statement.</p><p>Also supporting the merger is U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, a \u00a0Medina Democrat whose district includes many T-Mobile employees. \"Even combined, T-Mobile and Sprint will still be number three in terms of market,\" she noted.</p><p>Politicians calling for antitrust enforcement and stronger regulation of the internet's dominant gatekeepers are more than welcome. Especially if they avoid grandstanding and focus on truly protecting consumers and increasing competition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-a8f97ba8443c11e9b277c841c3af2eab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-V2D1-DY2P-43JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001XSU</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

HERNDON</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>the Massachusetts Democrat who is bidding to be the policy pacesetter in the Democratic presidential primary, championed another expansive idea on Friday evening in front of a crowd of thousands in Queens: a regulatory plan aimed at breaking up some of America's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a rally in Long Island City, the neighborhood that was to be home to a major new Amazon campus, Ms. Warren laid out her proposal calling for regulators who would undo some tech mergers, as well as legislation that would prohibit platforms from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''We have these giants corporations -- do I have to tell that to people in Long Island City? -- that think they can roll over everyone,'' Ms. Warren told the crowd, drawing applause. She compared Amazon to the dystopian novel ''The Hunger Games,'' in which those with power force their wishes on the less fortunate.</p><p>  ''I'm sick of freeloading billionaires,'' she said.</p><p>  Ms. Warren's policy announcement sent reverberations from New York to Silicon Valley, as she further cemented herself as one of the Democratic candidates most willing to call for large-scale changes to the country's structure in the name of equality.</p><p>  Among the crowded field of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, Ms. Warren has done the most to add detail to those early proposals, including a plan for universal child care, a tax on the country's wealthiest families, and, as of Friday, breaking up big technological giants.</p><p>  Ms. Warren's regulatory plan would also force the rollback of some acquisitions by tech giants, the campaign said, including Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's addition of Whole Foods, and Google's purchase of Waze. Companies would be barred from transferring or sharing users' data with third parties. Dual entities, such as Amazon Marketplace and AmazonBasics, would be split apart.</p><p>  [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]</p><p>  Pressure for elected officials to place additional oversight on mega-tech companies has been building for months, particularly after revelations that companies such as Facebook may have violated customer privacy agreements. Ms. Warren is also sending a political warning shot across the Democratic primary field, where decisions on how much to embrace or reject Silicon Valley and its wealthy donors could become an important dividing line among candidates.</p><p>  In the wide-open nomination race, Democrats such as Ms. Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have expressed a willingness to limit the influence of companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon -- though Mr. Sanders and Ms. Klobuchar have yet to present clear policy details. Senator <person><nameText>Kamala Harris, </nameText></person>who represents many of those companies based in her home state of California, has repeatedly pressed executives on consumer privacy but has stayed away from direct calls to limit their influence. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has been more willing to embrace the controversial corporations, who have frequently used their vast resources to lobby politicians of both parties.</p><p>  ''Our technology industry is the envy of the world and we need policies that will foster innovation and consumer choice -- but we also need stronger enforcement of antitrust law,'' said Ro Khanna, the California House Democrat who represents Silicon Valley headquarters of companies such as Apple and eBay. He said that blanket statements against big tech companies weren't helpful, but that each company needed to be ''evaluated on a case-by-case basis and afforded due process.''</p><p>  [Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]</p><p>  Ms. Warren's plan creates two tiers of companies that would fall under the new regulations: those that have an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more, and those with annual revenue of $90 million to $25 billion. The upper tier would be required to ''structurally separate'' their products from their marketplace. Smaller companies would be subject to regulations but would not be forced to separate themselves from the online marketplace.</p><p>  Ms. Warren, who has previously said moving to Boston would have been a ''good opportunity'' for Amazon, said in a Medium post Friday morning that companies have grown so powerful that they can bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business, and can act -- in the words of Mark Zuckerberg -- ''more like a government than a traditional company.''</p><p>  During a brief interview later in New York, Ms. Warren refused to say whether Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was right to have offered hefty tax incentives to Amazon in return for the proposed campus in Queens. Boston's mayor, Martin J. Walsh, from Ms. Warren's home state, also offered similar incentives.</p><p>  ''That's not the point,'' she said. ''Before you even get into the question of do you need to change the statutes, there are structural changes you can make in the economy to prevent Amazon from dancing its way across America saying, 'What will you offer me if I came?'''</p><p>  This is a refrain she has hit for years, including in a 2016 speech titled ''Reigniting Competition in the American Economy.'' Last year, she introduced the Accountable Capitalism Act, which seeks to curb shareholder power by forcing corporations to increase worker representation on their governing boards, while also reducing incentives for big companies to pay out shareholders rather than reinvest in businesses.</p><p>  Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute in Washington and a former senior adviser to the Senate Budget Committee, said Ms. Warren's plan was ''practical'' and ''necessary.'' He compared big tech companies to the tobacco monopolies of America's past, which were eventually subjected to antitrust lawsuits.</p><p>  ''There's been a traditional sense around the politics of D.C. that these companies are progressive,'' Mr. Stoller said. ''Their employees give to Democrats, they're friendly to social liberalism, there's an idealism to how they talk about the world. That's been the traditional sense.''</p><p>  ''But these companies have the moral frame of Big Tobacco,'' he added. ''They don't care.''</p><p>  Carl Szabo, who is vice president at an e-commerce trade association called NetChoice, said he felt Ms. Warren's plan was unnecessary. He warned that it could lead to weaponization of antitrust laws, as legislators target companies deemed to be their enemies.</p><p>  ''Politicizing and weaponizing antitrust law is ripe for abuse,'' said Mr. Szabo, who is a professor of privacy law at George Mason University's law school. ''We've already seen how politics can inject itself into antitrust reviews, and I don't think our legislators should be encouraging this precedent.''</p><p>  Though tech giants have experienced several controversies in recent years, it is unclear how popular Ms. Warren's antitrust proposal would be with voters. Rob Atkinson, president of Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, an industry-sponsored group, defended the power of big companies in the technology sector for what he described as benefits to consumers.</p><p>  ''The Warren campaign's call to break up big tech companies reflects a 'big is bad, small is beautiful' ideology run amok,'' Mr. Atkinson said. ''The proposal ignores the fact that many of the services big tech companies now provide free used to cost consumers money.''</p><p>  Matt McIlwain, a partner at the Seattle venture capital firm Madrona Venture Group, which was an early Amazon investor, said in an email, ''Senator Warren and others with a similar mind-set are misguided on the need to break up larger tech companies.''</p><p>  ''Companies in the innovation economy have a strong track record of creating quality products and services that are often free or at dramatically lower costs than previous services,'' Mr. McIlwain said.</p><p>  For those closely watching the Democratic presidential nomination contest, the announcement was another example of Ms. Warren's political strategy, which is to appeal to voters based on policy ideas and retail politics, not soaring oration or feel-good messages of unity.</p><p>  Among the crowd in Queens, which included more young people than many Warren rallies across the country, several said they appreciated her policy focus.</p><p>  ''The fact that she focuses on concrete policy, this early in the race, is really aspirational,'' said Milo Vassallo, who is involved in several Brooklyn leftist groups. Mr. Vassallo said he particularly liked Ms. Warren's new proposal on technology.</p><p>  ''Her goal is not to undermine big tech, but just make it more competitive,'' he said.</p><p>  Kevin Murray, a 28-year-old law student who lives in Queens and who has not decided on a candidate to support, praised Ms. Warren's proposals as ''tangible.'' Mr. Murray also wanted to come to the rally because Ms. Warren is the author of one of his law school textbooks.</p><p>  ''I would've brought it for her to sign,'' he said, ''but it was a rental.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>a Democratic candidate for president, told a rally Friday night in Queens, ''I'm sick of freeloading billionaires.''

If elected, she said her administration would first support legislation to ban platforms from owning their own separate businesses on those platforms.</p><p>\"Amazon Marketplace, Google's ad exchange, and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law,\" she wrote. \"Therefore, Amazon Marketplace and Basics, and Google's ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. Google Search would have to be spun off as well.\"</p><p>Second, Warren said she would appoint regulators \"committed\" to reversing prior mergers, including Amazon's acquisitions of Zappos and Whole Foods Market, Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's acquisitions of Nest, DoubleClick, and Waze.</p><p>Google and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Warren's proposal.

She makes a case for stiffer anti-trust regulation based on the Microsoft Department of Justice battle in the 1990s. Warren writes:</p><p>The federal government sued Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws and eventually reached a settlement. The government`s antitrust case against Microsoft helped clear a path for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge.</p><p>That argument is a bit debatable given that Google and Facebook both arrived years later.</p><p>But the meat of Warren`s treatise gets more interesting. The highlights:</p><p>Mergers are limiting competition. Warren cites Amazon`s acquisition of Diapers.com and Zappos as anticompetitive. She also targets Google`s purchase of DoubleClick and Nest.</p><p>Proprietary marketplaces limit competition. She argues that Amazon crushes small businesses and copies their wares. We`ll overlook the fact that Amazon also gives smaller vendors distribution they wouldn`t have had otherwise with the exception of eBay.</p><p>Platform utilities need to be regulated and Warren outlined a revenue cap of sorts. She wrote:</p><p>Companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as \"platform utilities.\"</p><p>These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.</p><p>What`s the problem? Where Warren`s platform utility argument may run into problems is her broad definition. Based on her definition platform utilities would extend well beyond Google, Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>For instance, Salesforce has an app marketplace and a platform connecting third parties and will hit $25 billion in revenue. What about Microsoft? Is LinkedIn a problem for Microsoft that could be reversed? How about SAP with its Ariba platform? \"Connecting third parties\" could equate to any company that rustles up a platform via application programming interfaces.</p><p>Warren continued:</p><p>Amazon Marketplace, Google`s ad exchange, and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law. Therefore, Amazon Marketplace and Basics, and Google`s ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. Google Search would have to be spun off as well.</p><p>She added that her plan would reverse Amazon`s purchase of Whole Foods as well as Facebook`s WhatsApp and Instagram purchases. Google would say so long to Waze and DoubleClick.</p><p>What`s interesting here is that the reversals are based on hindsight. Amazon didn`t have grocery operations when it bought Whole Foods. You`d need a crystal ball to find something anti-competitive. Has Google really done much with Nest? On the bright side, maybe Warren could have saved Google from itself and forbid it from buying Motorola, which was later unloaded to Lenovo. 2019 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UTIMON-139933991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UTIMON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM5-C7R1-F11P-X0PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Global Data Point.

HERNDON New York Times Service</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is bidding to be the policy pacesetter in the Democratic presidential primary, announced another expansive idea Friday: a regulatory plan aimed at breaking up some of America's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook.</p><p>The proposal -- which comes on the same day Warren will hold a  rally in Long Island City, the New York neighborhood that was to be  home to a major new Amazon campus -- calls for the appointment of  regulators who would \"unwind tech mergers that illegally undermine  competition,\" as well as legislation that would prohibit platforms  from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in  that marketplace.</p><p> Warren's plan would also force the rollback of some  acquisitions by technological giants, the campaign said, including  Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's addition of  Whole Foods, and Google's purchase of Waze. Companies would be  barred from transferring or sharing users' data with third parties.  Dual entities, such as Amazon Marketplace and Amazon-Basics, would  be split apart.</p><p> \"I want a government that makes sure everybody -- even the  biggest and most powerful companies in America -- plays by the  rules,\" Warren said in a statement. \"To do that, we need to stop  this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their  political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing  around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential  competitor.\"</p><p> During a brief interview later in New York, Warren refused to  say whether Gov. Andrew Cuomo was right to have offered hefty tax  incentives to Amazon in return for the proposed campus in Queens.  Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, from Warren's home state, also  offered similar incentives.</p><p> \"That's not the point,\" she said. \"Before you even get into the  question of do you need to change the statutes, there are  structural changes you can make in the economy to prevent Amazon  from dancing its way across America saying, 'What will you offer me  if I came?'\"</p><p> The announcement reverberated Friday from New York to Silicon  Valley. Pressure for elected officials to place additional  oversight on mega-tech companies has been building for months,  particularly after revelations that companies such as Facebook may  have violated customer privacy agreements. Warren is also sending a  political warning shot across the Democratic primary field, where  decisions on how much to embrace or reject Silicon Valley and its  wealthy donors could become an important dividing line among  candidates.</p><p> In the wide-open nomination race, Democrats such as Warren,  Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  have expressed a willingness to limit the influence of companies  such as Face-book, Google, Apple and Amazon -- though Sanders and  Klobuchar have yet to present clear policy details. Sen. Kamala  Harris, who represents many of those companies based in her home  state of California, has repeatedly pressed executives on consumer  privacy but has stayed away from direct calls to limit their  influence. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has been more willing to  embrace the controversial corporations, who have frequently used  their vast resources to lobby politicians of both parties.</p><p> \"Our technology industry is the envy the world, and we need  policies that will foster innovation and consumer choice -- but we  also need stronger enforcement of antitrust law,\" said Ro Khanna,  the California House Democrat who represents Silicon Valley  headquarters of companies such as Apple and eBay. He said blanket  statements against big tech companies weren't helpful, but that  each company needs to be \"evaluated on a case-by-case basis and  afforded due process.\"</p><p> Warren's plan creates two tiers of companies that would fall  under the new regulations: those that have an annual global revenue  of $25 billion or more, and those with annual revenue of $90  million to $25 billion. The upper tier would be required to  \"structurally separate\" their products from their marketplace.  Smaller companies would be subject to regulations but would not be  forced to separate themselves from the online marketplace.</p><p> Warren, who has previously said moving to Boston would have  been a \"good opportunity\" for Amazon, said in a Medium post Friday  morning that companies have grown so powerful that they can bully  cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer  handouts in exchange for doing business, and can act -- in the  words of Mark Zuckerberg -- \"more like a government than a  traditional company.\"</p><p> Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute in  Washington and a former senior adviser to the Senate Budget  Committee, said Warren's plan was \"practical\" and \"necessary.\" He  compared big tech companies to the tobacco monopolies of America's  past, which were eventually subjected to antitrust lawsuits.</p><p> \"There's been a traditional sense around the politics of D.C.  that these companies are progressive,\" Stoller said. \"Their  employees give to Democrats, they're friendly to social liberalism,  there's an idealism to how they talk about the world. That's been  the traditional sense.</p><p> \"But these companies have the moral frame of Big Tobacco,\" he  added. \"They don't care.\"</p><p> Carl Szabo, who is vice president at an e-commerce trade  association called NetChoice, said he felt Warren's plan was  unnecessary. He warned that it could lead to weaponization of  antitrust laws, as legislators target companies deemed to be their  enemies.</p><p> \"Politicizing and weaponizing antitrust law is ripe for abuse,\"  said Szabo, who is a professor of privacy law at George Mason  University's law school. \"We've already seen how politics can  inject itself into antitrust reviews, and I don't think our  legislators should be encouraging this precedent.\"</p><p> He added that he also felt Warren is \"wrong in her assertion  that tech markets lack competition.\"</p><p> \"Never before have consumers and workers had more access to  goods, services and opportunities online,\" Szabo said.</p><p> In the announcement, Warren's team included praise from several  scholars on internet privacy and technology regulation, including  Siva Vaidhyanathan from the University of Virginia and Frank  Pasquale of the University of Maryland's School of Law. For those  closely watching the Democratic presidential nomination contest,  the announcement was another example of Warren's political  strategy, which is to appeal to voters based on policy ideas and  retail politics, not soaring oration or feel-good messages of  unity.</p><p> In January, Faiz Shakir, then national political director for  the American Civil Liberties Union, said, \"Elizabeth Warren is  trying to position herself as the ideas candidate of the field, and  thus far, in the early going, she's winning that.\"</p><p> \"Others should start thinking about competing in the arena for  new ideas,\" Shakir added. He has since joined Sanders' presidential  bid as its campaign manager.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGAZ-DLYGAZ20190309Ar01901</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGAZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKS-C2M1-JBCN-43M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388131</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1175\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Gazette Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren's plan to break up Amazon, Facebook and Google is a long shot, but it ensures that Big Tech's influence will be an issue during the 2020 presidential primary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Privacy Pitfalls: Lawmakers and Silicon Valley mostly agree that a strong federal data privacy law is essential, but the difficulties in getting there are considerable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. Fretting Over Fintech: State regulators who enforce laws designed to protect consumers from the risks of new financial technologies are worried that Congress may pre-empt them. </p><p>4. Equifax Equanimity: CEO Mark Begor apologized to senators for the company's massive 2017 data breach but said the hack is not proof that Equifax failed to take cybersecurity seriously. </p><p>5. Lord of the Files: The Democrats' chief security officer says one of the hardest parts of his job is training campaign volunteers to adopt basic cybersecurity practices.</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Warren Proposes Breaking Up Big Tech Firms</p><p>If Facebook, Amazon and Google still held any hope of flying under the radar for the duration of the 2020 presidential campaign, Sen. Elizabeth Warren just clipped their wings.</p><p>The Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate on Friday laid out an ambitious plan to break up the three massive technology companies by passing legislation that would ban them from also owning companies that operate on their platforms and would appoint regulators committed to reversing some of their most high-profile acquisitions, such as Facebook's mergers with Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>The proposal is the latest sign that growing public concern with the manner in which so-called Big Tech firms have increased their hold on numerous sectors of the economy -- and how they have handled Americans' data -- will feature in the upcoming presidential primary.</p><p>\"Elizabeth Warren is really driving the policy debate among the 2020 candidates,\" tweeted Jon Favreau, former speechwriter for President Barack Obama and co-host of the influential liberal podcast Pod Save America. \"It's impressive.\"</p><p>Warren is not the first Democratic candidate to advocate greater oversight of Silicon Valley and a tougher approach to enforcing antitrust laws, but she is the first to propose a plan to actively break up the three companies.</p><p>Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book on antitrust called \"The Curse of Bigness,\" said on Twitter that \"after a year or two of beating the 'retroactive breakup' of tech idea (i.e., breakup Facebook into Instagram - WhatsApp - Facebook) it is heartening to see it gain some traction in the 2020 race.\"</p><p>Read my full report on Warren's proposal here.</p><p>2. Broad Support for Federal Privacy Law Doesn't Guarantee Passage</p><p>SAN FRANCISCO  -  Lawmakers want to pass a federal data privacy bill before 2020 to put Washington on par with Europe and ahead of several U.S. states. But those efforts could be delayed because of differences between technology companies and Congress on how powerful a national law should be and how it should be structured. </p><p>A delay in enacting a uniform federal law could leave technology giants and startup app makers trying to meet a lattice work of standards set by multiple regulations passed by states, as well as a growing international set of rules being modeled after the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Companies also could be liable for fines and face consumer lawsuits allowed by state laws. </p><p>The cost and complexity of complying with such a regulatory system was one of the hot topics at the annual RSA Conference in San Francisco last week, which brought together more than 40,000 security and privacy experts. While hundreds of vendor booths filled a cavernous hall in the Moscone Center, venue speakers discussed minutiae of GDPR compliance and preparing for California's Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which becomes effective in January 2020.</p><p>Although most technology companies agree that a strong federal law governing the collection and use of consumers' data is essential, how to get there is still being debated. </p><p>At a hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee last month, trade groups representing technology companies strongly backed a federal law that would pre-empt or override state privacy laws like CCPA. Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., told reporters he would like the legislation to pass before the end of 2019. </p><p>But overruling state laws may not be easy. California's Attorney General Xavier Becerra has warned that weak federal legislation should not be the basis for nullifying his state's law.</p><p>Read more from CQ's Gopal Ratnam, who spent last week reporting from the RSA security conference in San Francisco, here. </p><p>3.  Regulators Warn Congress Not to Pre-Empt State Fintech Rules</p><p>State laws to protect consumers from the risks of new financial technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies should not be pre-empted by Congress, state securities regulators say.</p><p>The North American Securities Administrators Association on Wednesday issued its legislative priorities for the 116th Congress, calling on lawmakers to be cautious when implementing fintech laws.</p><p>\"Investor protections must not be diminished at the state or federal levels for the sake of potential yet unproven innovation in the financial services industry,\" NASAA said in a statement. \"Congress should, therefore, refrain from preempting any protections afforded to investors under state law.\"</p><p>NASAA said it is concerned about congressional involvement in a number of fintech areas, including cryptocurrency and initial coin offerings, which are digital tokens that may be issued to raise money to build new software applications or as future credit for a company's product or service. Congress needs to conduct rigorous oversight of potential fraud in the cryptocurrency market, it said.</p><p>\"Scams in this marketplace were the subject of numerous coordinated state enforcement actions in 2018, and the risk in this area is not receding,\" NASAA said. Congress should require the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide guidance about the treatment of ICOs to limit risk to investors, it said.</p><p>Read more from CQ's Clyde McGrady here. </p><p>4. Equifax CEO Apologizes for 2017's Massive Data Breach</p><p>Mark Begor, CEO of Equifax, told a Senate panel Thursday that he \"deeply\" regrets the 2017 data breach that affected around 145 million Americans, even as he insisted that the breach \"doesn't mean that the company failed to take cybersecurity seriously.\"</p><p>Begor's apology before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations came a day after the release of a bipartisan report from the panel that found that the company, one of the nation's largest consumer reporting companies that monitors credit scores and other personal data, failed to properly secure customer information and maintain best-practice cybersecurity standards for years prior to the breach.</p><p>The company's response to the breach was \"inadequate and hampered by Equifax's neglect of cybersecurity,\" the report said. \"Equifax's shortcomings are long-standing and reflect a broader culture of complacency toward cybersecurity preparedness.\"</p><p>The report also criticized Equifax for waiting six weeks to publicly disclose the breach after it was discovered.</p><p>Finally, the report suggested that Congress pass legislation establishing a national cybersecurity standard for private companies that collect and maintain customers' personally identifiable information, noting that current laws do not require the private sector to comply with the framework set forth by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p><p>Begor testified on Thursday alongside Arne M. Sorenson, CEO of Marriott International Inc., which last November revealed that hackers had access to its internal systems for four years, exposing the details of around 500 million customers.</p><p>Read my full dispatch from the hearing here. </p><p>5. One Pitfall Threatening Election Security? Untrained Volunteers</p><p>Bob Lord, the chief security officer at the Democratic National Committee, who last month published a one-page cybersecurity checklist, said training campaign volunteers to adopt basic security practices is one of the most challenging aspects of his job.</p><p>In many cases, Lord said, he found that elderly volunteers and others hadn't updated software on their phones because the device had a large number of photos and videos that took up memory. In other cases, people believed that updating software on their phones would open their devices to new viruses or that an update only added new emojis that they didn't really want.</p><p>Basic \"security is still very confusing to people,\" Lord said at the RSA Conference. \"People are frustrated when you tell them to save their photos and videos so they can update the software.\"</p><p>Software updates typically are intended to address bugs and other previously unaddressed weaknesses in an operating system that could be exploited by hackers. Once a software update has been published it becomes a roadmap for hackers and devices that haven't installed the new software version.</p><p>Software makers and technology companies are at fault for not making security a default part of their design and making it complicated for users by using a wide variety of terminology, said Lord, who previously worked at Twitter, AOL and Netscape. The DNC hired him in early 2018 after catastrophic security breaches in 2016 that helped cost them the presidential election.</p><p>Google's Chrome browser is one of the few applications where security updates seem less complicated, Lord said. When an update is ready, the browser prompts users with a little green arrow on the top that when clicked simply reboots the browser with a new version while retaining all active tabs.</p><p>Technology companies don't reward their employees for making existing users more secure; instead, incentives are designed to attract newer users, Lord said.</p><p>-- Gopal Ratnam</p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

Against many expectations, as Washington correspondent Cameron Stewart reported on Thursday, the \"progressive\" Senator Warren, from Massachusetts, has surged in the polls to a point where she is challenging one-time vice-president Joe Biden as frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. It's a fair bet the party's other candidates are nervous about the prospect of her being the standard-bearer to fight Mr Trump in an election that RealClearPolitics polls show is potentially winnable by the Democrats.</p><p>They have reason to be anxious. As vulnerable as the US President may appear, Senator Warren's targeting by fellow candidates reflects the depth of the divisions that exist within the Democratic Party over how to take on Mr Trump when the US economy is, as most economists agree, doing well. Time and again her fellow candidates demanded to know how Senator Warren would fund promises barely distinguishable from those of the openly declared socialist senator Bernie Sanders. They were right to do so. Senator Warren has co-opted more or less all of Senator Sanders's big policy proposals while deliberately seeking to disavow a socialist label. As the race for the nomination heats up it is imperative she be held to account over her expansive promises that, if elected next November, she would remake US capitalism from the ground up, starting with her insistence bankers are crooks, \"Wall Street is looting the economy\", and workers should get 40 per cent of the seats on boards of big corporations.</p><p>Like Senator Sanders, Senator Warren is fully committed to Medicare for All, including an end to private insurance, though she dissembles and obfuscates over the inevitable tax rises to raise the $US32 trillion ($48 trillion) needed to fund it over a decade. Mr Trump's tax cuts, which demonstrably have done so much to spur business investment in the US, including that by Australian companies such as Visy, would be reversed. There would be a 3 per cent \"wealth tax\", a new 7 per cent tax on profits and a 14.8 per cent tax on incomes above $US250,000. Student debt would be cancelled, public colleges and universities would be tuition-free, a ban on shale drilling for natural gas and oil would be imposed, and a promise of net zero carbon emissions in the US within 10 years would be enforced. A President Warren would seek to regulate big tech companies and break up major banks, all the time declaring herself to be \"a capitalist to my bones\".It may be that if she secures the Democratic nomination or the White House Senator Warren will temper her extremism and track towards the centre. Many business leaders believe few of her signature policy initiatives would be enacted because congress or the courts would stop them in their tracks. Her fellow candidates should be demanding answers. Even Senator Sanders has questioned her integrity. \"There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,\" he said in an interview. \"Elizabeth has said she is a capitalist through her bones. I'm not.\" No wonder Mr Trump, despite current polling, sees her possible nomination as his best chance to defeat the Democrats and win a second term.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-de999fe4f09011e99d70460943e0caa2c14bf9e8d17a4e52febf954b761e2dca</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X94-5001-JD3N-51SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"573\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001S8A</classCode><className>FORBES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC2721 PERIODICALS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

In a rather lengthy written address[1] describing the basic gist of her plans, Senator Warren openly stated: \"it's time to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.\" The 69-year-old vowed to pursue dismantling the largest tech companies in the country if she wins the presidency, with the move being a mostly unprecedented affair that could push the traditionally left-wing Silicon Valley more to the right, or at least eliminate the will to vote among many Californians if they feel no one is representing their interests on a national level. </p><p>Fear of unstoppable conglomerates isn't particularly partisan Senator Warren's Friday address saw her call for Internet juggernauts such as Google and Facebook to be regulated like utilities, being burdened by a much broader range of regulations and heavier oversight than what they currently face in any segment, despite the fact they're present and active in essentially every industry. The idea, while somewhat controversial, has been floated around top Washington decision-makers in the past, according to previous reports. While some GOP-leaning pundits are now likely to start attacking the concept as radically left-wing, it is President Donal Trump's formerChief Strategist Steve Bannon[2] who was last said to have subscribed to such a way of thinking, some 18 months back. The big tech naturally opposes the idea of having to worry about the same regulations that are being imposed on wireless carriers and broadband service providers; the two are likely to become one and the same with the advent o 5G, while both Google and Amazon have recently been experimenting with millimeter-frequency spectrum. Google itself is already a network operator in a sense, with its Google Fi project still going strong despite hiccups. Both manage vast ecosystems of products and services where they aren't just taking a cut of every transaction but are also selling their own competing foods. Stories of Amazon forcing small suppliers out of business aren't the rarest of sights on the World Wide Web, yet few industries can afford to refuse to deal with the Seattle, Washington-based firm, even if doing so means risking having it take away one's business by first buying up all in-stock goods, then selling them en masse while aggressively driving down their prices. Google's antitrust issues need little introduction; the company alone is the holder of several world records[3] for highest penalties imposed over any competitionlaw violations, many of which aren't older than two years. A Democrat against big tech Then there' Facebook, what many describe as a growing monopoly in its own right whose original platform is now stagnating but that's adamant on buying up anything that has even the slightest of chances of becoming the next big thing - the next MySpace, FacebookTwitter, or YouTube. Senator Warren wants to see all of those companies prevented from simultaneously owning massive e-commerce platforms and selling through them, with the draft of her plan drawing the line on a $25-billion valuation. Should she win the 2020 candidacy during the DNC's primaries, Senator Warren could be the first Democratic presidential candidate in what seems like forever that wouldn't enjoy strongpolitical (and hence - financial) support from the Silicon Valley.

Produced by Economy for All[1], a project of the Independent Media Institute Senator Elizabeth Warren made national headlines with her recently released plans to break up tech giants[2] Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple, making it one of her signature proposals as she campaigns for the presidency. The notion should resonate and echo in our political memory\u2014Teddy Roosevelt made his name as the trust-buster, for going after the great monopolies of the early 20th century in the name of the public interest. Twenty-first-century populist economics in America continues to be adorned the century-old piece of political syntax, 'break 'em up.' </p><p>Warren's essential rationale is that these tech companies act as monopolies and need to be cut down in size in order to promote more competitive markets, via traditional antitrust instruments such as the Sherman Act. Furthermore, as legal scholar Kelsey Mullane highlights[3], Warren is also advocating 'new legislation that would regulate large tech platforms and the appointment of federal regulators who will enforce our antitrust laws and retroactively terminate anti-competitive mergers.' The premise is that increased competition via vigorous antitrust activity and more regulatory activism will act as a spur to additional innovation, as it levels the playing field between large and small businesses. Here is an even bigger goal implicit in Warren's call for an ambitious exercise of antitrust law. She wants to use it to address other social friction points, notably improving the quality of employment, mitigating wealth inequality, better protecting data privacy and enhancing national security. In short, her policies reflect an expansion of antitrust policy away from the narrow focus of the so-called 'Chicago School[4]' (which largely uses the metrics of economic efficiency and consumer welfare to determine whether to deploy antitrust remedies), toward broader philosophical concerns over monopoly's effects on democracy itself. The notion being that the atomization process of a highly concentrated industry sector is a moment where the market can be refashioned with more equitable rules of play to consumers, employees and stockholders. How do these proposals stack up? Elizabeth Warren is by no means the only presidential candidate to call for a breakup of big tech[5], but her proposals provide the most specificity in terms of what she aims to do. Her two most notable planks[6] boil down to this: Companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as 'platform utilities.' These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties. In other words, the rationale for the breakup of tech companies in part turns on 'structural separation,' as journalist David Dayen explains[7], which means that companies like Amazon or Google 'would not be allowed to both own the platform and also participate as a seller on that platform.' The idea behind this separation is that it prevents the companies from controlling content via control of distribution, which can create long-term competitive distortions, even though in the short term, consumers might benefit from the lower prices offered by a large-scale retailer like Amazon. This logic moves beyond book retailing: It is what gave America separation of ownership of movie studios and movie theaters before online streaming provided by Amazon and Netflix started taking over. Regulators,argues the legal scholar Lina Khan[8], 'cannot cognize the potential harms to competition posed by Amazon's dominance if we measure competition primarily through price and output. Specifically, current doctrine [which largely is governed by consumer welfare considerations] underappreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines may prove anticompetitive.' Fair enough. But it may still be useful to make a distinction between platforms for advertising and selling commercial goods (e.g., Amazon) and platforms for publication/speech/information (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). In the case of the former, the business models of these platforms depend on as many clicks or purchases as possible\u2014on size.The larger the better.Consequently, if a company like Amazon becomes too restrictive via predatory practices, it will begin to reduce the number of clicks and undermine the basis for its pricing model.This need for size means that there are some constraints on these platforms being able to favor their goods or listings over those of others but, as Khan and Warren would argue, probably not enough, which is why competition should be encouraged via antitrust. The problem with social media platforms that are publication or speech vehicles is somewhat different, as we are seeing with increasing censorship of some voices or viewpoints. It is unclear whether breaking up Facebook, and having multiple competing platforms, actually solves the problem of, say, dissemination of 'fake news.'FCC oversight and regulation would seem to be a better way of dealing with this issue. As far as the size metric itself goes, it's hard to understand the rationale for a cut-off point of $25 billion in global revenues as a prima facie reason to break up the tech giants. According to Dayen[9]:Warren's campaign sees the $25 billion figure as a clean way to assist regulators with pinpointing market dominance. 'It has the benefit of a clear rule,' said one senior campaign adviser, who was not authorized to speak on the record. 'We should presume if a company with over $25 billion in revenue is operating a marketplace, it has power and leverage.'But why should regulators make that sort of presumption in a globalized economy full of companies whose revenues vastly exceed that figure? Ford, GM, Toyota and countless other automobile manufacturers have global revenues well in excess of $25 billion. Seldom have we heard calls to break up Detroit's 'Big Three' despite global revenues in the hundreds of billions. Why? Because there is a widespread recognition that these companies are facing significant challenges in a global market dominated by similarly large competitors. Likewise with some of the global food companies, such as Unilever or Nestle. Or consider the pet food industry, which is largely dominated by three suppliers. Should we be breaking up 'Big Cat Food,' or is there something about a $25 billion global revenues metric that is intrinsic to Big Tech? By the same token, is it fair to make a presumption that businesses with much smaller revenues lack potentially abusive power and leverage? No question, it is fair game for Dayen to highlight the 'incestuous' linkages[10] between some of the institutes and think tanks that are broadly supportive of Big Tech and oppose the Warren proposals (such as the American Enterprise Institute). After all, they serve as intellectual advocates for the business models of companies such as Google. But beyond pointing out the potential conflicts of interest, it would be helpful to gain a better understanding of the global revenue metric beyond it simply having the virtue of clarity. There's nothing in the economic literature on antitrust that would provide any kind of empirical gauge to assess whether there is something sacrosanct about a $25 billion figure. In that sense, the figure adopted by Warren evokes the arbitrary limits[11]on debts and deficits established for fiscal sustainability rules in the European Monetary Union's so-called 'Stability and Growth Pact[12]' (which also have the 'virtue' of clarity, even though the rules themselves are devoid of economic common sense). In the same piece[13], Dayen writes:Andy Kessler at the Wall Street Journaldenied[14]that antitrust law has anything to do with bigness. The idea that John Sherman, author of the Sherman Antitrust Act, was not concerned with bigness would come as news to Sherman, whoonce said[15], 'If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.'In truth, however, the Sherman Act was conceived by its eponymous author in large part to avert more radical measures, as was noted by William Letwin in his seminal analysis of the Sherman Act, Law and Economic Policy in America[16]. Much as FDR conceived of the New Deal as rescue for capitalism rather than an embrace of socialism, Sherman introduced antitrust lest Congress pave the way 'for the socialist, the communist, and the nihilist.' In the words of antitrust law Professor Daniel Crane[17]: 'From the Sherman Act forward it is certain that antitrust has often been deployed as a foil to more interventionist forms of regulation. The ideological and political implications of that move are complex and not neatly housed in right/left categories.' Sherman and his fellow trust-busters (such as the Roosevelts) may have been unwilling to 'endure a king' over production, transportation, etc., but they were certainly willing to tolerate a number of archdukes. And here we come to the tension inherent in Warren's antitrust proposals. Is the ultimate goal to break up these companies in order to foster greater market competition? If so, to what end, or is it simply enough to let markets be markets, even if market forces lend themselves precisely to the kinds of pathologies that Warren is seeking to eliminate? As far as outcomes go, there is a benign assumption in the Warren proposals that increased competition levels the playing field between large and small businesses, which in turn helps to spur greater innovation. However, there is a significant body of research since the days of Joseph Schumpeter[18] (the intellectual godfather of the economics of innovation) indicating that R...pending and R...roductivity increase with scale. True, smaller firms have less bureaucracy and in theory can adapt their technology quicker to the needs of the marketplace. But a comprehensive examination of the empirical data[19]by Professors Anne Marie Knott and Carl Vieregger at the University of Illinois leads to the following conclusion:Not only do large firms (using the US Small Business Association definition of greater than 500 employees) conduct 5.75 more R...n aggregate than small firms, they have 13% higher productivity with that R...However this merely captures the private returns to their R...A further benefit of large firm R...s that it generates the spillovers upon which small firm innovation free-rides.(Emphasis added.)The point of 'small firm innovation free-rides' seems particularly salient, since smaller businesses are generally perceived in more benign terms politically than big multinational corporations. True, they do not suffer from 'the curse of bigness[20],' but the myth of the plucky entrepreneur obscures the fact that in many instances smaller businesses are in reality the bad guys when it comes offering decent wages and a generous array of social benefits, such as health care provision or tolerance of unionization (the decimation of which has played a huge role behind the increase of wage inequality in our society). Many businesses that are relatively small, and have minimal levels of concentration, are also marked by 'low productivity levels, productivity growth rates hovering around zero, and low real wages,' according to an INET-supported study[21]by Professors Lance Taylor and zlem mer. As a result, small businesses are often the first to protest increased regulation or 'burdensome' mandates, such as those for additional health care provision or increased unionization. And that hardly makes them ideal candidates for the kinds of things Warren is aiming to achieve with her proposals[22]. By contrast, one of Warren's chief targets, Google, has just mandated 'that all its temporary and contractor workers based in the United States receive a $15 minimum wage by 2020 and comprehensive healthcare, including eight sick days and 12 weeks of paid parental leave, by 2022,' according to a recent piece by Jillian D'Onfro for Forbes.com[23]. This echoes a recent move by Amazon[24]to raise minimum wages to $15 per hour. To be clear, there are many disturbing practices worthy of elimination in both Google and Amazon (here[25]and here[26]). But it is also salient that both companies introduced the increased wages largely in response to mounting political pressure (Amazon explicitly acknowledged this[27]), as opposed to waiting on legislation that would force the change. That provides some implicit support for the view that larger corporations generally have a greater economic capacity to enhance working conditions for their employees than smaller businesses (even if their motivations are to pre-empt even greater change that they strongly oppose). The point is that greed, as opposed to affordability, has driven the big tech companies' business decisions. But what is the right legislative response? Is it to tackle the greed via vigorous antitrust enforcement or to introduce labor legislation that facilitates unionization and shifts the power balance back somewhat toward labor? Historically, unionization has proven to be a much more effective route toward greater income equality, as unions proved more successful in mitigating the gap between labor productivity and wages.[28] Frustratingly, Warren and her fellow Democrats in general evince little interest in tripartite labor-business-government models of the kind that worked so well during much of the post-World War II period (before market fundamentalism assumed intellectual primacy), or structural interventions in the labor market\u2014via unionization or immigration policies, such as those embodied in Barbara Jordan's Commission[29]. In contrast to Trump's unthinking (and often racist) restrictionism, Jordan's immigration proposals sought to balance the 21st-century employment requirements of U.S. businesses with protections for 'U.S. workers against unfair competition from foreign workers, with an appropriately higher level of protection for the most vulnerable in our society.' Warren and her fellow Democratic presidential candidates admirably pay heed to the less fortunate via cash transfers from winners to losers with increased public provision. But they fail to consider whether the deregulated labor and goods markets that are hallmarks of today's antitrust propositions actually exacerbate the problems that create those vulnerabilities in the first place. Likewise, in regard to the issue of data security, and data privacy, antitrust might not offer the best solution. The EU framework for data protection[30], or the California Consumer Privacy Act[31], have the makings of early-stage templates for consumer protections on these issues (although in the case of Facebook, this may be a case of closing the barn door after the horse has bolted, given that American Facebook users are abandoning it by the millions[32], the company's 'original sharing' is rapidly declining[33], and its WhatsApp subsidiary, the takeover of which Warren seeks to unwind, is rapidly being superseded in quality by China's WeChat[34]). But what about the idea that we should all be thankful 'now [that] we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing,' as Warren herself queries[35]in support of increasing competition among search engines? Network theory, as I've written before[36], leads to a different kind of assessment, because the value of a search engine expands as an increasing number of other users use it, thereby enhancing its value to the user. The corollary also applies insofar as the benefits of a search engine diminish as the number of users decreases, as more search engines are created (and recall the earlier point about innovation and size, which suggests that more competitive choice does not necessarily mean that a better mousetrap is created). Given that these businesses have reached levels of sophistication and capacity, as well as unique periods of benign growth and talent agglomeration, they can't be easily replicated, so breaking them up via early 20th-century instruments, such as the Sherman Act, might not solve the problem. If there is something inherent about network effects whereby online social networks like Facebook or search engines such as Google lend themselves to becoming natural monopolies, then the answer might be to regulate them as utilities, rather than breaking them up, as no less a figure than right-wing populist Steve Bannon has suggested.[37]The advantage of the utility model of regulation is that it removes the determination of wages and prices of necessities from either markets or direct state control and put them in the more neutral realm of state-brokered bargaining (an approach earlier championed by both trust-buster Theodore Roosevelt and New Dealer Franklin D. Roosevelt). Finally, it has to be asked whether it is wise to formulate antitrust policy on the basis of specific domestic requirements, while ignoring the challenges posed by global state-subsidized Chinese national champions: companies such as WeChat, Huawei, Alibaba or Baidu[38]. Well-crafted industrial policy is the kind of thing the American economy used to do rather well in fact before the deregulatory zeal of the Chicago School maligned any kind of national development strategies as something akin to rent-seeking crony capitalism. As a general rule, the more one uses antitrust to produce increasing domestic competition and less large companies, the more we may have to close the domestic market to international competition and provide export subsidies in order to compete globally. That won't fly under the World Trade Organization, but without national protectionism and an assertive geo-economic strategy, the more costly becomes the application of antitrust rules based on national considerations alone. It is true, as Lina Khan acknowledges[39], 'If markets are leading us in directions that we, as a democratic society, decide are not compatible with our vision of liberty or democracy, it is incumbent upon government to do something.' The question is what that 'something' should be. The broader philosophical issue is whether antitrust works as an explicitly democracy- and pluralism-reinforcing institution, or whether these objectives are better achieved via other legislative measures (increased unionization, more progressive forms of taxation, utility-style regulation, campaign finance reform, institutional political reforms that encourage greater participatory democracy and minimize barriers to voting, to list a few examples). Beyond that, it is worth pondering whether the Big Tech behemoths are a product or a cause of our current democratic dysfunction. The earlier existence of progressive tripartite-type deals amid an industrial backdrop of big companies, big unions and big government suggest that today's problems with Big Tech are symptomatic of the decay of some of the functioning stools on which America's liberal democracy rested (declining unionization, increased political corruption), rather than the cause itself. Unfortunately, in her efforts to act as a cheerleader for capitalism[40]and market competition via aggressive antitrust remedies, Warren ignores other remedies of the kind embodied in the Treaty of Detroit[41]. And her antitrust proposals acknowledge no role for possible utility-style regulation (ironically, that is coming from the populist right). The problems she defines are real, but Warren's call to break up Big Tech is by no means the best route to the solutions she seeks to find.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/04/warrens-antitrust-proposal-should-we-break-up-big-tech-or-just-regulate-it-better.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/04/warrens-antitrust-proposal-should-we-break-up-big-tech-or-just-regulate-it-better.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[42], Economic fundamentals[43], Free markets and their discontents[44], Guest Post[45], Income disparity[46], Market inefficiencies[47], Politics[48], Regulations and regulators[49], Technology and innovation[50] on April 12, 2019[51] by Yves Smith[52].

And in the process, that have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>She cited Microsoft (MSFT) as an example of a large tech company that had anti-monopoly suits brought against it in the 1990s. The company reached a settlement with the government, but its case against the company helped clear a path for companies such as Google and Facebook to emerge, Warren said. </p><p>Breaking up the companies would ensure they didn't have the political clout to shape rules in their favor and \"snuff out\" or buy potential competitors, she said. About half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon and more than 70% of all internet traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook, Warren said.</p><p>The multinationals have used their power to force smaller competitors to sell at a discount and Google has acquired mapping company Waze and ad firm DoubleClick, deals that were waved through by government regulators rather than scrutinized or blocked.</p><p>Large tech companies now own their own marketplaces while also participating in the transactions, potentially creating a conflict of interest that Warren said undermines competition. She alleges Amazon copies goods smaller companies sell on its marketplace and then sells a branded version. The senator also said Google allegedly \"snuffed out\" a smaller search engine by demoting its content on a search algorithm and has favored its own restaurant ratings over Yelp.</p><p>\"As these companies have grown larger and more powerful, they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation, and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people,\" she said. \"To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MIDPRO-A1862551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MIDPRO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-JKR1-DY03-M528-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410393</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><timeReceived>11:28 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MT Newswires Live Briefs PRO</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20459\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She took aim at Amazon's search for lavish economic incentives from cities competing for its headquarters, likening the company's efforts to pit areas against each other to the dystopian film \"The Hunger Games.\"</p><p>\"That's what's wrong with the system. It's not just that big tech companies like Amazon have enormous market power, which they do. They have enormous political power,\" Warren told the audience, describing the industry's lobbying expenditures as a \"good return on investment if they can keep Washington from enforcing the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Warren will introduce legislation in the current Congress aligning with the first element of her plan. A spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, said a bill introduction was not imminent.</p><p>Warren's latest policy proposal also promised to be a central element of her scheduled visit Saturday to the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas.</p><p>Sen. Kamala Harris of California represents the tech industry's home state, while Sen. Cory Booker has come under scrutiny for his past ties to tech companies - though he's stepped up his criticism of the industry in recent years.</p><p>Facebook spokeswoman Monique Hall said the company had no comment on Warren's proposal. Representatives for Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Tali Arbel and Nick Jesdanun in New York contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-4407af172d46407f9b05300b0eeaadd5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-JNJ1-JC65-52KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><timeReceived>2:32 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 9, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, said a bill introduction was not imminent.</p><p>Warren's latest policy proposal promised to be a central element of her New York appearance as well as her scheduled visit Saturday to the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas.</p><p>One of her 2020 rivals, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, has faced criticism for his past closeness to the tech industry. A Booker spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment on Booker's view of Warren's new proposal. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

The former vice president was the quietest person on stage on the question of how to handle Silicon Valley. His rivals, echoing Warren, expressed degrees of unease with companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Twitter and how they're reshaping everything from elections to news to jobs to privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The contrast has become increasingly apparent in recent months, and it reflects the larger dynamic between the two candidates: Warren's allies call Biden unduly meek in the face of major national challenges, including the growing dominance of the tech giants. Biden's partisans dismiss Warren's proposals as simplistic, including her plan to break up the companies. Warren was out front early with a strategy to dismantle the likes of Facebook and Google, expanding her progressive appeal and leaving Biden to explain how he would handle them.</p><p>Pressed for a statement on the issue, Biden's campaign told POLITICO that the former vice president is broadly concerned about economic concentration and would \"aggressively\" use antitrust law and other tools to ensure that \"all corporations\" do right by their workers and customers. But Biden views Warren's singling out of tech as misguided and doesn't think a president should tell antitrust enforcers which companies to go after, his campaign said.</p><p>A close adviser said Biden's camp is reluctant to become drawn into what it views as Warren's \"weird litmus test.\"</p><p>\"It's easy to say you want to go after 'Big Tech' and break them up,\" said one senior economic policy official from the Obama White House who remains sympathetic to Biden. (The person spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss tensions that go back to the days of a presidency that Warren also served in.) \"It's a heck of a lot harder to come up with a coherent theory of the case of why that's a better outcome for consumers, prices, and innovation.\"</p><p>The Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>But Warren's approach looks to be working for her. Even where it might be least expected: In the last quarter of fundraising, she raised nearly a quarter-million dollars from employees of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, some of the very companies she has pledged to break up.</p><p>Sally Hubbard, the director of enforcement at the Open Markets Institute, an advocacy group deeply involved in the push for antitrust enforcement on tech companies, argued that Biden is carrying on the Obama administration's light-touch approach to the industry. Meanwhile, Warren is tapping into Americans' emerging sense that something is not quite right with Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"People are understanding that it's not just some technocratic, boring area,\" Hubbard said of the antitrust debate Warren has helped ignite. \"It's fundamentally about equality and freedom, the American way, the American dream. It's at the heart of capitalism and what we think of core American values.\"</p><p>Hubbard said she sees the Silicon Valley workers who give to Warren as acting in their own interests: Corporate breakups mean more employers to compete for their labor. Another factor is tech employees' agreement with Warren's push to fundamentally restructure the U.S. economy, said Peter Leyden, who runs a public policy-focused Silicon Valley media startup called Reinvent.</p><p>\"It's not contradictory or weird,\" said Leyden, a former managing editor of Wired. \"In general, tech workers in northern California, they're roughly down with it - that we have to rebalance the economy from a grossly unequal society.\"</p><p>The different tacks that Warren and Biden have taken on this massively powerful industry go back before the Obama era, to at least 2005, when the pair battled over bankruptcy reform.</p><p>That year, the Delaware senator and the Harvard law professor debated back and forth in a tense, substantive Senate hearing. At one point, Biden offered Warren the mixed compliment that she was making \"a very compelling and mildly demagogic argument.\"</p><p>The same phrase could capture the case Warren has made for breaking up tech, starting with a Medium post in March that said \"it's time\" to break up Google, Facebook, and Amazon - pledging that when she becomes president, her administration will do just that.</p><p>And Warren has hardly let up on the issue.</p><p>She posted a billboard in San Francisco, near a train station frequented by tech workers, blaring the message \"Break Up Big Tech.\" More recently, after leaked audio recorded Mark Zuckerberg saying his company would be forced to sue a Warren administration if it went ahead with a breakup, Warren has leaned into the fight - tweeting again and again her disdain for Facebook. She even ran a deliberately false ad designed to jab Facebook over a newly announced policy on misleading ads, which she and other critics say lets President Donald Trump get away with running lies on the platform.</p><p>Biden, meanwhile, has said little. But in response to repeated requests, his campaign sent along a quote from a campaign spokesperson outlining his thinking.</p><p>\"Vice President Biden is running for President to rebuild America's middle class and a critical element of getting that done is ensuring that all corporations - including tech giants - are treating their workers and customers fairly,\" read the statement from campaign spokesperson Mike Gwin. \"To accomplish this, a Biden administration will aggressively use all the tools available - including utilizing antitrust measures - to ensure that these corporations are behaving in a responsible manner and contributing to a greater prosperity for our economy and middle class.\"</p><p>People close to Biden say the former vice president is reined in by his reluctance to dictate targets and methods to regulators in a future Biden administration. By a combination of both tradition and statute, the country's chief antitrust enforcers - the Justice Department's antitrust division and the Federal Trade Commission - operate at a distance from the White House.</p><p>Recent history offers at least one example of a vice president-turned-presidential candidate paying a political cost for refusing to dictate to regulators.</p><p>In 2000, then-Democratic presidential hopeful Al Gore balked at speaking out against an airport planned for the edges of the FloridaEverglades, in part over worries about corrupting an ongoing Air Force analysis of the project. Gore instead called for a \"balanced solution\" - prompting some Florida environmental activists to endorse Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, who accused him of \"waffling as usual.\" Nader wound up getting 97,000 votes in Florida, far exceeding the 537-vote margin that delivered the state and the White House to George W. Bush.</p><p>That said, in the Trump era, political norms aren't once they were.</p><p>As a candidate in 2016, Trump declared that his administration would block AT&amp;T's attempt to buy Time Warner, saying the deal would put \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" After Trump won, his Justice Department indeed sued to stop the sale. And while a judge let it go through, AT&amp;T couldn't get traction with the argument that the president had inappropriately meddled in the DOJ's decision making.</p><p>Biden is arguably in the mainstream of the Democratic field: No candidate has come close to Warren's call for breaking up Google, Facebook and Amazon, even though the Democrats in Tuesday's debate took turns detailing a wide range of complaints about Silicon Valley's behavior and effect on society.</p><p>The candidates proposed various solutions, including more aggressive taxation of tech companies, requirements for transparency on social-media ads, and a redefinition of the major online platforms as publishers. But none agreed fully when asked point-blank whether Warren's breakup proposals were right.</p><p>Instead, several responded that as president, they would install strong antitrust enforcers to go after monopolies in multiple industries. \"We need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies,\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said. Former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro called for \"cracking down on monopolistic trade practices.\" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said, \"I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.\"</p><p>Only two candidates clearly objected, in whole or part, to Warren's proposal: Entrepreneur Andrew Yang argued that \"competition doesn't solve all the problems.\" And former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke lodged the strongest rejection of the Warren plan: \"I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That's something that Donald Trump has done.\"</p><p>Biden didn't get a chance to answer.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts unleashed the most aggressive attack to date on Amazon, Facebook and Google, pledging that if she becomes president in 2020 she will break each of those companies apart and rein in others that have \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\"</p><p>The senator's threat sent shock waves through Silicon Valley, where for years, tech companies enjoyed close ties to national Democrats who wanted to burnish their digital credentials and benefit from tech executives' deep pockets. The result long had been lax regulation of the industry - something Warren's proposal would end.</p><p>Tech experts said they fear other Democratic presidential hopefuls soon would follow her lead.</p><p>\"I don't believe this will be an out-of-the-mainstream proposal in 2020,\" said Rob Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank whose board of directors includes representatives from Apple, Microsoft, Google and other tech companies.</p><p>Calling Warren's plan \"appalling,\" Atkinson said of the tech industry's ties to Democrats: \"Not only is the honeymoon over, but they're in divorce court.\"</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Warren's proposal illustrates the tech industry's political fall from grace as policymakers grapple with the ills posed by Silicon Valley - from job losses threatened by the rise of automation to the spread of malicious falsehoods online. Facebook is facing the prospect of a multibillion-dollar fine for mishandling users' data, and the Trump administration just this month commissioned a task force to study whether Big Tech has become too big.</p><p>Nearly a decade ago, then-candidate Barack Obama famously appeared at Google headquarters during the early days of his 2008 campaign, hoping to tout his tech savviness particularly with younger voters. Now, though, the party's White House aspirants in 2020 have become some of the Valley's fiercest critics in pursuit of a different political edge. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), for example, broadly has decried the \"major monopoly problem\" in the United States - particularly with Big Tech. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, has tangled specifically with Amazon over its treatment of workers. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Spokesmen for Klobuchar and Sanders did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Another candidate, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who has bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford University, last year raised concerns about corporate consolidation across industries, including tech. But Booker, a regular visitor to the Bay Area, has long raised considerable money from the tech industry. His office declined to comment.</p><p>Warren's proposal, which was published on the Medium website, has two key elements. First, the Democratic lawmaker said her administration would appoint \"regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,\" including Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Facebook's tie-up with WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>Second, Warren said she would push legislation that would label key services - such as Amazon's marketplace for goods - as \"platform utilities,\" which would have to be spun off from tech giants' other businesses. In theory, that would stop Amazon from making, selling and promoting clothes, toys or other goods that compete with offerings from competitors on its website.</p><p>\"We must ensure that today's tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy,\" she wrote.</p><p>Recognizing the stakes, tech industry advocates quickly blasted Warren's proposal. The Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, said it was an \"unwarranted and extreme proposal, which focuses on a highly admired and highly performing sector.\"</p><p>Supporters, meanwhile, said Warren's antitrust pledge drew inspiration from history. In 1933, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, a law that forced banks to separate commercial and investment activities. Even today, banks are not permitted to control shopping chains, said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor and a critic of large tech firms, though Glass-Steagall was essentially repealed during the Bill Clinton presidency.</p><p>Wu and others also cited the 1980s breakup of AT&amp;T, which before it was split apart into seven regional \"Baby Bells\" controlled virtually every aspect of a consumer's telephone experience, from owning the handset in Americans' homes to operating the switches that connected their calls.</p><p>Warren's proposal also draws inspiration more recently from a forthcoming law article written by Lina Khan, an advocate of more aggressive antitrust enforcement, according to several people familiar with Warren's plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak openly about her efforts.</p><p>To that end, the senator's proposal foretells a looming struggle among Democrats over how far to distance themselves from an industry they once considered an ally, according to Hal Singer, an economist at George Washington University's Institute of Public Policy.</p><p>\"This is going to be a fight for the soul of the Democratic Party,\" he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:brian.fung@washpost.com\">brian.fung@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-95854b2641e711e9a0d31210e58a94cf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-TGG1-DYX1-H3WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><timeReceived>12:58 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 9, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
