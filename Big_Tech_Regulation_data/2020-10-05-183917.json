Here are a few things to consider.</p><p>First, since the passage of Sec. 230 in 1996, the government has been well entangled with the tech industry. In fact, the provision of law is central to their business model. The Sec. 230 debate generates so much light and heat not only because it governs speech online; it is the billion-dollar provision of law that has grown these companies from basement start-ups to industry giants. As one pro-Sec. 230 law professor <url normalizedValue=\"https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/isp/documents/new_controversies_in_intermediary_liability_law.pdf\">put it</url>, it amounts to an \u201cimplicit financial subsidy\u201d to internet companies. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/29/donald-trump-twitter-minneapolis-censored/\">(RELATED: Twitter Censors White House Account For Quoting Trump's Flagged 'THUGS' Tweet)</url></emphasis></p><p>These are private companies, yes, but their success or failure is built on the back of specific treatment by the government.</p><p>Second, that treatment is in some ways necessary. The immunity provided by Sec. 230 prevents these companies from being sued into oblivion for taking down smutty content, child pornography or other content the law defines as \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious\u201d and so on. It applies broadly not just to tech companies (though those are its most famous beneficiaries), but to the comments sections of online newspapers and sites across the web.</p><p>As <url normalizedValue=\"https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/isp/documents/new_controversies_in_intermediary_liability_law.pdf\">described</url> by former Republican California Rep. Chris Cox, one of the provision's authors, the provision was intended to \u201chelp clean up the internet\u201d by protecting companies who wanted to engage in good-faith removal of the nastiness that can flourish online.</p><p>But the modern application of Sec. 230 today is not what it was in 1996. Over the past 24 years, aggressive litigation has contorted the statute, broadening the immunity well beyond efforts to \u201cclean up the internet.\u201d For example, thanks to Sec. 230, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals<url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2019/03/important-section-230-ruling-from-the-second-circuit-herrick-v-grindr.htm\">did not hold</url> the dating app Grindr liable for failing to respond to repeated requests to remove fake posts that resulted in the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/herrick-v-grindr-why-section-230-communications-decency-act-must-be-fixed\">harassment and harm</url> of a user.</p><p>Sec. 230 also gives social media companies tremendous power to remove, block and filter user content based on their own policies - including, as we recently saw, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-twitter-trump-minneapolis-tweet\">tweets</url> from both the White House and the president of the United States.</p><p>This gets to the crux of the issue: the power of private tech companies to control speech in the public square - not to mention their tremendous power over your data, privacy, behavior and elections.</p><p>The text, reach and application of Trump's executive order is less about the technical merits of Sec. 230 than it is a proxy for that question. The arrogance of tech companies in blatantly <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/02/pro-lifers-social-media-bans-are-too-numerous-to-not-be-censorship/\">imposing political viewpoints, crushing small business, serially violating user privacy</url>\u00a0and acknowledging their       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/facebook-andrew-bosworth-memo.html\">power over election outcomes</url> has come home to roost.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/06/28/public-attitudes-toward-technology-companies/\">Seventy-two percent of the public</url>\u00a0thinks it's likely that social media platforms actively censor political views that those companies find objectionable.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2020/03/11/the-technology-202-new-polling-shows-most-americans-are-concerned-about-big-tech-s-power/5e67c2a5602ff10d49ac7abe/\">Seventy-seven percent</url>\u00a0of Americans think big tech has too much power.</p><p>Sec. 230 expert Jeff Kossof <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fight-over-section-230-internet-as-we-know-it/\">recently remarked</url> that the tech companies have \u201cproceeded for years basically treating Section 230 like it's a right that's enshrined in the Constitution ... and now what you're seeing is a backlash to that arrogance.\u201d</p><p>The amount of Sec. 230 reform proposals <url normalizedValue=\"https://amgreatness.com/2020/05/28/americans-deserve-open-debate-about-big-tech-and-free-speech/\">proliferating</url> in Congress demonstrates that it's not just Trump who thinks the law might need some updates. As recently as 2018, Congress amended Sec. 230 to remove liability protections for sites that knowingly assisted in sex trafficking. (Some tech groups even       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/eff-sues-invalidate-fosta-unconstitutional-internet-censorship-law\">fought that law</url> on the basis of its potential harm to free speech.)</p><p>Ultimately, it is Congress that has the power to change the law, though it will be up to the courts to decide if Trump can interpret its application, as the executive order attempts to do. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/30/ortner-the-first-amendment-will-be-the-only-casualty-in-trumps-war-with-twitter/\">(RELATED: ORTNER: The First Amendment Will Be The Only Casualty In Trump's War With Twitter)</url></emphasis></p><p>Everyone wants to ensure free speech online - indeed, much of the frustration from the president and his allies comes from a belief that free speech is being curtailed. Sec. 230 presents both opportunities and hazards to that end, and is just one of a handful of policy options lawmakers are considering, in addition to robust <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/tech-summer-antitrust-24cffcc6-8afc-41f8-9b91-5be6d8269202.html\">antitrust enforcement</url> and privacy legislation.</p><p>As much as the tech industry and its advocates might not think this debate should happen, it's clear that both lawmakers and a plurality of Americans do. Trump's executive order is a clear sign that this debate is only just beginning.</p><p>Rachel Bovard is the senior director of policy for the Conservative Partnership Institute.\u00a0</p><p>The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Thanks.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>So we've got a market that is once again following the bouncing ball of China.</p><p>President Trump, of course, addressed the economic club yesterday, an event that I attended. Futures are down this morning, but the president was talking about the China trade negotiations. He was talking about the strong economy. Here's a bit of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Unemployment has recently achieved the lowest rate in 51 year. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American unemployment and Asian-American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates in history.</p><p>Nearly 7 million people have been lifted off very importantly food stamps. Seven million people off of food stamps.</p><p>Since my election, the S&amp;P 500 is up over 45 percent. The Dow Jones is up over 50 percent. And the Nasdaq is up 60 percent.</p><p>Their supply chains are cracking very badly. And they are dying to make a deal. We're the ones that are deciding whether or not we want to make a deal. We're close. A significant phase one trade deal with China could happen. Could happen soon.</p><p>If we don't make a deal, we're going to substantially raise those tariffs. They're going to be raised very substantially.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tariffs, obviously, the major sticking point. The Chinese want the tariffs off. This is going back and forth between Washington and Beijing.</p><p>\"The Journal\" this morning is reporting that the disagreement center around whether the United States will remove existing tariffs or simply cancel the ones set to take effect December 15th.</p><p>And, you know, the December 15th tariffs I think is what keeps going back and forth between China and the U.S. How important is that for markets?</p><p>PAYNE: I think it's pretty important that we see something happen, right, because at this point we're hearing we have a deal and then, guess what, the rug -- you know, the rug gets pulled beneath us saying we don't have a deal now. So I think some sort of clarity around tariffs is pretty important. I think that's what's going to drive the market here for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I markets follow anything -- any develop on this.</p><p>I can't imagine how a deal gets done, James, without the big ticket items, like intellectual property theft.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think the Chinese are willing to at least make a commitment to that, whether they follow through in future years remain to be seen. But the president can always punish behavior that crops up in the future, right, if he gets that -- that change he wants in terms of stop stealing American intervention, don't force U.S. companies to have a local partner, I don't see why the tariffs shouldn't come down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I can't see this president taking off all the tariffs because that's what China wants and it just feels like then China wins.</p><p>FREEMAN: But we all win if we get --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, I know and --</p><p>FREEMAN: If we get zero tariffs and we get rule of law and fair play in China, then it -- then it's good for everybody.</p><p>I -- I hope he doesn't look at that as -- as losing if he makes it cheaper for us to buy goods.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: We want to buy their goods if they're not stealing ours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: If they're not steal ours.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But so far they've been unwilling, Mitch, to actually agree to an enforcement action within this deal.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Yes, and there are rumors that they're talking about it, so it may or may not be in phase one. It's allegedly in one of those chapters. But what we absolutely don't know is what the enforcement mechanism is, to James' point. So you could have all the words you want in the agreement about what you're supposed to do and what you're not supposed to do, but if there's no mechanism for enforcement, then forget about it.</p><p>And the only thing we have for leverage is tariffs themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So I'm assuming that one of the enforcement mechanisms will just be the reintroduction of tariff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the -- what's priced into the market already, Ryan? I mean do you think that the markets are expecting tariffs to stay in place or are they expecting that they won't go in place in December?</p><p>PAYNE: I think we're learning towards tariff won't be there in December because I think at this point --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Dow increase.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, I think the market's going up -- yes, the market's gone up a lot because we think we have some clarity around tariffs. And that's what we really need. I think the tariffs themselves aren't terrible. It's the fact we have no clarity and that's where capital expenditure, you know, really has been halted right now for companies. They need to have clarity around that. If they do, that's just huge for the markets and the economy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But, remember, the last 100 billion or so of goods that hasn't been subject to tariffs that got kicked to December 15th is this stuff, right?</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So it's all of the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, it's all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying, what's priced in --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because there you have ten days before the Christmas holiday. You know, you've got shopping going on in December. That's going to mean higher prices for like --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right, and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is bothering you as well.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And maybe not for the holiday season, but certainly we buy this stuff all year round.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So I think it's going to be a big issue.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think no more tariffs is the market expectation generally. But if you could get rids of what's been imposed, this is -- this is rocket fuel, even more than for the stock market, for the economy. The president reasonably noting all of the achievement so far, but this quarter is looking pretty soft. Yes, we got a very good October jobs report, but the estimates for growth this quarter are not great.</p><p>So -- so if he wants that -- that boom heading into his re-election, it would be great to get a deal now that gets rid of all the tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, no, that's -- that's a great point.</p><p>The president was very confident yesterday. You know, he went on about the accomplishments that this administration has had, but he's also -- he also basically said this impeachment is a scam and he feels going into this public hearings, today, and the rest of the week and next week, he feels that they're not going to do anything in term of changing people minds. We'll see about that.</p><p>Then there's the Federal Reserve. Jay Powell is testifying before the Congress' Joint Economic Committee later today. This is his first speech since signaling a pause in cutting interest rates about two weeks ago. The president weighed in on the Fed yesterday as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are actively competing with nations who openly cut interest rates, so that now many are actually getting paid when they pay off their loan, known as negative interest. Who ever heard of such a thing? Give me some of that. Give me some of that money. I want some of that money. Our Federal Reserve doesn't let us do to.</p><p>We are competing against these other countries, nonetheless, and the Federal Reserve doesn't let us play at that game. It puts us at a competitive disadvantage to other countries.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what do you think, Mitch? Any reaction (ph)?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I've said -- I've said before, a real estate person wants to lowest interest rates possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So I'm not surprised by that.</p><p>But just think about our economy. And so -- so Germany is in recession. It's had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. So it's not a surprise that the central bank in the European Union is trying to stimulate that economy as much as they possibly can.</p><p>We had, to James' point, 1.9 percent growth. Maybe not the greatest number, but that's still a good sign.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So I don't think our economy can be compared to economies around the world. But what the president's trying to say is, if their interest rates are low and we're trying to be competitive, then maybe our interest rates should be low too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But isn't there an expectation, though, that Europe can't generate any growth and yet the U.S., we're bottoming out here in terms of growth? I mean earnings were supposed to have the worst quarter this quarter, but get better in fourth quarter, get better in 2020.</p><p>Is that what the markets expected?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, and I'm -- I'm not sure what the president was really saying there because he seem to understand negative interest rates are insanity --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: And it hasn't worked in Europe and it hasn't given them the growth and the job creation that they were hoping for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet --</p><p>FREEMAN: And yet he's calling it a competitive advantage. Oh, why don't we punish savers and distorts our investment decisions just like they do?</p><p>Fortunately, there is less negative yielding debt around the world now than there was maybe six months ago. I hope we're on this path. I think people are starting to rule out in term of investor expectations that we will end up with negative rates in the United States. I hope not. That's a fundamental sign of weakness. I think people are getting more confident we're not going there. The economy's still in pretty good shape. But this is no competitive advantage for Europe over us.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And our capital markets depend upon capital coming here in search of yield.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So --</p><p>FREEMAN: This is the magnet.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Investment wreaking havoc on the dollar too, and I think that's what he's focused on --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Goo point, yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Is that -- that -- you know, the dollar's been really, really strong here, which it's actually starting to come down, and I think that's because, to your point, Maria, I think that we're starting to see a trough in economies, not just the U.S. but around the world also. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then there's the impeachment battle heating up this morning. The House will hold its first public hearings today. Acting ambassador to the Ukraine, Bill Taylor, and senior State Department official, George Kent, testifying together before the House Intel Committee.</p><p>James, your piece today in \"The Journal,\" best of the web anonymity gains are those great really has so much been demanded of so many by so few unidentified sources.</p><p>FREEMAN: It's kind of amazing here where we have a -- an anonymous federal employee trying to overturn the results of an election where 120 million Americans who identify themselves voted to elect this president. So I'm hoping we get some transparency.</p><p>But specifically on George Kent interview today, he said internally at the State Department in 2015 or 2016 that he saw a problem with Hunter Biden's deal with Burisma, the Ukrainian national gas company. I'm hoping we get some questioning and Adam Schiff allows some questioning to dig into that, who else was concerned in the government, what else did they know about Hunter Biden's activities in that country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I also thought it was interesting that you brought up this complaint filed last week that they're doing this GoFundMe page as well.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, this is the -- this is a Fox News scoop about a -- we now have a whistleblower on the whistleblower. So the second whistleblower is blowing the whistleblower and they're both anonymous, saying that his GoFundMe page for his legal expenses may have a problem because some donors may be anonymous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Speaking of anonymous, there are also anonymous people telling Hillary Clinton, putting enormous pressure on her apparently to run. So we've got to get into that today. She said many, many, many, many people are telling her she should run in 2020.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we're going get to that.</p><p>We're going to talk a short break.</p><p>When we come back, we're just getting started this morning. On deck this morning, former CIA station chief and Fox News contributor Daniel Hoffman is here on the Hong Kong violence. Arizona Congressman, House Judiciary Committee member Andy Biggs is joining us on the impeachment inquiry, and former White House press secretary, Fox News contributor, Sarah Sanders here talking about impeachment, plus the founder of CEO of Activate Michael Wolf is here giving us his update on the Disney Plus streaming rollout. We want to see what his take is. Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, let's slip in a short break. Then Google is under pressure once again. The federal government now looking into the technology giant after \"The Wall Street Journal\" broke the story that it secretly gained access to private health records across the country. We're going to tell you about that one.</p><p>Then Disney Plus downer. The new streaming service plagued with error message and long waits, apparently. We're going to take a look at that rollout which happened yesterday.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We talked to you about this story yesterday. Google's gathering of health record data. That is catching the eye of lawmakers now.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details here.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, here you go, Maria, concerns over Google gathering detailed health information on Americans has led to a federal inquiry. This according to a report in \"The Journal.\" Google's Project Nightingale is a deal with Ascension Health, which is meant to improve patient care, but the data gathering and the cloud storage is raising privacy and safety concern.</p><p>Well, the world's largest contract electronics maker posted about $1 billion in revenue for the third quarter. Foxconn saw profit rise 23.3 percent despite its biggest customer Apple seeing declining iPhone sales. The Taiwan-based company relies on Apple for about half of its revenue.</p><p>Then there is this, President Trump and Apple's CEO Tim Cook are expected to tour facilities in Texas where Apple products are made. This visit could happen as soon as next week and reportedly showcase companies that, well, keep jobs in America. The trip coming as Cook seek further relief from U.S. tariffs on imports from China. Back to that iPhone story. Apple stock in the pre-market down about half a percent.</p><p>And then there was this, a rocky technical start anyway for Disney's streaming service debut. So many folks were looking for a whole new role to content, at little joke, on Disney Plus, but they were hit with long waits and error messages. That was high demand, though. In fact, demand was so high, servers couldn't even keep up. So some would-be customers were prevented from signing up for the service yesterday. People, of course, went on social media, Maria, and they complain about it. But the criticism died down as Disney addressed all of the issues. Disney, of course, is down almost half a percent in the pre-market, Maria. Let's hope, you know, not really bad news, kind of good news, people were all over this thing yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And not unexpected.</p><p>CASONE: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a new service. You're always going to see, well, I don't know.</p><p>CASONE: Some new \"Star Wars\" shows apparently, which I'm getting ready to tune into, but I haven't been able to sign up yet (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: The content is incredible for Disney. I mean Netflix is going to have to pay, what, did it say $15 billion every year or certainly $15 billion next year after $13 billion this year to keep up with all the content.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I would think execution issues are about only thing that can stop Disney --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Because you look at the library, it's phenomenal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it really is.</p><p>Al right, we'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, wicked weather. It is freezing out. Icy conditions causing a 50 car pile-up in Ohio. The deep freeze is just beginning. We've got your full forecast when we come right back.</p><p>And then focus on the Federal Reserve. Jay Powell will testify today in Washington for the first time since putting his paws on interest rate cuts. We're taking a look at what to expect.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are looking at the U.S. economy this morning. President Trump speaking at the Economic Club of New York yesterday criticizing the policies of Democratic lawmakers.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Washington's Democrats and their radical agenda of socialism would demolish our economy reinstate the avalanche of regulations that have already ended, decimate the middle class and totally bankrupt our nation. As long as I'm president, America will never be a socialist country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is slamming 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren's plan to dramatically change rules for private equity firms, calling it a catalyst for grave economic consequences.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk about all of that is Cardone Capital fund manager, 10X movement founder, and \"The 10X Rule\" author Grant Cardone.</p><p>Grant, great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GRANT CARDONE, FUND MANAGER, CARDONE CAPITAL: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In a second I want you to explain the 10X rule. But let's talk capitalism versus socialism for a second because it look like this is what's sort of gearing up for the 2020 election.</p><p>CARDONE: You know, I moved out of California because they -- the socialist influence there, and taking my taxes from 10 percent to 13. Everybody's like, oh, it's only 3 point. It was a 30 percent increase. Moved all of our companies to Miami, where I knew no one, and we grew the company 50 time because we saved 13 percent.</p><p>So I think the people missed the idea or the concept that when I get a savings, I actually, as a business person, want to reinvest. I don't to just keep the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that enables you to create job.</p><p>CARDONE: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Increase wages.</p><p>CARDONE: And this is what the entrepreneur does, they take money and time and they risk it in order to get more time and money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>So there's an editorial in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning that we wanted to highlight, and it is critical of this new tax proposals by Democratic politicians. As the president suggested yesterday, like the recently unveiled millionaire sir tax, that would put an extra 10 percent tax on any individual income above $1 million, $2 million for married couple.</p><p>But it's not just ordinary income. It will also tax capital gains, for example. And the article goes on to say all the other things that the Democrats are proposing. Listen to this. Democrats are also proposing raising the regular income tax rate, the corporate tax rate, the capital gains tax rate, the dividend tax rates, the death tax, the payroll tax rates, creating a new wealth tax and a new financial transactions tax, a new carbon tax, a new pharmaceutical tax, even as they would repeal 100 percent business expensing and 20 percent income exclusion for so-called pass through firms.</p><p>You couldn't do anything that you were doing in terms of creating jobs (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>CARDONE: I would move out of the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What, you would move out of the country?</p><p>CARDONE: I've already moved once, I'll move again. I told my wife when we moved to Miami, I said, this might not be our last move. So that is the freedom of living in this country, is that I'm free to move wherever I want.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And money is mobile, James.</p><p>FREEMAN: It is.</p><p>You know, I'm glad you brought up that point about what happens when there's more money into business.</p><p>CARDONE: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: And I think it's important because so often this is presented as, billionaires, they have so much. We need to take some of it. And whatever you think of sort of philosophically how much someone ought to pay, the question is, do you want that next dollar spent by the Washington bureaucracy or by this investor and vender, entrepreneur? And where -- where is America going to get the best return? You look at the job creation, the invention that happens in the private economy versus government, it's really no contest.</p><p>CARDONE: Absolutely. Like, what we pay in property taxes in Florida, Texas, these are both zero state tax -- income tax. But property taxes on $1.5 billion is about $30 million a year in property taxes. So while I might not be paying income taxes in those states, I am still contributing, I'm adding jobs, I'm adding to payroll.</p><p>If these -- some of these things that Maria just went over happened, I would not be hiring. I wouldn't go from 50 employees to 185 employee.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You couldn't.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>And when you weaponnize profits in the rhetoric, you don't realize that company like Amazon create -- have 750,000 employee, right?</p><p>CARDONE: Yes. Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So what do you think's happening? You know, they're creating something and they're creating livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>CARDONE: I think that list could go on and on, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, right.</p><p>Real quick before you go, Grant, the ten times rule, what does it mean?</p><p>CARDONE: The 10X rule is a multiplier. It's about the -- it's a conversation to the middle class that they have to learn how to scale. They learn how to save money. They learn how to make money. They know how to work hard, but they haven't learned how to scale their money and multiply money so that they can actually have freedom.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you do it?</p><p>CARDONE: And this is what Jamie Dimon was saying a couple of days ago about this is the best economy and forever, but the middle class is not feeling that because they're -- the middle class is still buying homes, trying to save money. Saving money today is not what it was 20 years ago. People should not be saving money, they should be burning cash, investing in their business, investing in their brands, advertising, rather than leaving it at the bank. They have to learn how to scale money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's a rock bottom interest rates, so you're not really making anything on your money.</p><p>CARDONE: You're losing money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're losing money in some corner certainly.</p><p>Grant, congrats. Thanks so much.</p><p>CARDONE: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to have you this morning. Grant Cardone joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the chaos in Hong Kong continued overnight. Schools are now closing for the first time since the protests begun. More violent demonstrations breaking out in the city. We are going to take you there when we come back.</p><p>And then the deep freeze back in the U.S. A 50 cars pileup in Ohio causing an icy traffic nightmare as the majority of the country is seeing the mercury take a nose dive this week. We will have the full forecast when we come right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back.</p><p>Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Good morning to you, I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, November 13th.</p><p>Your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>There is some new China trade uncertainty this morning. President Trump says phase one of a deal could happen soon, but also threatens tariff hikes if no deal is actually reached.</p><p>The push for impeachment goes on. The public hearings will kick off today. It's a big week in Washington. We are taking a look at what to expect from these hearings this morning and what it could mean for trade deals that are still waiting on approval.</p><p>The future of the U.S. economy. Investors are waiting on Fed Chair Jay Powell today. His testimony happen on Capitol Hill this morning. We are looking for any hints at where rates could be headed next.</p><p>Markets this morning are under pressure going into all of that. Take a look. Futures down 111 point right now on the Dow. S&amp;P futures down 12 and the Nasdaq futures lower by 41. The Nasdaq closed at a record high yesterday. Meanwhile, we are still in historic, uncharted territory. The S&amp;P 500 hit an historic intra-day high yesterday. It closed 1.25 points shy of a new all-time high. The Dow unchanged, first time that's happened since April of 2014.</p><p>Global market this morning look like this. Take a look at European indices. And we are seeing selling there as well. The FT 100 down 35, CAC quarante in Paris down 27. DAX index in Germany town 99.</p><p>In Hong Kong, continued protesting overnight. Concerns that the U.S. could be imposing more tariffs on Chinese goods, pushing markets lower in Asia across the board. Worst performer, Hong Kong, down almost 2 percent.</p><p>And then there's this. The big chill. Most of America waking up to a very cold day today. The forecast coming your way, coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, the chaos in Hong Kong. Anti- government protests ranging in the city center for the third straight day, prompting the government to close down public schools tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News contributor, former CIA station chief, who served in Moscow, Iraq and Pakistan, Daniel Hoffman.</p><p>Daniel, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DANIEL HOFFMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You too. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the Hong Kong protests. What strikes you most here? Is it what it's done to Hong Kong, how the world perceives Hong Kong? China's authoritarian rule or something else? I mean what do you take away from this?</p><p>HOFFMAN: What strikes me is their staying power. These protests have been ongoing since March. It's a clash of civilization between this brutally repressive communist Chinese dictatorship and brave Hong Kongers who were protesting to try to preserve some of their basic human rights.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know it's interesting that even though they put the extradition bill aside, that the Hong Kongers don't trust the Chinese are going to let up, even though Carrie Lam says that the extradition bill is not actually happening.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Right. And they -- obviously they want investigation on police brutality. They want the promises of 1997 to be fulfilled in terms of the traditional freedoms that the people of Hong Kong have long enjoyed.</p><p>And, Daniel, I'm wondering, related to that, how you think this ends? It -- I see Carrie Lam has lost confidence on basically all sides, the chief executive of Hong Kong, but how does this get resolved if it can be resolved?</p><p>HOFFMAN: I'm not sure that it can. I think Hong Kong is a real existential threat to China because of their focus on preserving what little democracy they still retain. Remember, Carrie Lam was China's hand-picked leader of Hong Kong back in 2017 and one of the demands from the protesters is that she resign, as well as a number of other demands, including permanently withdrawing that extradition bill which cause so much concern.</p><p>There's a lot of financial pain that Hong Kong is facing in the financial market. And that, I don't think, is going to be enough to induce China to back down. They're concerned about the impact on mainland Chinese who see democracy uprising in Hong Kong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>You know -- you know, Mitch, how much pain will China take? I mean what -- Daniel makes a good point in terms of the stock market in Hong Kong, but it's also the perception of Hong Kong. I've said this many times, I always thought of Hong Kong as an international hub that could go right head-to- head compete with London, compete with New York. I don't see it that way anymore.</p><p>As a business guy, the both of you, I mean do you see it that way?</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: It used to be, if you want to take a company public and you didn't want to do it in the United States, you would do it in Hong Kong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. That's right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: If you want to declare transaction, you do it through a bank in Hong Kong.</p><p>Right now businesspeople are not going there. And the thing that strike me, and I'm curious about this, Daniel, is the protesters are the young. So they're looking at their future and saying, we don't want the future the way we project that it may happen. And it's hard to change their views. So this may be -- it's a permanent thing there that they just don't believe in the -- the prospects of ever being really independent.</p><p>HOFFMAN: They also have a keen sense of history. This year, August 23rd, they held a human chain, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers holding hands to protest and to try to preserve their democracy. They chose that date because it was the date of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939. There was the famous Baltic human chain in 1989 commemorating the 60 years of that secret pact which divided eastern Europe between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.</p><p>I do believe they've got great staying power and they're looking to the United States for support, frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOFFMAN: And I think that's a key element for them.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Daniel do you see Beijing placating them here, actually making some compromises, real compromises? Is that realistic at this point?</p><p>HOFFMAN: I think one of the challenges -- listen, Hong Kong has a long history of protest going back in 2003, the most famous of which arguably the umbrella movement in 2014. This one is spiraling, increasing violence, increasing concern that China will intervene militarily. They've got a lot of troops stationed in the mainland overlooking Hong Kong.</p><p>I just think that the longer this goes on, the higher the risk is that this could get even bloodier. And, again, I think it's an existential threat for China.</p><p>And, you know, China doesn't -- knows there would be great risk in bringing violence to Hong Kong, greater than we've seen so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOFFMAN: But, at the same time, the concern is they may be forced to do so, and that would be obviously just extraordinarily tragic for the people there and have its impact on financial market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Daniel, I want to move on to Turkey in a second, but let me just tell you what a friend of mine who's in Hong Kong right now -- actually he's in China -- and he said, in terms of the Hong Kong story, there's a common belief amongst the Chinese that it's the U.S. intel agency behind and supporting this unrest. This -- what do they call it, the quiet hand of the United States.</p><p>Do you think that that's what the Chinese leadership thinks, that the U.S. is somehow behind this?</p><p>HOFFMAN: No, I don't -- I don't think they believe that, but I think what they're trying to do is taint the protest movement by associating it with the United States intelligence wars (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>HOFFMAN: In fact, an indigenous movement striving for democracy. And then that's what scares China the most, democracy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick on Turkey. The president of Turkey, Erdogan, visiting the White House today amid a lot of controversy there. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that U.S. drones appear to show Turkish back forces in Syria targeting civilians after the U.S. forces took a step back from fighting in region.</p><p>Your reaction to what take place at the White House today when Erdogan visits the president?</p><p>HOFFMAN: That's certainly a key area of concern that Turks are using their proxy forces. The Syrian National Army, made up of Sunni Arab fighters to ethnically displace the Kurds and carry on the fight against Assad.</p><p>The concern for the United States is that lost in that is the need to fight ISIS. And I think the Turks are more focused on is ethnic displacement of the Kurds and that safe zone and less focused on -- on the -- on the ongoing threat from those ISIS terrorists.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Daniel, we'll leave it there. Great to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>HOFFMAN: You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Daniel Hoffman.</p><p>Be sure to tune into Fox Business, 3:00 p.m. this afternoon for President Trump's live news conference with Erdogan. We will take that live, so do join us later on today at 3.</p><p>Meanwhile, we go to the extreme weather now. White-out conditions causing an unimaginative 50 car pileup on an Ohio highway yesterday. Take a look at this. Freezing temperatures stretching across the United States this morning. It is just getting started, apparently.</p><p>Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean with a full forecast right now.</p><p>Janice.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Maria, the big story across the country is the cold air, record setting cold, 70 percent of the country right now below freezing. There are your current temperatures right now, 12 in Chicago, 25 in Dallas, 31 in Houston, Texas. We actually saw snow as far south as Texas yesterday. That's the wind chill. That's what it feels like out there. Single digit, teens here in New York City, it feels like 11 degrees. Temperatures reminiscent of January.</p><p>We have freeze advisories stretching across the Gulf Coast in towards the southeast, that's how cold it is. Twenty-four-hour temperature change. Look at what it was this time yesterday. Over 30 degrees warmer here in New York City.</p><p>The good news is, it's short-lived. The bad news is, we're still steeling (ph) the potential for snow across the Great Lakes and the upper Midwest, places that saw over two feet of snow. So lake effect snow is going to be ongoing throughout the next couple of day, but we will see some relief in terms of temperatures. Starting this weekend into early next week, much of the country will be above average.</p><p>So there's your silver lining. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Janice, thank you. We like that silver lining. Janice Dean.</p><p>Coming up, back to the gridiron. Colin Kaepernick could get a shot at an NFL job. We will explain when we come back.</p><p>And then the state of real estate. One sector experiencing a recent glut, giving investors some pause. We're going to get into it when we come right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Turning to 2020 now. Someone new taking the Democratic lead in Iowa.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details there.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: This is something else, Maria. Mayor Pete Buttigieg taking a slight lead in Iowa according to a new poll. The Mammoth University survey shows that Buttigieg at 22 percent along likely Democratic caucus goers in Iowa. Former Vice President Joe Biden stands at 19 percent there. Senator Warren taking 18 percent. Senator Bernie Sanders at 13 percent. Buttigieg's 3 percentage point advantage over Biden is within the poll's margin of error, but represents a remarkable surge over the last few months for him, about (ph) 16 points since August actually.</p><p>Well, so much coffee. The world's largest Starbucks is opening in Chicago. The company making another big belt on the consumer with the four-story complex. Fox Business' Jeff Fox spoke exclusively with CEO Kevin Johnson about the economy and the American consumer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN JOHNSON, CEO, STARBUCKS: So thus far, in the U.S. anyway, I think we're seeing very healthy consumer sentiment.</p><p>JEFF FOX, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: You don't have worries about the future? I mean I'm sure you're always concerned, but --</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, look, we -- you know, we've been in business 49 years. We've had to navigate a wide range of macroeconomic and geopolitical situations. And we will in the future. But right now I think what we're seeing is a healthy consumer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Johnson also said he hasn't seen any backlash from the ongoing trade dispute with China at the 4,100 Starbucks stores that are located in China.</p><p>And there is there, Colin Kaepernick getting another shot at the NFL. According to a memo obtained by ESPN, he's holding a private workout to evaluate his readiness and interest in reviving his stalled career. Now, Kaepernick has been on the sidelines since 2016 after sparking lead wide national anthem protests.</p><p>I should point out, guys, when he was with the 49ers in 2016, he played in 12 games, he started 11 of those, and, guys, his team won one game. The workout scheduled for this Saturday, we'll see who shows up. I'm just pointing that out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>What do you guys think?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, he had some good years and then some not good year and so you wonder what's the upside here. Does he add that much to your team as probably a backup quarterback for the baggage that he bring. And you're thinking about, what is an NFL city where people don't like cops and don't like the flag and the anthem. That's hard to think of one.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>I think -- I mean you've got to give him credit. I think he's great at promotion. You know, at the end of the day, I think this seems a little bit like a promotional type of cause for himself. But, I mean, that's kind of what he's very good at.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For himself, not for the NFL. Remember what happened during that whole NFL controversy over kneeling. Ratings went down. People were done with it. They didn't want to have this controversy on the football field.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And there are a couple of upstart league that are trying to get off the ground and I don't know that they're going to want that kind of attention. But some say there's no such thing as bad publicity, so we never know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: I would agree with that, actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see.</p><p>All right, a quick break, and then the state of real estate. One sector experiencing a recent glut, giving some investors pause. That's next.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>We're looking at market and looking ahead to a lot happening in Washington today.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are zeroing in on real estate this morning. Senior housing developers added more than 21,000 new units in 2018. That doubled the number added in 2014 according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care. Now developers are facing a new challenge, baby boomers are ditching senior housing, preferring to stay in their homes.</p><p>Join us right now is Waypoint Real Estate Investments CEO Scott Lawlor.</p><p>And, Scott, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>SCOTT LAWLOR, CEO, WAYPOINT REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We want to zero in on seniors but also on your focus of rental housing.</p><p>But, first, tell us what's going on with seniors right now.</p><p>LAWLOR: So, you know, senior housing has attracted a lot of capital because everyone understands the long-term demographic story, which is very, very compelling. I fear that some of the capitalist showed up a little early. I think there's maybe a lack of understanding of the fact that the real demographic bulge, if you will, is about 10 years out. But the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's when the baby boomers will start retiring --</p><p>LAWLOR: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And wanting these senior housing facilities.</p><p>LAWLOR: Yes. Well, they might still start retiring sooner than that, but they're not going to seriously think about assisted living, independent living, this kind of thing. Typically into the early 80s, and the boomers are maybe mid-70s right now with the oldest.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I gotcha.</p><p>LAWLOR: So there's a ways to go before that demographic bulge really, really hits. And what's happened is a lot of capital showed up ahead of that.</p><p>That's OK, you know, so there will be some pockets of softness in the short run, but in the long run I think it's a very, very compelling story. So are seniors wanting to stay at home, like my parents do, or are they wanting these senior facilities?</p><p>LAWLOR: So there's a lot of discussion about whether there will be less demand for senior facilities for that reason. But the fact is, I think there will be different preference for different people. And, you know, sadly, it depends, to some degree, on your personal circumstance. Some seniors, as you get into your 80s, whether it's family, spouse, friends whathaver -- what have you, will be seeking more communal environment and some who have the ability financially, and from a personal perspective to stay in the home will choose to do that, but there will be plenty of demand for the product we're talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: One of the things that we've talked about on the show is how the baby boomers have this tremendous amount of wealth that they've accumulated and they're, at some point, going to transfer it to their children. But if they have all that wealth, is much of that tied up in their homes? Is that the reality of the wealth of the baby bomber generation?</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is such an important -- I love this story. \"Forbes\" first reported it, that there's going to be this massive transfer of wealth from baby boomers to their kids, millennials and a little older, of $68 trillion in the next ten years. That's the story you're talking about.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. And if it's tied up in their homes, are they going to monetize that or are they just going to sort of live off of it with reverse mortgages and all of that sort of stuff?</p><p>LAWLOR: I think a lot will monetize it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>LAWLOR: I mean as you get to a stage where you're make a living decision, I think the living -- you know, the living decision will prevail over whether or not to monetize the home. In other words, if what you're saying is, are they going to hang on just to hang on, I mean, you don't need to hang on to your home to transfer wealth, right?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right. Yes. Fair enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, just look on other side of that too, like millennials now are getting to a stage where they're looking to buy homes. Do you see that really driving the overall real estate market moving forward because now they have a -- you have a shortage there for starter homes and things like that on the other side.</p><p>LAWLOR: Yes, that's another place we're undersupplied is starter level home.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>LAWLOR: The millennial story is a big one and it's an interesting one because some millennials are getting to the, you know, the stage where you typically think about get married, have kids, move to the suburbs and so on. I don't know that there's as strong a view about owning though, OK, because the millennials are the first generation in several that witnessed, you know, the opposite direction in home values.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>LAWLOR: We have 70 years in a role where home value only went one way. So it's sort of a law of the universe of the United States, the best thing you can do with your dough is buy a home. The millennials, right, saw it, whether they were in high school or college during the crash, saw their parents suffer tremendous wealth destruction because of home value. Not to say a lot of them won't want to own a home --</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, I rent.</p><p>LAWLOR: But it's not -- it's not as prevalent as it used to be. So, for instance, one strategy we're looking at is ground up development of single family homes for rent, because we think that might be a solution. You might want the backyard and all, but not want to --</p><p>PAYNE: Rent to own or just to rent?</p><p>LAWLOR: Just to rent. Just to rent. You might want the living experience but not the financial drain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the college story. Some parents apparently putting money that they'd spend on a college room and board into local real estate. They're, instead, putting their kids in an apartment. Your firm has properties in college towns in America. What's the trend there?</p><p>LAWLOR: Yes, so we're -- have been very active in the student housing business the last few year and I've heard a bit about what you're describing where, you know, rather than rent an apartment for your son or daughter, you'll buy them a condo unit say. I don't know if it's as big a trend as some of the, you know, the headlines might suggest. It's not really driving the market per se.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>LAWLOR: The student housing business has experienced a little patchiness the last couple year as well. There's been a lot of new supply there too. Capital has just been looking for something to do in the rental housing space, frankly. But we're also long-term believers. There's a whole host of reasons we like this space. You know, most importantly, students taste preferences and, in fact, maybe demands have changed dramatically. And most existing stock does not comport with current preferences.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I'm looking at the map. I see you have a Michigan. If you have a place in Ann Arbor, we'll talk after the --</p><p>LAWLOR: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh, I was just going to ask if investing in home renovations in suburban New Jersey is a good idea. Because I'm sure a lot of viewers (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>PAYNE: Only appreciates.</p><p>LAWLOR: Absolutely. A new kitchen.</p><p>FREEMAN: All right, well, I lost that argument.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Scott, great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>LAWLOR: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great insight from you.

And on behalf of the vets, the press should be ashamed of  themselves. They are calling me and they are furious because I sent people  checks of a lot of money. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we're going to give you the names right now which is what you want, and  instead of being like thank you very much, Mr. Trump or Trump did a good  job, everyone said, who got it, who got it, who got it? And you make me  look very bad. I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a  good job.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST:  Donald Trump speaking from Trump  tower about his donations to veteran's charities. </p><p>This is Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Deirdre Bolton. </p><p>Donald Trump says he raised close to $6 million for veterans organizations  and named ones that received money. He says that if he is president he will  hit back at the press if they write false stories just as he will hit back  at party leaders that don't support him.</p><p>With me now, Katrina Pierson, Trump campaign spokesperson. Katrina, welcome  back. Glad to see you. </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, DONALD TRUMP NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON:  Great to be here.  Thank you. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Trump supporters admire his fighting spirit. Rush Limbaugh  started his radio show this morning with this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST:  People have been begging for all  republican to just once take on the media the way Trump did. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  So, Katrina, how much feedback on that 40-minute press conference  are you getting? </p><p>PIERSON:  Tons of feedback. You know, my inbox is so full right now from so  many people across the country saying finally, this is one of those  situations where, when Mr. Trump held this, when he held this fund-raiser,  this was a spontaneous fund-raiser put it together within 24 hours. </p><p>We had been saying it will take a little bit of time to vet some of these  organizations to bring in the money that was pledged by the way, not on  hand. And for weeks, and almost every day we heard about the veterans fund- raisers and where is the money. </p><p>Mr. Trump is not politician. Mr. Trump has been doing things for people his  whole life. So, this idea that somehow there was some animus reason that  Mr. Trump did this, I mean, it really showed today in the media is now  covering of the actual fund-raiser really goes to show, and people are so  fed up and frustrated with the hypocrisy on the way republicans are covered  versus the way democrats are covered or lack there off. </p><p>BOLTON:  So you feel like there is clearly a bias, but speaking of  democrats, Hillary Clinton's campaigns is planning series of events to take  on Trump's record on vet's issues. </p><p>So, her campaign apparently is going to have speakers who are all vets, I  should state in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire, Florida,  Colorado, so all battleground states. Are you planning to counter that  counter? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, I'm sure we will. I mean, this is one of those -- one of  those issues that Mr. Trump has been extremely strong on. And, you know,  there are two groups of people that I've seen personally Mr. Trump get a  little emotional about. </p><p>And that is veterans who have been treated completely unfairly. When you  have illegal aliens that are getting treatment faster than veterans that's  absurd. And this is a Hillary Clinton policy by the way, someone that's  been in office, someone that has been in public life, the first lady being  a senator and Secretary of State and has done what for veterans? </p><p>Absolutely nothing. This is something close to Mr. Trump's heart. And over  the campaign trail when he saw an opportunity to do something for veterans,  he did it. He took action. And that's the kind of leader that we need. </p><p>BOLTON:  Now speaking of fighting, so he's obviously fighting Hillary  Clinton and it looks like that is going to be the match up in November,  although TBD on the democratic side but he is still fighting within the  party.</p><p>I mean, he tweeted out his response to Bill Kristol calling for a strong  independent third party candidate. He says, \"The Republican Party has to be  smart and strong if it wants win in November. Can't allow lightweight,\" so  everyone assumes the reference to Kristol, \"to set up a spoiler in the  candidate.\"</p><p>And then he also tweeted, \"If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get as  spoiler to run as independent, say good-bye to the Supreme Court.\" But  aside from Bill Kristol, aside from Mitt Romney and we are pretty sure that  Bill Kristol has Mitt Romney in mind, how is the unification plan going  from your point of view? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, the way you pose the question is exactly what's happening.  The party is with Mr. Trump. He has broken a record in GOP primary turnout.  And there is just handful of republicans, establishment republicans who  want status quo. They want to keep things the same. And they know we'll  have that with Hillary Clinton. </p><p>But for the most part Mr. Trump is unifying the party. Reince Priebus,  chairman of the RNC said it's time to get behind the front-runner. We have  so many people with the RNC and in the states, we now have state chairman  coming on board. </p><p>So, this unification process is moving along, particularly now that we've  now several endorsements on the Hill, whether congressional chairman or  just other members in the party. Those who don't want to get on board are  those who want to keep the things the same way. </p><p>And those who have been rejected twice now by the people, Mr. Trump  transcends party even though he's unifying Republican Party, he is unifying  the American people with a pro-America message. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK. But one thing I wanted to ask when you talk about pro-America  and unification, there are some who say he unfairly went after New Mexico  Governor Susanna Martinez, and it relates to what I want to ask you about. </p><p>Because he is going after the judge who is ordering the release of the  Trump University documents, bringing up the judge's Mexican heritage. Here  is the comment. I just want to circle back with you after.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He is a  hater. </p><p>(CROWD BOOING)</p><p>His name is, Gonzalo Curiel, the judge who happened to be, we believe  Mexican which is great. I think that's fine. You know what he what? I think  the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald Trump when I give all these  jobs, OK? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  So, on one hand should the judge recuse himself and on the other  hand, how do you see Donald Trump's outreach to the Latino population? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, look, this judge is a problem. He does not like Mr. Trump.  This is activist judge appointed by Barack Obama because Barack Obama  wouldn't appoint anyone other than an activist judge. </p><p>And there was great article just released today in the American Spectator  that gives specific details about this judge. And the simple fact that he  is the friend of the lawyer on the opposite side. So, he should absolutely  recuse himself. </p><p>But it's important that Mr. Trump mention that for a reason because we do  see a lot of these anti-Trump protesters who are very much pushing the  anti-American message of the way they're behaving at some of the rallies on  the outside and waving the Mexican flag. They're holding up La Raza signs. </p><p>These are very much important details that the mainstream media is leaving  out. So it's going to be up to Mr. Trump to get that word out. </p><p>BOLTON:  And just to finish the point, what do you make of the relationship  with the governor of New Mexico, Martinez? </p><p>PIERSON:  Look, Governor Martinez was a never Trumper to begin with. I  mean, she has said things publicly against Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump is a  counterpuncher.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  So some people think she would be a great V.P. </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, not Mr. Trump, obviously. But look, Mr. Trump doesn't see  party. He doesn't see race, and he doesn't see gender. He just wants to do  what is right for the country. He wants to get back to common sense  government. And he is counterpuncher. </p><p>She criticized him, he criticized her. And just because she is a woman or  just because she is Latino means nothing. Mr. Trump is going to treat  everyone the same and it's been that way from the beginning. </p><p>BOLTON:  It certainly has been. Katrina, thank you. Glad to have you with  us.</p><p>PIERSON:  Great to be here.</p><p>BOLTON:  Katrina Pierson joining me there, she is a spokesperson for the  Donald Trump campaign.</p><p>Well, with more on the subject, how Donald Trump handled the media on his  donations to veterans, he did turn over the microphone to a vet from New  Hampshire. Here are that vet's comments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>AL BALDASARO, VETERAN:  Stop using veterans as political pawns. You got a  guy outside, McCoy, go do a Google search on his Facebook. He is out there,  his picture is with the Clintons. They are using veterans as political  pawns and it must stop. </p><p>Donald Trump is doing this from the heart. You're all focused on the way he  is raising money and you're not looking at 22 veterans that are killing  each other every day. You're not concerned about the thousands of veterans  that are on wait lists. </p><p>Look at his plan on his Trump web site. He talks about medical cards. He  talks about fixing the V.A. He talks about competition. I think the liberal  media and I've been dealing with you a long time and get your head out of  your butt and focus on the real issues. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  My political power panel is here. Jillian Melcher, Heat Street  political editor, republican strategist, Mercedes Schlapp; and democratic  strategist Holly Shulman. Welcome to you all. So, Gillian, in your view how  did Trump handle the press conference? </p><p>JILLIAN MELCHIOR, HEAT STREET POLITICAL EDITOR:  I don't think he handled  it wonderfully. I mean, it's great for the Washington Post to follow up on  this. He made a commitment to help veterans to support them that was widely  viewed...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  So, I just want to cut you off so everybody else follows. </p><p>MELCHIOR; Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, many people saw this 40-minute press conference as response to  a piece written in the Washington Post which was essentially, was not  titled, where is the money but that is essentially the point of the piece. </p><p>MELCHIOR:  Exactly, they could not find a single veteran's organizations  that had received one the $1 million that Trump said he'd given. So, there  is a lot of speculation, a lot of question. All of sudden Trump produces  the check. He says it's supposed to be about scrutiny about vetting the  charity...</p><p>BOLTON:  But he has given out more than three million. </p><p>MELCHIOR:  Well, he ended up doing it, but he's saying that vetting is the  reason for four-month delay. </p><p>BOLTON:  Right.</p><p>MELCHIOR:  But he ended up giving it to a guy who runs a charity, who's not  only running charity, he works for the SoHo Trump. So, this is somebody  within his own corporation. I think the vetting excuse doesn't hold water. </p><p>I think he needs to be held accountable for this and it's fair for The  Washington Post reporters to ask these questions. </p><p>BOLTON:  But in fairness, I take all your point, in fairness to Trump, he  got out there and pretty much delineated Excel's spreadsheet line, by  spreadsheet line, where the money came from, where it's going. Mercedes,  what is your take? </p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, I've got to tell you I'm  still waiting to see how much money Hillary Clinton has given to any of the  vets. Let's be realistic here. </p><p>This is a guy who made a promise that he was going to give millions of  dollars to veterans groups. I've never really seen a presidential candidate  take such interest in insuring that these veterans get the help that they  need. </p><p>With that being said, I do believe that he has a special connections with  the veterans groups. I think that he is true to his word. I think when you  look at Hillary Clinton and the fact that she's made millions of dollars  off of these Wall Street speeches, and yet, she is trying to hit Donald  Trump on the fact of whether he is giving the money or how much money he  has given? Fine. </p><p>I think that it's the media's responsibility to, yes, check and make sure  that he is delivering on his promise but at the same time, I mean, he is  taking an unconventional approach which Hillary Clinton doesn't even know  how to respond to. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Holly, since you're our democratic voice, what is your take on  that, especially in light of the Clinton campaign planning this whole  series of counterattacks if we're going to call them that for the next few  days to try to reach out to veterans? </p><p>HOLLY SHULMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  One thing has been clear through  this whole process and that's Donald Trump only cares about veterans when  it's politically expedient for him. And that's what we've seen today. </p><p>Hillary Clinton, despite the political benefits has reached across the  aisle, worked with Senator John McCain for $50 million for veterans rehab  center in Texas. She's worked with Lindsey Graham to expand health care for  reservists, for National Guard. </p><p>And she has a career of working on these issues and fighting for veterans.  And if he wants to make this an issue in the campaign I would say, bring it  on. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. We're going to have more to talk about. Jillian,  Mercedes, Holly all back with me. In the meantime, we want to let you know  Donald Trump dismissing libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson as  a fringe candidate earlier today. </p><p>Mr. Johnson will be Kennedy's guest tonight. Tune in. You do not want to  miss the conversation, 8 p.m. Eastern Time. </p><p>Looking at the markets averages on mix, the last straight day of the month.  The Dow, NASDAQ, and the S&amp;P, all up for May, making the Dow and the S&amp;P  500's longest monthly winning streak in two years. If you look at the  leading groups, tech, health care and finance. </p><p>Well, next Tuesday the all-important California primary on the democratic  side. It is getting too close for comfort. Hillary Clinton canceling a New  Jersey event to head out to the Golden State early. </p><p>Former republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty will tell me if he  thinks Senator Sanders can beat Hillary Clinton in California. He is with  me next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If you promise not to  tell Secretary Clinton, she is getting very nervous lately and I don't  want, I don't want to add to her anxiety. So if you promise not to tell  her, we're going to win here in California on June 7th.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  California primary is on Tuesday. Hillary Clinton's campaign wants  to avoid an embarrassing loss to Senator Sanders in the golden state. </p><p>A new Hoover Foundation poll shows that Clinton with a commanding lead, 51  to 38 percent. But last week another poll showed the democratic candidates  in a statistical dead heat. </p><p>Clinton is cutting short scheduled New Jersey stops to get to California  for a full five days. With me now, former republican presidential  candidate, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty. He is current Trump  supporter. </p><p>Governor, glad to see you. If Senator Sanders beats Hillary Clinton in  California, what does that mean, if anything, for the general election in  November? </p><p>TIM PAWLENTY, FORMER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR:  Well, if you accept the  proposition that she is going to be the nominee, and I think that's clear  that she will be, he is looking for leverage and the ability to advance  some agenda or some position that I presume he is interested in. </p><p>But winning California at least gives him a chance to go to those unpledged  delegates, the so-called super delegates and what I think is a rigged  system by the way, and try to say hey, look, I won the biggest state. This  should change your view. I don't think that's going to work.</p><p>But, you know, he is now starting to talk about what he perhaps get out of  the convention and it gives him leverage, basically. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, it seems as if he wants, to your point, some sort of role,  whether it's influencing policy or perhaps having a bigger say than he  normally would have in a V.P. pick? </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, there is some speculation that he may want to be the V.P.  pick. I don't know that Hillary Clinton would select him. But I doubt that  he is interested in just having a, you know, outsized voice on the platform  committee or on a few issues in the context of a convention. </p><p>I suggest he is going to be looking for more specific, more concrete  commitments from Secretary Clinton than that. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Governor, let me ask you, since we're speaking about Hillary  Clinton and her candidacy, there is a new Rasmussen poll, which shows 50  percent of all voters think she should continue to run even if she is  indicted in connection to the e-mail investigation. Does that surprise you  at all? </p><p>PAWLENTY:  It does surprise me, although the country is so polarized and  large chunk of the population have become so -- in their political silos  that the fact that they won't abandon her even if she is indicted, it tells  you a lot about how polarized the country, but yes, that is surprising.  You'd think more people would bail on her if she gets indicted. </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes. That seems like a pretty strong, a pretty strong black eye. </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  But Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, he is actually  acknowledged that the private e-mail system was a mistake, but separately  he says she has taken responsibility for it. Has she? </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, here's the -- her defense, Deirdre, for always had been on  public relations level, they weren't labeled as secured, you know,  sensitive information at the time. </p><p>But the fact of the matter is, given her position and her experience and  her seasoning she should have known that these were classified documents.  So, they didn't need to be labeled for her to know. </p><p>And if you recklessly stored them or knowingly transmitted to somebody  without the right security clearance that's a violation. And I think the  FBI is going to be in very difficult spot. Because I think there was a  violation. I'm not sure they are going to want to indict her on the eve of  election when she is a leading candidate for president. </p><p>BOLTON:  But it certainly at least hurting her credibility even among  democratic voters who were looking for a strong candidate which may end up  being to Trump's benefit? </p><p>PAWLENTY:  No question. </p><p>BOLTON:  Thank you. Governor Tim Pawlenty joining me there. Glad to have  you with me. </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Thank you. </p><p>BOLTON:  Media bias alert, one writer crying foul after he says liberal web  site Huffington Post pulled his anti-Hillary headline. We'll tell what you  it was and what Huffpo is saying about the decision. </p><p>Also, Katie Couric produce an anti-gun violence documentary. We invited one  of the pro-gun participants on to talk about what he says were bias edit.  After he spoke on the show to me, Katie Couric is apologizing. Her comments  are next. </p><p>PHILIP VAN CLEEVE, GUN ADVOCATE INTERVIEWED BY COURIC:  Once I saw what she  did, after I put the teeth back in my head, that she had the temerity to do  something like that, I decided that we need to let the world know because  that's unacceptable.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  The online publication Huffington Post published and then removed  a blog post about Hillary Clinton. So, the article was about the FBI's  plans to pursue an indictment against her on federal racketeering charges. </p><p>The writer, who is freelance, told Breitbart News that he is baffled as to  why his blog was deleted and he is waiting for an explanation from the  publication. </p><p>My power panel is back. Jillian, Mercedes and Holly. Jillian, what does  this say to you? Does it just proof that the bias is out there? Supposedly  this freelance writer supports Senator Sanders. I don't know if that's true  or false but that's the contextual point. </p><p>MELCHIOR:  Well, there is lot we don't know. And it's funny we're talking  about this. So, I was at brunch pop up on my Twitter feed. And we're all  going like do we re-tweet it. Who knows if it's right or not? </p><p>But I think the bottom line is that any publications prerogative to make  editorial choices about what they publish or don't publish. We don't know  if the story is true. But time will tell whether the story is true. And  either be Huffington Post editors going who we shut that down or they are  going to miss a heck of the scoop. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Mercedes, speaking on what Jillian said, I mean, it was a blog  post which also implies a certain informality, right, versus actual printed  word. What is your take? </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Sure. Well, I mean, I think you need to understand where the  Huffington Post is coming from. When you look at founder, Arianna  Huffington, she made it very clear, in fact, she has an editor's disclaimer  talking about the fact that Donald Trump is a serial liar or rapist and  xenophobe. </p><p>Plus, we know that on MSNBC Arianna came out and said that this connection  with Clinton Foundation, really that whole issue quote, unquote, \"doesn't  matter.\" So, there is clearly a bias from the top down. And I think that's  very reflective on how the coverage is in the Huffington Post. </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes, it is indeed. I want to ask you about another controversy.  This one surrounds a documentary, and this is about gun violence. So, news  anchor Katie Couric, did the interviews in the piece. She is also the  executive producer, essentially meaning she picked up the bulk of the price  of production. </p><p>She and her producer faced criticism for heavy editing. She has since made  a statement, quote, \"I take responsibility for a decision that  misrepresented an exchange I had with members of the Virginia Citizens  Defense League when I was screened an early version of the film with the  director, Stephanie Soechtig, I questioned her and the editor about the  pause.\" </p><p>\"I was told that a beat was added for, as she described it, dramatic  effect. I went back, reviewed it and agreed that those eight seconds do not  accurately represent their response.\" </p><p>Last week, we had the gun advocate on with us who leaked the documentary's  unedited audio. Here is what he told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLEEVE:  That film intentionally made it look like there was no answer,  that we, on the pro-gun side had no answer to that question. And there were  plenty of answers to it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Jillian, Mercedes, and Holly back with me now. So, Holly, I'm  coming to you, Couric admits the mistake. I mean, eight seconds is not a  pause in any editor's language and it does takes away from the credibility  of the whole piece. So, does this prove a bias that often goes in your  favor as democrat, Holly? </p><p>SHULMAN:  You know, honestly, I think that the actual answer from the  released audio is even worse than the silence. What they said in the  answer, was that anyone as long as they're not in jail, so that means  perpetrators of domestic violence, that means mental health, people with  history of mental health issues, felons, terrorists should have access to a  gun. </p><p>And so, honestly like...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  I think though in the piece to be fair the idea was that, all  those categories are screened in a different way. It was a discussion of  which database is tracking sales background checks and all categories that  you just mentioned. </p><p>SHULMAN:  Yes. So, I think that, you know, Katie Couric said that she  apologized. I don't think that there was any bad intent here. And she has  made that clear. But, you know, I think that the actual answers are things  that the American people have to hear because that's what they should be  making their judgment on. And I think that those views are pretty far out  of the mainstream. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Jillian is shaking her head.. </p><p>MELCHOIR:  Yes. It's a lot easier to hear that if you don't have deceptive  eight seconds silence. </p><p>SCHLAPP: That's right.</p><p>MELCHOIR:  I mean, we want both sides represented. Editing in silence that  didn't exist before is not the way to have honest discussion about that.  And the fact that she thought maybe that would be the way to put that in  represented in the documentary, I think that is indicative of fear of an  argument. </p><p>BOLTON:  Well, it seems as well that she probably didn't count on the  participants running their own audio copy to be able to show as they say,  and not tell exactly what happens. We're grateful that the guests came on. </p><p>Thank you all. Thanks for the conversation. </p><p>MELCHOIR:  Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON:  Holly, Mercedes, and Jillian, glad you're here.</p><p>Former U.S. Attorney General, Eric Holder changing his opinions on Edward  Snowden's revelations. Holder now saying that Snowden performed a public  service. I will ask Colonel Ralph Peters what he thinks of the change in  stance and what it means for the U.S. A.G.'s legacy since Snowden as a  reminder has been charged with espionage. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC HOLDER, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  He actually performed a public  service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we  made.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC HOLDER, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Snowden did what he did, but I  think that he actually performed a public service by raising the debate  that we engaged in and by the changes that we made. Now I would say doing  what he did, and the way he did it, was inappropriate and illegal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST:  Former U.S. Attorney General Eric  Holder changing his stance on Edward Snowden. Snowden leaked classified  information about the U.S. government the way that it functioned  specifically the NSA. </p><p>He has been charged with espionage. Snowden reacted on Twitter saying, \"The  U.S.'s stance on what he did is getting more and more lenient as time goes  on.\" You can read that, it's treason, maybe not, but it was reckless, still  technically it was unlawful, it's public continues but, and he continues. </p><p>With me now, Fox News strategic analyst retired Lieutenant Colonel Ralph  Peters. Colonel, thanks as always for being with me. What do you think  about U.S. A.G. Eric Holder making a statement like, it wasn't so bad after  all. I mean, Snowden did put some people in danger. </p><p>RALPH PETERS, FOX NEWS STRATEGIC ANALYST:  No, he killed people. These were  scandalous words from a scoundrel. Eric Holder's legacy as attorney general  his primary legacy is going to be dead cops. </p><p>Remember he's the guy that vilified the police while portraying young  thugs, violent thugs almost as heroes. Now he wants to pronounce on  Snowden. There was no debate here, there was a shouting match. He was  utterly unfair and he left out the fact that Snowden didn't leak this stuff  to the New York Times. </p><p>Snowden gave it to the Chinese and the Russians and put it out there all  around the world. Terrorists. You know, Islamists learned how we were  collecting data, they changed their patterns, we made it tougher to locate  the terrorists, and knows the terrorists killed people. </p><p>The Russians, the Chinese, other enemies of the United States learned about  multibillion dollar technical programs that were never, never aimed against  American citizens, they were aimed against our enemies. </p><p>And by the way, Deirdre, you know, since the Snowden case just broke, I  have challenged everyone, left, right, and here abroad, give me the name of  one single law-abiding American citizen who was harmed in any way by any  NSA program. Over three years now nobody can give me a single name. It was  all lies. </p><p>BOLTON:  That's a great question and a great point. I'm assuming this is  because Edward Snowden wants to come back to the U.S. and somehow the Obama  administration or U.S. A.G. Eric Holder is trying to lay the groundwork so  that becomes possible.</p><p>But to your point, Russia didn't really accept them just because they were  friendly. </p><p>PETERS:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  He was given information. </p><p>PETERS:  You're absolutely right. In a sense what Holder is trying to do  now is he's out of office is what President Obama and Valerie Derrick tried  to do with Bowe Bergdahl to whitewash somebody who betrayed a fundamental  trust. </p><p>It just seems that this administration and those affiliated with it don't  really have much respect for the genuine heroes but, boy, they've got time  for the Bergdahl's and the Snowden's, and it really it's a disgrace but  it's also just a sad, sad thing. </p><p>BOLTON:  Let me ask you on a related matter how to do with tech companies,  Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft, that pledging to tackle online  hate speech to combat the use of social media by terrorists. </p><p>But is this strong enough? I mean, can these companies make a difference?  There are a lot of people who say that the tech companies have done a lot  more to prevent other crimes, which is great, but for some reason there is  this last wall in somehow protecting people who want to reach out and  encourage others to do harm? </p><p>PETERS:  Well, first these big tech companies, Facebook, Twitter, Google,  Microsoft - they're not doing it out of patriotism, they're doing it  because the European Union is basically forced them to and they're  protecting market share. </p><p>Myself, I am, Deirdre, I would love to see true hate speech especially from  Islamist terrorists removed from the web. The web is a great recruiting  tool, and operational tool for terrorists and other bad guys. </p><p>But my concern is who gets to decide what's hate speech. For instance, if  on this show I tell you that I believe, as I do, that extremist Islamist  terrorists have to be killed, that they can't be reformed, well, in  Germany, that might qualify as hate speech. </p><p>Does that mean that Google blocks Fox News insider? You know, it just who  gets to decide? Thomas Payne incited violence, some of Jefferson's remarks  could be banned. Now, again, I'm not arguing against banning Islamic hate  speech, I'm just saying that the devil, like the Jihad is in the details. </p><p>BOLTON:  It makes all the sense in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Ralph  Peters, thank you always for your insight. </p><p>PETERS:  Love being on the show, Deirdre. It's a great show. </p><p>BOLTON:  We love having you. Thank you. </p><p>Coming up, a possible road rage incident caught on tape. A vehicle  literally driving over a veteran's motorcycle. My next guest says he may  actually have a legal defense. </p><p>Police, by the way, investigating the circumstances of the Ohio gorilla's  death. Find out from a legal standpoint which party is reliable. The zoo or  the boy's parents? Our legal eagles are going to weigh in next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THANE MAYNARD, CINCINNATI ZOO DIRECTOR:  We did not take the shooting of  Harambe lightly. But the child's life was in danger. And people who  question that who are Monday morning quarterbacks, or second-guessers don't  understand that you can't take a risk with a silver back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  The Cincinnati Zoo director is defending its decision to shoot and  kill a 400-pound rare gorilla, after a four-year-old boy fell 15 feet into  the enclosure on Saturday. </p><p>Meanwhile, animal rights activists are upset with the decision, they have  created an online petition in memory of the gorilla. It calls for the  child's parents to be investigated and held liable for negligence. The  petition has gathered more than 100,000 signatures. </p><p>Attorneys Diana Aizman and Harleigh Tensen with me now. Welcome to you  both. I'm glad you're here because that was frightening video for starters. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Absolutely. </p><p>BOLTON:  And this is a really interesting case. So, again, just from a  legal perspective, Diana, who is more liable, the zoo? The parents?  Neither? </p><p>DIANA AIZMAN, ATTORBEY:  So, at this point, it looks like the zoo did  everything they were supposed to do as far as the barrier, how the barrier  was set up. It was in line with the regulations that surround that. </p><p>And it seems that they made a decision that was aided by a team that made  the assessment. They decided that they need to end the gorilla's life in  order to save the life of the small child. So, it seems like they did what  they were supposed to do. </p><p>BOLTON:  Can, I'm just saying, rightly or wrongly, and I heard the  director, for one thing he made the right call. That matters. But what  about this animal rights activists are they able to bring a lawsuit against  the zoo? </p><p>HARLEIGH TENSEN, ATTORNEY:  They are not because they don't have standing.  The zoo is property -- I'm sorry, the gorilla is property. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>TENSEN:  So, loss of property.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BOLTON:  Well, let me take care.</p><p>TENSEN:  Exactly. And it's troubling and upsetting but they won't -- they  do not have standing to sue. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, what about these animal rights activists who are also  petitioning that the parents basically be charged with negligence. Is that  going to stand up? </p><p>AIZMAN:  You know it's hard to say. At this point it's too early to put  that kind of label on this. I think that it is appropriate for them to go  in and investigate the situation, make a determination whether or not this  was an isolated incident of negligence or if this was sort of a pattern of  behavior where this mother is losing track of her child. </p><p>BOLTON:  Because that happens essentially to all parents at some moment you  lose track of your child. </p><p>AIZMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  However, this enclosure looks pretty set up to keep people and  animals apart. </p><p>TENSEN:  Which is why I think it took more than three seconds for this boy  to find a way through the enclosure and through the barricade. I understand  you turn your head, accidents happen. But I think he really had to be  searching around for a way to get into the enclosure.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>TENSEN:  We're with the parent then. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Speaking of this topic, celebrity zoo keeper Jack Hanna  is defending the Cincinnati Zoo's decision to kill the gorilla. He is going  to be with me shortly to talk about it. </p><p>But I want to ask you to another legal question. Because look at this  video, it's a hit-and-run in Florida, it shows the vehicle driving over a  veteran's motorcycle in a suspected road rage incident. </p><p>So, the driver arrested on aggravated battery with a deadly weapon charge,  driving without a valid driver's license. But is there anyway, I mean, when  you look at this, it's horrifying. But does the driver is some lawyer going  to take the case of the driver and argue successfully on his behalf? </p><p>TENSEN:  Absolutely. I think they could. There is so much we don't know. Is  the video horrifying? It is. But we don't know if there was a steering  malfunction. We don't know if the driver was provoked. </p><p>BOLTON:  We are assuming it's road rage, but that's a great point. That  could be an assumption. </p><p>AIZMAN:  OK. So you know what's really, really difficulty when you're a  criminal defense attorney is when you have an actual videotape of your  client committing a crime. That makes defending somebody incredible  challenging. </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes. Because you see that and you're like, oh, my God.</p><p>AIZMAN:  Yes. That mean it looks from what I'm watching, it looks like a  guy behind the wheel who drove his vehicle on purpose over a motorcycle  that had someone on it. </p><p>TENSEN:  How can you say that was on purpose just based on the video? You  can't say that that was on purpose. The intent isn't there based on the  video alone </p><p>AIZMAN:  Right. And if he kept driving forward, I'd say maybe there were  some issue with his health or maybe he was having some sort of a medical  episode and he lost track of the vehicle, but that doesn't appear to be  what's happening here. He then drove off. He corrects the course and then  drives off. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  So, but, Harleigh, I hear what you're saying, there's defense for  anything. What if the motive -- I don't know. What if there was some road  tension, meaning like the motorcycle is too close, who knows, was too close  to the car, aggravating them. It still doesn't give the rights for the car  driver to hit him on purpose. </p><p>TENSEN:  Of course not.</p><p>BOLTON:  Even if he provoked it. </p><p>TENSEN:  Of course not. But we still don't know if it was intentional. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>TENSEN:  He drove away, people get in accidents, they get scared, and they  drive away. That doesn't mean he intentionally brand it. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Would you want to represent him? </p><p>TENSEN:  I would absolutely represent him. </p><p>BOLTON:  You would? </p><p>TENSEN:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Diana? </p><p>AIZMAN:  I would represent him. Absolutely. I mean, everybody in this  country is entitled to a fair criminal defense. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. There we go. Two pros legal eagles. Diana and Harleigh,  thank you so much. Glad to have you.</p><p>TENSEN:  Thank you. </p><p>BOLTON:  Major automakers racing to get the first driverless car to market.  A new report says a rush will make them more hackable than ever. We're  going to bring you details, next. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here we go, start moving, sending brake command. Stops. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here we go, starting our slow five-mile-an-hour cruise.  Sending the command. And we brake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Driverless cars may provide more opportunity for hackers. Some are  proving there are ways to control brakes, engines and other components  remotely. </p><p>My next guest says that security risk isn't the only one. MIT tech reviews  San Francisco bureau chief, Tom Simonite is with me now. Welcome, Tom. Why  are driverless cars more of a security risk than human driven ones? </p><p>TOM SIMONITE, MIT TECH REVIEWS CHIEF:  Hi, nice to be here. If you speak to  anyone who works in security, they would tell you that adding more  computers to something makes it more hackable. There are just more things  that can go wrong. </p><p>When things are hooked up to the internet, of course that provides a way in  for an attacker. And it's clear to make cars drive themselves, you need to  add a lot of computers to these vehicles, you know, as well as all the  equipment to control different components. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK, but you're saying that in addition to those potential  breaches, there are other issues. I know you're out in California, I assume  you have visited some of the places that are testing these driverless cars.  What are you seeing? What are you hearing? </p><p>SIMONITE:  Yes, that's right. I mean, if you're here in the Bay Area, you  just need to visit the right stretch of the 101 freeway and you can see  Google's cars out and testing on public roads. This is a very exciting  technology. </p><p>I think a lot of us are ready to give up driving and lean back and relax.  There are a lot of safety benefits. Some of like 30,000 people die on U.S.  roads every year, maybe we can cut that. </p><p>This is moving fast. You know, Google just announced that it's opening a  new testing facility outside of Detroit where it work with Chrysler on some  self-driving minivans and Toyota and some of the comment they say they want  to have autonomous cars by 2020. </p><p>So, there's a lot of optimism in the industry but there are questions about  how exactly we're going to get there to the state where you know, you and I  can safely text in our car and not have to pay attention to where we're  going. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, when you speak with the experts, what are they telling you?  What are their biggest challenges right now? </p><p>SIMONITE:  So, the biggest challenges are around the complicated urban  driving that we do which often involves a lot of thinking and so much like  a social act. If you're in an urban environment, you might be making eye  contact with other drivers. You might be in situations where a road is  closed and there were cops standing out in the road telling you where you  need to go. </p><p>Computers and, you know, robotic equipment is great when it comes to making  quick reactions to, say, somebody is in front of the car, but computers  aren't there with the commonsense that is needed to decode some of this  difficult urban situations. </p><p>BOLTON:  Right. So, human brain are still for the moment slightly stronger  than machine ones, which is good to be sure of from time to time even  though I know that humans are the ones programming all the artificial  intelligence tools. </p><p>We take the point, nonetheless. Thank you, Tom. </p><p>SIMONITE:  Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON:  Tom Simonite with me there from MIT tech review.</p><p>Well, Fox News is now confirming that conservative writer Bill Kristol is  eyeing conservative lawyer Weekly Standard editor David French for an  independent presidential run, third party, against Donald Trump. </p><p>Kristol is part of the hash tag never Trump campaign, and he previously was  pushing for Mitt Romney.</p><p>When we come back, animal rights activists are crying foul. They're holding  a vigil for the slain gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo that was shot to  protect the boy. </p><p>Celebrity zoo keeper Jack Hanna disagrees saying the caretaker's decision  to save the boy's life was the right one.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mommy's right here! </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, my God!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  A 4-year-old boy fell into a rare gorilla's enclosure at the  Cincinnati Zoo. The zoo's director made the decision to shoot the gorilla  to save the child. Some animal activists disagree and are crying.</p><p>Columbus Zoo director and TV host, Jack Hanna says the zoo director made  the right call. Jack, we are so glad to speak with you. Thanks for the  time. As a director of a zoo also in Ohio, this hits super close to home.  What is your take on the situation? </p><p>JACK HANNA, COLUMBUS ZOO DIRECTOR EMERITUS:  Well, at the Columbus Zoo the  first gorilla in the world that they were boarding here because we only  have 20 gorillas boarding here to survive. The oldest living gorilla in the  world lives here too.</p><p>So, you can see how we've worked with gorillas for over 30-something year.  I have a home in Rwanda that which is only two miles from mountain gorillas  since for the last 20 years. So, I'm not an expert in any means. But I can  tell you this. </p><p>I've witnessed gorillas both in the zoo and the wild, I can tell you also  when I first saw this on TV, when the child is there, all of a sudden he  jerks the child, he goes through there, you heard the noise in my ear just  now, but the people are screaming and stuff, you got a gorilla there  silverback by the way. </p><p>They now had this human in there and all of a sudden they do the alarm  call. All this family the women or the girl gorillas go in the building. He  was out; he was there in the building something sit in the moat, people  screaming. </p><p>All of a sudden he drags that child. That's a dead giveaway for me. And I  always says this because I witnessed it in the wild. I witnessed it in the  zoological parks. I'm telling you that child would not be here today if  they waited. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Jack, you know obviously a lot more about these animals. Are  saying by the fact that female gorillas went in, people were screaming,  that the silverback his whole job is to protect his tribe so you're saying  wuth that in mind he would have killed the child. </p><p>HANNA:  Yes. I'm telling you that right now when he did that actually, now  I saw that face on the animal that is a face you don't want to see and  especially a silverback. Then a female maybe little sit on that situation.</p><p>But right now this animal is confused. He's upset. Now somebody would say,  well, why don't you tranquilize the animal by the way. That's a whole  different world, everybody. How about you getting in that moat there, let's  say that kid starting fighting that gorilla after a few minutes. Everybody  that want to wait.</p><p>You cannot wait in a situation like this. I have seen a gorilla -- a  gorilla definitely like you saw there take a green coconut that you can't  bust it with a hatchet and go like it and squeeze it.</p><p>What I'm saying is all you had to don't, it'd actually with like this start  screaming fight again, what do you think he would have done that child. You  don't want to watch...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  he would consider it an attack or a threat what you're saying here  what he did.</p><p>HANNA:  Of course. Yes. And you might know you have a human being in here.  And by the way, everyone says how they love the gorillas. It's very simple.  Why do they love the gorillas? Because they have seen them in zoos, they  haven't seen them in the wild. You know, many people if you get to see a  gorilla in the wild you can't count them probably, you know, it's a hard  thing to do. It's very expensive thing to do. </p><p>I've been very blessed to be able to film these for 30-some years. And I'm  just saying that you have human life and animal life. You know, we have  something here which are not...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  I agree with your point.</p><p>HANNA:  It's just a no-win situation for anybody. </p><p>BOLTON:  Jack, we thank you so much. Thank you for sharing your insights. </p><p>HANNA:  Thank you. All right. </p><p>BOLTON:  Jack Hanna with me there. Thank you for joining us here on Risk &amp;  Reward. Making Money with Charles Payne starts now.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>speaking from Trump tower about his donations to veteran's charities.</p><p>This is Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Deirdre Bolton.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>says he raised close to $6 million for veterans organizations and named ones that received money. He says that if he is president he will hit back at the press if they write false stories just as he will hit back at party leaders that don't support him.</p><p>With me now, Katrina Pierson, Trump campaign spokesperson. Katrina, welcome back. Glad to see you.</p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Great to be here. Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Trump supporters admire his fighting spirit. Rush Limbaugh started his radio show this morning with this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST: People have been begging for all republican to just once take on the media the way Trump did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Katrina, how much feedback on that 40-minute press conference are you getting?</p><p>PIERSON: Tons of feedback. You know, my inbox is so full right now from so many people across the country saying finally, this is one of those situations where, when Mr. Trump held this, when he held this fund-raiser, this was a spontaneous fund-raiser put it together within 24 hours.</p><p>We had been saying it will take a little bit of time to vet some of these organizations to bring in the money that was pledged by the way, not on hand. And for weeks, and almost every day we heard about the veterans fund- raisers and where is the money.</p><p>Mr. Trump is not politician. Mr. Trump has been doing things for people his whole life. So, this idea that somehow there was some animus reason that Mr. Trump did this, I mean, it really showed today in the media is now covering of the actual fund-raiser really goes to show, and people are so fed up and frustrated with the hypocrisy on the way republicans are covered versus the way democrats are covered or lack there off.</p><p>BOLTON: So you feel like there is clearly a bias, but speaking of democrats, Hillary Clinton's campaigns is planning series of events to take on Trump's record on vet's issues.</p><p>So, her campaign apparently is going to have speakers who are all vets, I should state in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire, Florida, Colorado, so all battleground states. Are you planning to counter that counter?</p><p>PIERSON: Well, I'm sure we will. I mean, this is one of those -- one of those issues that Mr. Trump has been extremely strong on. And, you know, there are two groups of people that I've seen personally Mr. Trump get a little emotional about.</p><p>And that is veterans who have been treated completely unfairly. When you have illegal aliens that are getting treatment faster than veterans that's absurd. And this is a Hillary Clinton policy by the way, someone that's been in office, someone that has been in public life, the first lady being a senator and Secretary of State and has done what for veterans?</p><p>Absolutely nothing. This is something close to Mr. Trump's heart. And over the campaign trail when he saw an opportunity to do something for veterans, he did it. He took action. And that's the kind of leader that we need.</p><p>BOLTON: Now speaking of fighting, so he's obviously fighting Hillary Clinton and it looks like that is going to be the match up in November, although TBD on the democratic side but he is still fighting within the party.</p><p>I mean, he tweeted out his response to Bill Kristol calling for a strong independent third party candidate. He says, \"The Republican Party has to be smart and strong if it wants win in November. Can't allow lightweight,\" so everyone assumes the reference to Kristol, \"to set up a spoiler in the candidate.\"</p><p>And then he also tweeted, \"If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get as spoiler to run as independent, say good-bye to the Supreme Court.\" But aside from Bill Kristol, aside from Mitt Romney and we are pretty sure that Bill Kristol has Mitt Romney in mind, how is the unification plan going from your point of view?</p><p>PIERSON: Well, the way you pose the question is exactly what's happening. The party is with Mr. Trump. He has broken a record in GOP primary turnout. And there is just handful of republicans, establishment republicans who want status quo. They want to keep things the same. And they know we'll have that with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>But for the most part Mr. Trump is unifying the party. Reince Priebus, chairman of the RNC said it's time to get behind the front-runner. We have so many people with the RNC and in the states, we now have state chairman coming on board.</p><p>So, this unification process is moving along, particularly now that we've now several endorsements on the Hill, whether congressional chairman or just other members in the party. Those who don't want to get on board are those who want to keep the things the same way.</p><p>And those who have been rejected twice now by the people, Mr. Trump transcends party even though he's unifying Republican Party, he is unifying the American people with a pro-America message.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. But one thing I wanted to ask when you talk about pro-America and unification, there are some who say he unfairly went after New Mexico Governor Susanna Martinez, and it relates to what I want to ask you about.</p><p>Because he is going after the judge who is ordering the release of the Trump University documents, bringing up the judge's Mexican heritage. Here is the comment. I just want to circle back with you after.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I have a judge who is a hater of <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>a hater. He is a hater.</p><p>(CROWD BOOING)</p><p>His name is, Gonzalo Curiel, the judge who happened to be, we believe Mexican which is great. I think that's fine. You know what he what? I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>when I give all these jobs, OK?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, on one hand should the judge recuse himself and on the other hand, how do you see <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>outreach to the Latino population?</p><p>PIERSON: Well, look, this judge is a problem. He does not like Mr. Trump. This is activist judge appointed by Barack Obama because Barack Obama wouldn't appoint anyone other than an activist judge.</p><p>And there was great article just released today in the American Spectator that gives specific details about this judge. And the simple fact that he is the friend of the lawyer on the opposite side. So, he should absolutely recuse himself.</p><p>But it's important that Mr. Trump mention that for a reason because we do see a lot of these anti-Trump protesters who are very much pushing the anti-American message of the way they're behaving at some of the rallies on the outside and waving the Mexican flag. They're holding up La Raza signs.</p><p>These are very much important details that the mainstream media is leaving out. So it's going to be up to Mr. Trump to get that word out.</p><p>BOLTON: And just to finish the point, what do you make of the relationship with the governor of New Mexico, Martinez?</p><p>PIERSON: Look, Governor Martinez was a never Trumper to begin with. I mean, she has said things publicly against Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump is a counterpuncher.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So some people think she would be a great V.P.</p><p>PIERSON: Well, not Mr. Trump, obviously. But look, Mr. Trump doesn't see party. He doesn't see race, and he doesn't see gender. He just wants to do what is right for the country. He wants to get back to common sense government. And he is counterpuncher.</p><p>She criticized him, he criticized her. And just because she is a woman or just because she is Latino means nothing. Mr. Trump is going to treat everyone the same and it's been that way from the beginning.</p><p>BOLTON: It certainly has been. Katrina, thank you. Glad to have you with us.</p><p>PIERSON: Great to be here.</p><p>BOLTON: Katrina Pierson joining me there, she is a spokesperson for the <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>campaign.</p><p>Well, with more on the subject, how <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>handled the media on his donations to veterans, he did turn over the microphone to a vet from New Hampshire. Here are that vet's comments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL BALDASARO, VETERAN: Stop using veterans as political pawns. You got a guy outside, McCoy, go do a Google search on his Facebook. He is out there, his picture is with the Clintons. They are using veterans as political pawns and it must stop.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is doing this from the heart. You're all focused on the way he is raising money and you're not looking at 22 veterans that are killing each other every day. You're not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on wait lists.</p><p>Look at his plan on his Trump web site. He talks about medical cards. He talks about fixing the V.A. He talks about competition. I think the liberal media and I've been dealing with you a long time and get your head out of your butt and focus on the real issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: My political power panel is here. Jillian Melcher, Heat Street political editor, republican strategist, Mercedes Schlapp; and democratic strategist Holly Shulman. Welcome to you all. So, Gillian, in your view how did Trump handle the press conference?</p><p>JILLIAN MELCHIOR, HEAT STREET POLITICAL EDITOR: I don't think he handled it wonderfully. I mean, it's great for the Washington Post to follow up on this. He made a commitment to help veterans to support them that was widely viewed...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: So, I just want to cut you off so everybody else follows.</p><p>MELCHIOR; Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: So, many people saw this 40-minute press conference as response to a piece written in the Washington Post which was essentially, was not titled, where is the money but that is essentially the point of the piece.</p><p>MELCHIOR: Exactly, they could not find a single veteran's organizations that had received one the $1 million that Trump said he'd given. So, there is a lot of speculation, a lot of question. All of sudden Trump produces the check. He says it's supposed to be about scrutiny about vetting the charity...</p><p>BOLTON: But he has given out more than three million.</p><p>MELCHIOR: Well, he ended up doing it, but he's saying that vetting is the reason for four-month delay.</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>MELCHIOR: But he ended up giving it to a guy who runs a charity, who's not only running charity, he works for the SoHo Trump. So, this is somebody within his own corporation. I think the vetting excuse doesn't hold water.</p><p>I think he needs to be held accountable for this and it's fair for The Washington Post reporters to ask these questions.</p><p>BOLTON: But in fairness, I take all your point, in fairness to Trump, he got out there and pretty much delineated Excel's spreadsheet line, by spreadsheet line, where the money came from, where it's going. Mercedes, what is your take?</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, I've got to tell you I'm still waiting to see how much money Hillary Clinton has given to any of the vets. Let's be realistic here.</p><p>This is a guy who made a promise that he was going to give millions of dollars to veterans groups. I've never really seen a presidential candidate take such interest in insuring that these veterans get the help that they need.</p><p>With that being said, I do believe that he has a special connections with the veterans groups. I think that he is true to his word. I think when you look at Hillary Clinton and the fact that she's made millions of dollars off of these Wall Street speeches, and yet, she is trying to hit <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>on the fact of whether he is giving the money or how much money he has given? Fine.</p><p>I think that it's the media's responsibility to, yes, check and make sure that he is delivering on his promise but at the same time, I mean, he is taking an unconventional approach which Hillary Clinton doesn't even know how to respond to.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Holly, since you're our democratic voice, what is your take on that, especially in light of the Clinton campaign planning this whole series of counterattacks if we're going to call them that for the next few days to try to reach out to veterans?</p><p>HOLLY SHULMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: One thing has been clear through this whole process and that's <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>only cares about veterans when it's politically expedient for him. And that's what we've seen today.</p><p>Hillary Clinton, despite the political benefits has reached across the aisle, worked with Senator John McCain for $50 million for veterans rehab center in Texas. She's worked with Lindsey Graham to expand health care for reservists, for National Guard.</p><p>And she has a career of working on these issues and fighting for veterans. And if he wants to make this an issue in the campaign I would say, bring it on.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. We're going to have more to talk about. Jillian, Mercedes, Holly all back with me. In the meantime, we want to let you know <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>dismissing libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson as a fringe candidate earlier today.</p><p>Mr. Johnson will be Kennedy's guest tonight. Tune in. You do not want to miss the conversation, 8 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Looking at the markets averages on mix, the last straight day of the month. The Dow, NASDAQ, and the S&amp;P, all up for May, making the Dow and the S&amp;P 500's longest monthly winning streak in two years. If you look at the leading groups, tech, health care and finance.</p><p>Well, next Tuesday the all-important California primary on the democratic side. It is getting too close for comfort. Hillary Clinton canceling a New Jersey event to head out to the Golden State early.</p><p>Former republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty will tell me if he thinks Senator Sanders can beat Hillary Clinton in California. He is with me next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you promise not to tell Secretary Clinton, she is getting very nervous lately and I don't want, I don't want to add to her anxiety. So if you promise not to tell her, we're going to win here in California on June 7th.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: California primary is on Tuesday. Hillary Clinton's campaign wants to avoid an embarrassing loss to Senator Sanders in the golden state.</p><p>A new Hoover Foundation poll shows that Clinton with a commanding lead, 51 to 38 percent. But last week another poll showed the democratic candidates in a statistical dead heat.</p><p>Clinton is cutting short scheduled New Jersey stops to get to California for a full five days. With me now, former republican presidential candidate, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty. He is current Trump supporter.</p><p>Governor, glad to see you. If Senator Sanders beats Hillary Clinton in California, what does that mean, if anything, for the general election in November?</p><p>TIM PAWLENTY, FORMER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR: Well, if you accept the proposition that she is going to be the nominee, and I think that's clear that she will be, he is looking for leverage and the ability to advance some agenda or some position that I presume he is interested in.</p><p>But winning California at least gives him a chance to go to those unpledged delegates, the so-called super delegates and what I think is a rigged system by the way, and try to say hey, look, I won the biggest state. This should change your view. I don't think that's going to work.</p><p>But, you know, he is now starting to talk about what he perhaps get out of the convention and it gives him leverage, basically.</p><p>BOLTON: So, it seems as if he wants, to your point, some sort of role, whether it's influencing policy or perhaps having a bigger say than he normally would have in a V.P. pick?</p><p>PAWLENTY: Well, there is some speculation that he may want to be the V.P. pick. I don't know that Hillary Clinton would select him. But I doubt that he is interested in just having a, you know, outsized voice on the platform committee or on a few issues in the context of a convention.</p><p>I suggest he is going to be looking for more specific, more concrete commitments from Secretary Clinton than that.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Governor, let me ask you, since we're speaking about Hillary Clinton and her candidacy, there is a new Rasmussen poll, which shows 50 percent of all voters think she should continue to run even if she is indicted in connection to the e-mail investigation. Does that surprise you at all?</p><p>PAWLENTY: It does surprise me, although the country is so polarized and large chunk of the population have become so -- in their political silos that the fact that they won't abandon her even if she is indicted, it tells you a lot about how polarized the country, but yes, that is surprising. You'd think more people would bail on her if she gets indicted.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. That seems like a pretty strong, a pretty strong black eye.</p><p>PAWLENTY: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: But Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, he is actually acknowledged that the private e-mail system was a mistake, but separately he says she has taken responsibility for it. Has she?</p><p>PAWLENTY: Well, here's the -- her defense, Deirdre, for always had been on public relations level, they weren't labeled as secured, you know, sensitive information at the time.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is, given her position and her experience and her seasoning she should have known that these were classified documents. So, they didn't need to be labeled for her to know.</p><p>And if you recklessly stored them or knowingly transmitted to somebody without the right security clearance that's a violation. And I think the FBI is going to be in very difficult spot. Because I think there was a violation. I'm not sure they are going to want to indict her on the eve of election when she is a leading candidate for president.</p><p>BOLTON: But it certainly at least hurting her credibility even among democratic voters who were looking for a strong candidate which may end up being to Trump's benefit?</p><p>PAWLENTY: No question.</p><p>BOLTON: Thank you. Governor Tim Pawlenty joining me there. Glad to have you with me.</p><p>PAWLENTY: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Media bias alert, one writer crying foul after he says liberal web site Huffington Post pulled his anti-Hillary headline. We'll tell what you it was and what Huffpo is saying about the decision.</p><p>Also, Katie Couric produce an anti-gun violence documentary. We invited one of the pro-gun participants on to talk about what he says were bias edit. After he spoke on the show to me, Katie Couric is apologizing. Her comments are next.</p><p>PHILIP VAN CLEEVE, GUN ADVOCATE INTERVIEWED BY COURIC: Once I saw what she did, after I put the teeth back in my head, that she had the temerity to do something like that, I decided that we need to let the world know because that's unacceptable.</p><p>BOLTON: The online publication Huffington Post published and then removed a blog post about Hillary Clinton. So, the article was about the FBI's plans to pursue an indictment against her on federal racketeering charges.</p><p>The writer, who is freelance, told Breitbart News that he is baffled as to why his blog was deleted and he is waiting for an explanation from the publication.</p><p>My power panel is back. Jillian, Mercedes and Holly. Jillian, what does this say to you? Does it just proof that the bias is out there? Supposedly this freelance writer supports Senator Sanders. I don't know if that's true or false but that's the contextual point.</p><p>MELCHIOR: Well, there is lot we don't know. And it's funny we're talking about this. So, I was at brunch pop up on my Twitter feed. And we're all going like do we re-tweet it. Who knows if it's right or not?</p><p>But I think the bottom line is that any publications prerogative to make editorial choices about what they publish or don't publish. We don't know if the story is true. But time will tell whether the story is true. And either be Huffington Post editors going who we shut that down or they are going to miss a heck of the scoop.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Mercedes, speaking on what Jillian said, I mean, it was a blog post which also implies a certain informality, right, versus actual printed word. What is your take?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Sure. Well, I mean, I think you need to understand where the Huffington Post is coming from. When you look at founder, Arianna Huffington, she made it very clear, in fact, she has an editor's disclaimer talking about the fact that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is a serial liar or rapist and xenophobe.</p><p>Plus, we know that on MSNBC Arianna came out and said that this connection with Clinton Foundation, really that whole issue quote, unquote, \"doesn't matter.\" So, there is clearly a bias from the top down. And I think that's very reflective on how the coverage is in the Huffington Post.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, it is indeed. I want to ask you about another controversy. This one surrounds a documentary, and this is about gun violence. So, news anchor Katie Couric, did the interviews in the piece. She is also the executive producer, essentially meaning she picked up the bulk of the price of production.</p><p>She and her producer faced criticism for heavy editing. She has since made a statement, quote, \"I take responsibility for a decision that misrepresented an exchange I had with members of the Virginia Citizens Defense League when I was screened an early version of the film with the director, Stephanie Soechtig, I questioned her and the editor about the pause.\"</p><p>\"I was told that a beat was added for, as she described it, dramatic effect. I went back, reviewed it and agreed that those eight seconds do not accurately represent their response.\"</p><p>Last week, we had the gun advocate on with us who leaked the documentary's unedited audio. Here is what he told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLEEVE: That film intentionally made it look like there was no answer, that we, on the pro-gun side had no answer to that question. And there were plenty of answers to it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Jillian, Mercedes, and Holly back with me now. So, Holly, I'm coming to you, Couric admits the mistake. I mean, eight seconds is not a pause in any editor's language and it does takes away from the credibility of the whole piece. So, does this prove a bias that often goes in your favor as democrat, Holly?</p><p>SHULMAN: You know, honestly, I think that the actual answer from the released audio is even worse than the silence. What they said in the answer, was that anyone as long as they're not in jail, so that means perpetrators of domestic violence, that means mental health, people with history of mental health issues, felons, terrorists should have access to a gun.</p><p>And so, honestly like...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: I think though in the piece to be fair the idea was that, all those categories are screened in a different way. It was a discussion of which database is tracking sales background checks and all categories that you just mentioned.</p><p>SHULMAN: Yes. So, I think that, you know, Katie Couric said that she apologized. I don't think that there was any bad intent here. And she has made that clear. But, you know, I think that the actual answers are things that the American people have to hear because that's what they should be making their judgment on. And I think that those views are pretty far out of the mainstream.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Jillian is shaking her head..</p><p>MELCHOIR: Yes. It's a lot easier to hear that if you don't have deceptive eight seconds silence.</p><p>SCHLAPP: That's right.</p><p>MELCHOIR: I mean, we want both sides represented. Editing in silence that didn't exist before is not the way to have honest discussion about that. And the fact that she thought maybe that would be the way to put that in represented in the documentary, I think that is indicative of fear of an argument.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, it seems as well that she probably didn't count on the participants running their own audio copy to be able to show as they say, and not tell exactly what happens. We're grateful that the guests came on.</p><p>Thank you all. Thanks for the conversation.</p><p>MELCHOIR: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Holly, Mercedes, and Jillian, glad you're here.</p><p>Former U.S. Attorney General, <person><nameText>Eric Holder </nameText></person>changing his opinions on Edward Snowden's revelations.

Snowden leaked classified information about the U.S. government the way that it functioned specifically the NSA.</p><p>He has been charged with espionage. Snowden reacted on Twitter saying, \"The U.S.'s stance on what he did is getting more and more lenient as time goes on.\" You can read that, it's treason, maybe not, but it was reckless, still technically it was unlawful, it's public continues but, and he continues.</p><p>With me now, Fox News strategic analyst retired Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters. Colonel, thanks as always for being with me. What do you think about U.S. A.G. <person><nameText>Eric Holder </nameText></person>making a statement like, it wasn't so bad after all. I mean, Snowden did put some people in danger.</p><p>RALPH PETERS, FOX NEWS STRATEGIC ANALYST: No, he killed people. These were scandalous words from a scoundrel. <person><nameText>Eric Holder's </nameText></person>legacy as attorney general his primary legacy is going to be dead cops.</p><p>Remember he's the guy that vilified the police while portraying young thugs, violent thugs almost as heroes. Now he wants to pronounce on Snowden. There was no debate here, there was a shouting match. He was utterly unfair and he left out the fact that Snowden didn't leak this stuff to the New York Times.</p><p>Snowden gave it to the Chinese and the Russians and put it out there all around the world. Terrorists. You know, Islamists learned how we were collecting data, they changed their patterns, we made it tougher to locate the terrorists, and knows the terrorists killed people.</p><p>The Russians, the Chinese, other enemies of the United States learned about multibillion dollar technical programs that were never, never aimed against American citizens, they were aimed against our enemies.</p><p>And by the way, Deirdre, you know, since the Snowden case just broke, I have challenged everyone, left, right, and here abroad, give me the name of one single law-abiding American citizen who was harmed in any way by any NSA program. Over three years now nobody can give me a single name. It was all lies.</p><p>BOLTON: That's a great question and a great point. I'm assuming this is because Edward Snowden wants to come back to the U.S. and somehow the Obama administration or U.S. A.G. <person><nameText>Eric Holder </nameText></person>is trying to lay the groundwork so that becomes possible.</p><p>But to your point, Russia didn't really accept them just because they were friendly.</p><p>PETERS: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: He was given information.</p><p>PETERS: You're absolutely right. In a sense what Holder is trying to do now is he's out of office is what President Obama and Valerie Derrick tried to do with Bowe Bergdahl to whitewash somebody who betrayed a fundamental trust.</p><p>It just seems that this administration and those affiliated with it don't really have much respect for the genuine heroes but, boy, they've got time for the Bergdahl's and the Snowden's, and it really it's a disgrace but it's also just a sad, sad thing.</p><p>BOLTON: Let me ask you on a related matter how to do with tech companies, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft, that pledging to tackle online hate speech to combat the use of social media by terrorists.</p><p>But is this strong enough? I mean, can these companies make a difference? There are a lot of people who say that the tech companies have done a lot more to prevent other crimes, which is great, but for some reason there is this last wall in somehow protecting people who want to reach out and encourage others to do harm?</p><p>PETERS: Well, first these big tech companies, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft - they're not doing it out of patriotism, they're doing it because the European Union is basically forced them to and they're protecting market share.</p><p>Myself, I am, Deirdre, I would love to see true hate speech especially from Islamist terrorists removed from the web. The web is a great recruiting tool, and operational tool for terrorists and other bad guys.</p><p>But my concern is who gets to decide what's hate speech. For instance, if on this show I tell you that I believe, as I do, that extremist Islamist terrorists have to be killed, that they can't be reformed, well, in Germany, that might qualify as hate speech.</p><p>Does that mean that Google blocks Fox News insider? You know, it just who gets to decide? Thomas Payne incited violence, some of Jefferson's remarks could be banned. Now, again, I'm not arguing against banning Islamic hate speech, I'm just saying that the devil, like the Jihad is in the details.</p><p>BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters, thank you always for your insight.</p><p>PETERS: Love being on the show, Deirdre. It's a great show.</p><p>BOLTON: We love having you. Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a possible road rage incident caught on tape. A vehicle literally driving over a veteran's motorcycle. My next guest says he may actually have a legal defense.</p><p>Police, by the way, investigating the circumstances of the Ohio gorilla's death. Find out from a legal standpoint which party is reliable. The zoo or the boy's parents? Our legal eagles are going to weigh in next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THANE MAYNARD, CINCINNATI ZOO DIRECTOR: We did not take the shooting of Harambe lightly. But the child's life was in danger. And people who question that who are Monday morning quarterbacks, or second-guessers don't understand that you can't take a risk with a silver back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: The Cincinnati Zoo director is defending its decision to shoot and kill a 400-pound rare gorilla, after a four-year-old boy fell 15 feet into the enclosure on Saturday.</p><p>Meanwhile, animal rights activists are upset with the decision, they have created an online petition in memory of the gorilla. It calls for the child's parents to be investigated and held liable for negligence. The petition has gathered more than 100,000 signatures.</p><p>Attorneys Diana Aizman and Harleigh Tensen with me now. Welcome to you both. I'm glad you're here because that was frightening video for starters.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely.</p><p>BOLTON: And this is a really interesting case. So, again, just from a legal perspective, Diana, who is more liable, the zoo? The parents? Neither?</p><p>DIANA AIZMAN, ATTORBEY: So, at this point, it looks like the zoo did everything they were supposed to do as far as the barrier, how the barrier was set up. It was in line with the regulations that surround that.</p><p>And it seems that they made a decision that was aided by a team that made the assessment. They decided that they need to end the gorilla's life in order to save the life of the small child. So, it seems like they did what they were supposed to do.</p><p>BOLTON: Can, I'm just saying, rightly or wrongly, and I heard the director, for one thing he made the right call. That matters. But what about this animal rights activists are they able to bring a lawsuit against the zoo?</p><p>HARLEIGH TENSEN, ATTORNEY: They are not because they don't have standing. The zoo is property -- I'm sorry, the gorilla is property.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>TENSEN: So, loss of property.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Well, let me take care.</p><p>TENSEN: Exactly. And it's troubling and upsetting but they won't -- they do not have standing to sue.</p><p>BOLTON: So, what about these animal rights activists who are also petitioning that the parents basically be charged with negligence. Is that going to stand up?</p><p>AIZMAN: You know it's hard to say. At this point it's too early to put that kind of label on this. I think that it is appropriate for them to go in and investigate the situation, make a determination whether or not this was an isolated incident of negligence or if this was sort of a pattern of behavior where this mother is losing track of her child.</p><p>BOLTON: Because that happens essentially to all parents at some moment you lose track of your child.</p><p>AIZMAN: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: However, this enclosure looks pretty set up to keep people and animals apart.</p><p>TENSEN: Which is why I think it took more than three seconds for this boy to find a way through the enclosure and through the barricade. I understand you turn your head, accidents happen. But I think he really had to be searching around for a way to get into the enclosure.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>TENSEN: We're with the parent then.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Speaking of this topic, celebrity zoo keeper Jack Hanna is defending the Cincinnati Zoo's decision to kill the gorilla. He is going to be with me shortly to talk about it.</p><p>But I want to ask you to another legal question. Because look at this video, it's a hit-and-run in Florida, it shows the vehicle driving over a veteran's motorcycle in a suspected road rage incident.</p><p>So, the driver arrested on aggravated battery with a deadly weapon charge, driving without a valid driver's license. But is there anyway, I mean, when you look at this, it's horrifying. But does the driver is some lawyer going to take the case of the driver and argue successfully on his behalf?</p><p>TENSEN: Absolutely. I think they could. There is so much we don't know. Is the video horrifying? It is. But we don't know if there was a steering malfunction. We don't know if the driver was provoked.</p><p>BOLTON: We are assuming it's road rage, but that's a great point. That could be an assumption.</p><p>AIZMAN: OK. So you know what's really, really difficulty when you're a criminal defense attorney is when you have an actual videotape of your client committing a crime. That makes defending somebody incredible challenging.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. Because you see that and you're like, oh, my God.</p><p>AIZMAN: Yes. That mean it looks from what I'm watching, it looks like a guy behind the wheel who drove his vehicle on purpose over a motorcycle that had someone on it.</p><p>TENSEN: How can you say that was on purpose just based on the video? You can't say that that was on purpose. The intent isn't there based on the video alone</p><p>AIZMAN: Right. And if he kept driving forward, I'd say maybe there were some issue with his health or maybe he was having some sort of a medical episode and he lost track of the vehicle, but that doesn't appear to be what's happening here. He then drove off. He corrects the course and then drives off.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: So, but, Harleigh, I hear what you're saying, there's defense for anything. What if the motive -- I don't know. What if there was some road tension, meaning like the motorcycle is too close, who knows, was too close to the car, aggravating them. It still doesn't give the rights for the car driver to hit him on purpose.</p><p>TENSEN: Of course not.</p><p>BOLTON: Even if he provoked it.</p><p>TENSEN: Of course not. But we still don't know if it was intentional.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>TENSEN: He drove away, people get in accidents, they get scared, and they drive away. That doesn't mean he intentionally brand it.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Would you want to represent him?</p><p>TENSEN: I would absolutely represent him.</p><p>BOLTON: You would?</p><p>TENSEN: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Diana?</p><p>AIZMAN: I would represent him. Absolutely. I mean, everybody in this country is entitled to a fair criminal defense.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. There we go. Two pros legal eagles. Diana and Harleigh, thank you so much. Glad to have you.</p><p>TENSEN: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Major automakers racing to get the first driverless car to market. A new report says a rush will make them more hackable than ever. We're going to bring you details, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here we go, start moving, sending brake command. Stops.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here we go, starting our slow five-mile-an-hour cruise. Sending the command. And we brake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Driverless cars may provide more opportunity for hackers. Some are proving there are ways to control brakes, engines and other components remotely.</p><p>My next guest says that security risk isn't the only one. MIT tech reviews San Francisco bureau chief, Tom Simonite is with me now. Welcome, Tom. Why are driverless cars more of a security risk than human driven ones?</p><p>TOM SIMONITE, MIT TECH REVIEWS CHIEF: Hi, nice to be here. If you speak to anyone who works in security, they would tell you that adding more computers to something makes it more hackable. There are just more things that can go wrong.</p><p>When things are hooked up to the internet, of course that provides a way in for an attacker. And it's clear to make cars drive themselves, you need to add a lot of computers to these vehicles, you know, as well as all the equipment to control different components.</p><p>BOLTON: OK, but you're saying that in addition to those potential breaches, there are other issues. I know you're out in California, I assume you have visited some of the places that are testing these driverless cars. What are you seeing? What are you hearing?</p><p>SIMONITE: Yes, that's right. I mean, if you're here in the Bay Area, you just need to visit the right stretch of the 101 freeway and you can see Google's cars out and testing on public roads. This is a very exciting technology.</p><p>I think a lot of us are ready to give up driving and lean back and relax. There are a lot of safety benefits. Some of like 30,000 people die on U.S. roads every year, maybe we can cut that.</p><p>This is moving fast. You know, Google just announced that it's opening a new testing facility outside of Detroit where it work with Chrysler on some self-driving minivans and Toyota and some of the comment they say they want to have autonomous cars by 2020.</p><p>So, there's a lot of optimism in the industry but there are questions about how exactly we're going to get there to the state where you know, you and I can safely text in our car and not have to pay attention to where we're going.</p><p>BOLTON: So, when you speak with the experts, what are they telling you? What are their biggest challenges right now?</p><p>SIMONITE: So, the biggest challenges are around the complicated urban driving that we do which often involves a lot of thinking and so much like a social act. If you're in an urban environment, you might be making eye contact with other drivers. You might be in situations where a road is closed and there were cops standing out in the road telling you where you need to go.</p><p>Computers and, you know, robotic equipment is great when it comes to making quick reactions to, say, somebody is in front of the car, but computers aren't there with the commonsense that is needed to decode some of this difficult urban situations.</p><p>BOLTON: Right. So, human brain are still for the moment slightly stronger than machine ones, which is good to be sure of from time to time even though I know that humans are the ones programming all the artificial intelligence tools.</p><p>We take the point, nonetheless. Thank you, Tom.</p><p>SIMONITE: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Tom Simonite with me there from MIT tech review.</p><p>Well, Fox News is now confirming that conservative writer Bill Kristol is eyeing conservative lawyer Weekly Standard editor David French for an independent presidential run, third party, against <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>Kristol is part of the hash tag never Trump campaign, and he previously was pushing for Mitt Romney.</p><p>When we come back, animal rights activists are crying foul. They're holding a vigil for the slain gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo that was shot to protect the boy.</p><p>Celebrity zoo keeper Jack Hanna disagrees saying the caretaker's decision to save the boy's life was the right one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mommy's right here!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: A 4-year-old boy fell into a rare gorilla's enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo. The zoo's director made the decision to shoot the gorilla to save the child. Some animal activists disagree and are crying.</p><p>Columbus Zoo director and TV host, Jack Hanna says the zoo director made the right call. Jack, we are so glad to speak with you. Thanks for the time. As a director of a zoo also in Ohio, this hits super close to home. What is your take on the situation?</p><p>JACK HANNA, COLUMBUS ZOO DIRECTOR EMERITUS: Well, at the Columbus Zoo the first gorilla in the world that they were boarding here because we only have 20 gorillas boarding here to survive. The oldest living gorilla in the world lives here too.</p><p>So, you can see how we've worked with gorillas for over 30-something year. I have a home in Rwanda that which is only two miles from mountain gorillas since for the last 20 years. So, I'm not an expert in any means. But I can tell you this.</p><p>I've witnessed gorillas both in the zoo and the wild, I can tell you also when I first saw this on TV, when the child is there, all of a sudden he jerks the child, he goes through there, you heard the noise in my ear just now, but the people are screaming and stuff, you got a gorilla there silverback by the way.</p><p>They now had this human in there and all of a sudden they do the alarm call. All this family the women or the girl gorillas go in the building. He was out; he was there in the building something sit in the moat, people screaming.</p><p>All of a sudden he drags that child. That's a dead giveaway for me. And I always says this because I witnessed it in the wild. I witnessed it in the zoological parks. I'm telling you that child would not be here today if they waited.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Jack, you know obviously a lot more about these animals. Are saying by the fact that female gorillas went in, people were screaming, that the silverback his whole job is to protect his tribe so you're saying wuth that in mind he would have killed the child.</p><p>HANNA: Yes. I'm telling you that right now when he did that actually, now I saw that face on the animal that is a face you don't want to see and especially a silverback. Then a female maybe little sit on that situation.</p><p>But right now this animal is confused. He's upset. Now somebody would say, well, why don't you tranquilize the animal by the way. That's a whole different world, everybody. How about you getting in that moat there, let's say that kid starting fighting that gorilla after a few minutes. Everybody that want to wait.</p><p>You cannot wait in a situation like this. I have seen a gorilla -- a gorilla definitely like you saw there take a green coconut that you can't bust it with a hatchet and go like it and squeeze it.</p><p>What I'm saying is all you had to don't, it'd actually with like this start screaming fight again, what do you think he would have done that child. You don't want to watch...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: he would consider it an attack or a threat what you're saying here what he did.</p><p>HANNA: Of course. Yes. And you might know you have a human being in here. And by the way, everyone says how they love the gorillas. It's very simple. Why do they love the gorillas? Because they have seen them in zoos, they haven't seen them in the wild. You know, many people if you get to see a gorilla in the wild you can't count them probably, you know, it's a hard thing to do. It's very expensive thing to do.</p><p>I've been very blessed to be able to film these for 30-some years. And I'm just saying that you have human life and animal life. You know, we have something here which are not...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: I agree with your point.</p><p>HANNA: It's just a no-win situation for anybody.</p><p>BOLTON: Jack, we thank you so much. Thank you for sharing your insights.</p><p>HANNA: Thank you. All right.</p><p>BOLTON: Jack Hanna with me there. Thank you for joining us here on Risk &amp; Reward. Making Money with Charles Payne starts now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2016053101cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JX3-W651-JB20-G0R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7370\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

We really appreciate it. And thank you for having us in your homes. Thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right on the Fox Business Network. Have a good evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good evening, everybody. President Trump in London tonight but that means little to the national left-wing media. The radical Dimms or even his own communications department at the White House. The media focusing in on, well, inane stories with little purpose other than to embarrass the President. The Dimms summoning a Watergate figure to testify as part of their own approximation of a witch-hunt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The White House Communications Department playing some sort of games, we'll explore here tonight what they are. We take all that up tonight with Ed Rollins, Michael Goodwin, Tom Fitton, John Solomon among our guest. And big tech selling off today as the Justice Department prepares for anti- trust investigation into Google, sending concern throughout Silicon Valley.</p><p>We talk the up the latest from Wall Street, Moody's chief economist, John Lonski. And China and Mexico desperate now to talk trade with the Trump administration after the President has made it clear he will demand fair, reciprocal, responsible trading relationships with both countries. China trying to take shots at the President's America First agenda, yet saying they are willing to negotiate with the Trump administration. Now isn't that nice of them?</p><p>Mexican officials are already in Washington to talk about the President's proposed tariffs on Mexican goods so long as they don't fight illegal immigration and secure their half of the U.S.-Mexico border. The President not holding back about the years of Mexican abuses of the American immigration system.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They have to stop the illegal flow, the flow of drugs, of immigrants, illegal immigrants, people that have not gone through the process. And if the Democrats would wise up and give us the proper laws, the proper immigration laws, we could solve the problem in one day. What Mexico's been doing to this country for so many years, like 25 to 30 years worth of drugs and human trafficking and illegals all pouring through Mexico, no good. And caravans. No good.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Those among the last comments from the President before heading for London. We talk about the latest in the President's ballots over so-called free trade that has cost this country trillions of dollars and millions of jobs and the deadly drug trade across our border with Mexico. We begin tonight with the President's visit to the United Kingdom, there to establish a deeper trust with a longtime ally.</p><p>At home his communications department playing some rather peculiar games. We'll tell you about that. A number of administration officials appeared on major networks today including Ben Carson, Sonny Perdue, Kevin Hassett. We had booked White House National Trade Council President Peter Navarro here on the show but the White House tells us that they did not want to detract from the President's visit to the Buckingham Palace tonight.</p><p>And so they actually retracted Navarro from our guest list. And as the White House denies guests, it also allows the national left-wing media to focus on stories like the President's hair, the fake news that he a called Meghan Markle nasty without response from the White House. Those stories dominating the headlines overshadowing Judicial Watch's discovery of new e- mails between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.</p><p>Those e-mails showing special treat for Hillary Clinton's attorney during the FBI investigation of Clinton's e-mail server scandal. A lot to go through tonight, and joining us to kick it all up, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. Tom, great to have you here. Another revelation courtesy of Judicial Watch and the freedom of information system. Tell us what this means that her attorney was given special access, special treatment with -- by the FBI.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Yes. Her attorney, David Kendall, who represents her personally, was -- according to the new e-mails that were covered by a lawsuit, they weren't voluntarily disclosed by the Justice Department, these are Page-Strzok e-mails. The top lawyer for the FBI, James Baker is talking to David Kendall on how to get records to Hillary Clinton about the e-mail investigation.</p><p>And he tells Kendall -- advises Kendall file a FOIA request, file a privacy act request, Kendall according to e-mail traffic once quickly on behalf of Hillary Clinton, so this isn't like your dealing with Hillary Clinton, her 302 which is the narrative report created by the FBI of that sham interview she underwent. And sure enough, the e-mail showed a top lawyer at the FBI, rushed this through the process in order to get the 302 before the election.</p><p>DOBBS: To get the 302 the before the election and how irregular is this? Put this in some context for us.</p><p>FITTON: Well, I've been at Judicial Watch 21 years, we've never talked to general counsel of the FBI about any FOIA requests, nor have we ever received any such solicitation or help or facilitation for any freedom of information act request. This is extraordinary, special treatment for a presidential candidate, someone they presume is going to be president and recall at the same time they were breaking the law arguably to target her opposition then-candidate Trump.</p><p>DOBBS: And it goes on and on. There is without -- just what Judicial Watch has managed to deter your lawsuits through FOIA request, through the information that you have pride from the hands of the deep state and a reticent Federal government is remarkable. But we are not seeing -- we're not seeing any sign right now of prosecution. Where is the inspector general report?</p><p>Where -- it's been long promised and now we're in June, just for the record, and no prospect whatsoever as far as I can determine that we will see an inspector general report. Do you have new information for us?</p><p>FITTON: I don't. I hope the Inspector General report comes out, but he can't prosecute if anyone. The best he can do is refer questions for prosecution. We don't know what's going to happen there. We've learned from Attorney General Barr that the Special Counsel appointed by Jeff Sessions hasn't done much of anything at all and has deferred to independent -- or the Inspector General.</p><p>DOBBS: We're referring to John Huber, is that right?</p><p>FITTON: Yes. John Huber, the U.S. Attorney out in Utah. He's been AWOL on all these issues --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Can you explain that? I mean, have you got any idea what he's been doing all this time or what he --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON: Well, I mean, he was hired specifically by Jeff Sessions because there was pressure for a special counsel. Huber was the answer to that, and he was tasked with investigating whether to investigate. It's no surprise to me as a result nothing much has been done.</p><p>DOBBS: You -- it's a trite expression, so I won't use it but I have to say it's just stunning to see what the top officials of the Justice Department and the FBI have gotten away with. They have successfully, I believe, successfully run out the clock. I will be absolutely stunned, Tom, if indeed we see any kind of productive investigation of some of the people who are -- just based on the information that we see in the texts, all of them.</p><p>It looks as if they're all going -- including the people who have already been dismissed, looks like they're all going to go free without account.</p><p>FITTON: Well, Attorney General Barr needs to accelerate any investigations that are going on and move as quickly as possible. It's pretty clear he understands the corruption but needs to move the agency ahead --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: But the process becomes corruption itself, does it not, tom? When it takes years? I mean, I'm still waiting for the report on Benghazi, for crying out lord. One thing we've learned from the Justice Department over the years under the Obama administration is that the FBI and the Justice Department are where investigatory efforts go to kill truth. We have learned precious little as a result of their so-called investigatory powers and prowess.</p><p>FITTON: Well, you know, it's not remarkable, but -- it's remarkable and not to tout our own horn but Judicial Watch's work is the only way to get this information out right now. Congress is asleep at the switch or trying to suppress information by targeting Attorney General Barr with a fraudulent contempt move and without Judicial Watch, this material wouldn't be released. It's great for Judicial Watch, but distressing because the other agency --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. It makes me mad as hell that we have to rely, frankly, on Judicial Watch instead of our own elected officials and appointed officials of the Federal government. By the way, speaking of outrages, our Supreme Court is an outrage, denying an expedited hearing on the DACA executive order of President Obama and just for what reason? Why? Only millions of people are hanging in the balance here.</p><p>The entire American population, apparently, doesn't have any rights as citizens to understand what is going on with an executive order from a previous administration for whom it is -- I mean, it just goes on and on. This is maddening.</p><p>FITTON: This is an Obama amnesty granted to the children of illegal aliens, and it's an incentive for the current crisis and the courts have gotten in the way of the President's prerogatives to undo this illegal act by President Obama and that the Supreme Court refuses to rein in its lower courts is really shows that, again, the Justice -- I mean, the courts have been part of the swamp in this country for too long and the anti-Trump judiciary is a major factor in causing the immigration crisis that's now threatening our nation.</p><p>DOBBS: The Supreme Court itself is now becoming -- I mean, it's obviously part of the problem now. Because it's hearing how many cases a year, maybe 100 out of the thousands and thousands in the Federal system? It takes years and years to hear a Federal case, a civil case it takes years and years to watch a criminal case. This is an archaic anachronism, our Federal court system right now and it is pathetic and pitiful disservice to the American people and our ideas -- our once ideals of American justice.</p><p>Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch doing their best to make sure that that does not continue. We appreciate it, Tom, as always. Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON: You're welcome.</p><p>DOBBS: Still ahead, John Solomon joins us next with his latest report detailing the extent to which Hillary Clinton went to undermine the Trump presidency. Also a sign of how radical the Democratic Party really is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of the worst years for Democrats in a quarter century. I was --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: You know, when you tell some audiences that you not a socialist or that socialism is a really bad idea, that's the result, you know, that's the result. We'll be telling you why they're booing so many of those 2020 candidates -- well, at least one or two, right after these quick messages. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Leading Dimm radical and radical Dimm House Majority Whip James Clyburn says he and the rest of his delusion so-called party have already begun the process of impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: You think that the President will be impeached or at least proceedings will begin in the House at some point but just not right now?</p><p>REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): Yes, that's exactly what I feel. I think we've already begun it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: That is one of the doggondest questions I've ever heard a man has. Do you think that the point by possibility that it could happen at a point sometime future, blah, blah, blah, blah. I mean, and that asked for a question. Clyburn telling Fox tonight he hasn't heard from Nancy Pelosi about his comments. Apparently, he will. That's the implication there, isn't it? And the radical Dimms' disarray on full display over the weekend, particularly in California.</p><p>Just listen to what happened to former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney after they warned about socialism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HICKENLOOPER: If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big, progressive goals, socialism is not the answer. I was reelected --</p><p>JOHN DELANEY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Medicare for all may sound good but it's actually not good policy nor is it good politics. I'm telling you. I'm telling you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: You know, he could say he's telling them I guess three or four telling him. That mean that was emphatic boo fest right there. Joining us tonight former Reagan White House Political Director, Fox Business Political Analyst, the savant himself, Ed Rollins. New York Post Columnist, Pulitzer Prize winning columnist and Fox Business Contributor, Michael Goodwin. Great to have you both here.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: There's a lesson there, Michael, I think for those Democrats had better get on the socialism train, don't you think?</p><p>MICHAEL GOODWIN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I guess that was at the California State Party Convention, right?</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. You would have -- you would have expected something a little liberal I think.</p><p>GOODWIN: It is bizarre because if they really go down this road, I just don't see --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOODWIN: -- well, but I mean, guys like that, Hickenlooper and the other one trying --</p><p>DOBBS: The country is going to be poor for their nonparticipation.</p><p>GOODWIN: Yes. They're trying to stop the train but just they're ignoring all the, you know, yellow flags and just racing right to the doom, it seems to me.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it's -- what do you make of it, Ed? I mean, we are watching quite a --</p><p>ROLLINS: This is -- this is one of the hot shot (INAUDIBLE) governor of Colorado. They're been talking about -- talking about --</p><p>DOBBS: Hickenlooper is a hot shot governor?</p><p>ROLLINS: Among Democrats. They're been talking about him and he stood up there in front of an audience that basically -- that would frighten me to even go near the building of -- I mean, this got the most screaming left- wingers in the world. Basically said socialism isn't the answer, and they booed him for two minutes. I mean, for two minutes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you got make a point.</p><p>ROLLINS: And so if that's -- if that's where they are, you know, this is a state, obviously --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: What does -- what does it say for their candidacies, these two gentlemen, that they couldn't even read that audience well enough to know that you're not going to mess with socialism in 2019?</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, a Congressman from Maryland better get back on the -- get back on the ballot in Maryland because he's not going anywhere, they can boo him longer. And the Governor obviously may get reelected. I'm not sure. I'm not sure (INAUDIBLE) again. I think the bottom line is that there's too many candidates in this race that aren't going anywhere, and part of the problem is nobody pays the price anymore.</p><p>You can have 23 candidates and used to be that you had to have some substance, you'd move up, enhance yourself. Half these people couldn't move up the next step, let alone run for president.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, what do you make of James Clyburn talking about impeachment? He's pretty emphatic about the possibility of the ambiguity of the prospect about possibly doing something about impeachment. I mean, I love that Jake Tapper question. That's a beauty.</p><p>GOODWIN: Well, interestingly in that sequence of -- it's a Fox news story today, they have Clyburn saying that, that we have to educate the public. And then Jerry Nadler who runs judiciary says we also, the people don't know the facts and people don't understand yet. So you put these two together --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Nadler actually said we want to impeach, but the public's not ready.</p><p>GOODWIN: They don't understand the facts. They don't --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, apparently, neither does the conference. They're only -- what are the latest numbers? We're up to what? 50-something, Democrats who are ready to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: -- 54 House Democrats in The New York Times, 58 say they won't support it.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes.</p><p>GOODWIN: Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS: 54 or so, 58 and 23 don't want to answer.</p><p>DOBBS: There we go.</p><p>GOODWIN: But the idea that the public is too --</p><p>DOBBS: By the way, I don't know that that we should say the House calls for impeachment and put only 58 members are calling for impeachment. That's what's -- this is a joke, what's going on in the Democrat Party.</p><p>ROLLINS: And a bunch of them are not exactly calling for impeachment, what they're basically saying, they're waffling, they're saying , you know, we need to educate the public, we need to do all this and if it leads to an impeachment that would be for impeachment.</p><p>GOODWIN: But --</p><p>DOBBS: They have -- let's be honest, they haven't got the guts.</p><p>ROLLINS: They haven't got the guts.</p><p>GOODWIN: Well, by my point is the arrogance saying that if only the public knew what we know and if they understood the truth, they would -- they would vote for impeachment. I mean --</p><p>DOBBS: We call that the Schiff conundrum.</p><p>GOODWIN: Yes. They --</p><p>DOBBS: Just the rest of the world knew what he knew for two years but the evidence of which, the proof of which he could not produce on a million dollar bet.</p><p>ROLLINS: I'm waiting for the first charge to be put forward that says the President did something illegal.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Al Green will oblige you, but that's not going to amount much.</p><p>ROLLINS: There's no there there. It's just -- it's --</p><p>GOODWIN: It's going to be a tough vote for a lot of people to take when it comes to voting in this.</p><p>DOBBS: You know what's going to be really tough is to explain to the American people, the folks in California notwithstanding who were booing Hickenlooper and the -- and the Maryland Congressman, it's going to be tough to explain why they've been in power all this time, in 2020 running the Congress and the United States, and haven't done diddly. I mean, nothing. By the way, that's a very good Texas word, diddly if anybody wants to write it down.</p><p>GOODWIN: Squat, isn't it?</p><p>DOBBS: Squat is -- that's more of a -- that's more of a West Coast word. But a very hip West Coast word in its time. So let's turn to the -- to really where we are with the Republicans. Speaking of not doing much, what's the Senate been doing as we are watching, you know, what's his name, pencil neck as the President refers to him, Schiff. What is he doing? He's just running off at the mouth and still is in charge of the Intel Committee.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, it's astonishing to me, and the truth of the matter is, you know, they're not pushing the judges through anymore. Just there's a lot of confirmation hearings that should be being held and not -- and not doing anything. They say they're stopping all the stuff coming from the House. I don't know what's coming from the House, it's all garbage. So at this point in time, they could all go home and wait until November of 2020, the American public wouldn't miss them.</p><p>GOODWIN: Except for the judges and other confirmation. I mean --</p><p>DOBBS: Very quickly.</p><p>GOODWIN: They did confirm -- they did confirm Bill Barr's second number two in the Justice Department last week, I believe.</p><p>DOBBS: That was very good.</p><p>GOODWIN: I, look --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: -- and you're telling me what a powerhouse of performance they are.</p><p>GOODWIN: It's all they can do, they're doing what they can.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's speak about a true powerhouse, and that is the President's position on tariffs on Mexico and poor Lopez Obrador saying that, you know, America First is a fallacy. And this week he's decided maybe he could use those, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars that come from Norte.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, a spotlight goes on and all the jobs in Mexico got making American cars, they cannot w win that battle. The President's clearly won this battle, he's put pressure on them and I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, we better start -- by the way, Lopez Obrador, the populist president, so-called, Mexico has now decided that he can just tell the President what he's done so far to help him with illegal immigration. He doesn't really have to do anything. I mean, he actually said that, Michael. Absolutely, he misses the point.</p><p>GOODWIN: Somehow, the migrants have not gotten the memo because they keep coming in these record numbers.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. Just think what they'd be doing if the Mexican government --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOODWIN: Please don't help any more.</p><p>DOBBS: -- tough enforcement. Ed Rollins, Michael Goodwin --</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: -- thank you both, gentlemen.</p><p>ROLLINS: Great. Thanks.</p><p>DOBBS: The number of people taking the oath of U.S. citizenship has reached a five-year high despite howls from the radical Dimms and their associates in the left-wing national media, President Trump's immigration policies are producing more naturalized citizens than at any time before. Swearing in almost 757,000 people as new citizens in 2018. The trajectory is higher.</p><p>Up next, just how far the Clinton machine went to disrupt the Trump presidency, perhaps overthrow the government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, don't move.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Don't move. What made this man jump up off the ground? We'll have that and much, much more right after the break. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan reportedly met with CNN anchor Jake Tapper in an off-the-record meeting in late May. According to one report, an administration official said that McAleenan is quote, more concerned with ingratiating himself with other Never Trumpers who've always advocated for open borders. McAleenan appeared with Tapper this weekend on CNN's State of the Union.</p><p>A brand new report tonight from The Hill's John Solomon detailing the Clinton campaign's abuse of the Intelligence Community in an effort to stop President Trump from being elected to the White House. In that article Solomon says Clinton gained dozens of political IOU's from patrons who then donated to the Clinton Foundation. Solomon argues it's now time for the American public to call in their own IOUs on political transparency and to get some answers to 10 questions that he asked in his newest article on The Hill.</p><p>Award-winning investigative journalist John Solomon with us tonight. John, great to have you here.</p><p>JOHN SOLOMON, OPINION CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: This is one of the most frustrating questions I think that we any of us have faced and you in the lead journalistically in this story of Spygate is why, why is Hillary Clinton to this very day untouchable?</p><p>SOLOMON: It is remarkable, it's been 18 months since we learned that the Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the Steele dossier. So, we now learned that the FBI investigation, the key evidence was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign. And yet, not a single reporter has asked a question at any venue where Mrs. Clinton has appeared in the last 18 months. And her campaign has not responded in 18 months to the Senate Judiciary Committee's request for documents and answers. And the questions are, what did she know and when did she know it? Her campaign, her apparatus Christopher Steele launched an FBI investigation. Her campaign flooded the FBI with bad Intel and no one's ever asked her the questions.</p><p>DOBBS: And I think the essence of this outrage is contained in one paragraph certainly, and if I may share this with the audience, never before in history until 2016, if we could put that up. Had the apparatus of U.S. presidential candidate managed to sic the full weight of the FBI and U.S. intelligence community on his or her rival nominee during an election and by using a foreign Fed, uncorroborated, to be kind, political opposition research document. I mean, that is the essence of the political outrage and what we still don't know much about.</p><p>SOLOMON: This was a giant political dirty trick in the FBI and the CIA and other intelligence apparatus were used to carry it out. We now know 2-1/2 years later, there was no collusion but someone created the illusion of collusion for two years. The FBI in the lead and Mrs. Clinton's political opposition research team in the -- in the rear feeding it. It's absolutely remarkable that she hasn't been asked any questions. So, I posited 10 questions and hopefully the public will start to focus on what we need to get her to answer.</p><p>DOBBS: And I want to turn to your column on May 29th, because the president is in -- is in London.</p><p>SOLOMON: Sure.</p><p>DOBBS: And the question is always, you know, it's fundamental but it's even more proximate right now with the president there.</p><p>SOLOMON: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: And the headline is, did the Brits warned about Steele's credibility before Mueller's probe, your thoughts?</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes. So, we are now -- we've interviewed several witnesses and several members of Congress who have gained information just in the last few weeks at the British National Security Adviser rode the incoming Trump administration in January 17, long before Mueller was reported even before the first -- the second FISA was issued warning -- the Brits were warning them that they thought Christopher Steele had no credibility, was lacking in reliability, that his allegations weren't corroborated. It's extraordinary if that happened now. Everybody's looking for this letter, it's been lost or misplaced but there are witnesses who remember it and there's a search underway in Congress to locate it.</p><p>It would be an extraordinary document and it would raise a lot of questions, because if they warned the Trump administration as they were coming in 10 days before inauguration, they almost certainly would have also warned the Obama administration before these additional FISAs were sought. It's a remarkable time and I think President Trump has the opportunity while in Britain with Theresa May to perhaps get some answers about what the Brits know now.</p><p>DOBBS: Do we know to which of our chambers on Capitol Hill the letter was sent to whom?</p><p>SOLOMON: Yes, so the letter was sent from Sir Mark Lyall Grant then the National Security Advisor Great Britain to Mike Flynn the incoming National Security adviser to Donald Trump, and that's a remarkable in it of itself. Flynn, says to his lawyers he doesn't remember that letter but he was questioned about it by Bob Mueller during the briefings that occurred. So, even Bob Mueller's team knew the letter existed. What we're trying to do is locate that letter now and several members of Congress in the House and the Senate are in search of that letter tonight.</p><p>DOBBS: That letter, had Mike Flynn remembered it, could have changed history, could it not?</p><p>SOLOMON: It really could have. Imagined if we learned in January 2017 that Christopher Steele's reliability, credibility was being questioned not only within the FBI as we now know but by the for -- the government for whom he formerly worked, the British government.</p><p>Remember, he's a former MI6 agent that would have -- it almost certainly changed the course of history if it had become public at the time.</p><p>DOBBS: John, as always, good to have you here. Thanks so much.</p><p>SOLOMON: Thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS: John Solomon. Up next, new signs China's Huawei is under -- unrelenting pressure from the -- from the president's blacklist.</p><p>DOBBS: China's Huawei plans to sell its 51 percent stake in the undersea cable business. Huawei Marine Hengtong Optic-Electric will buy the state for an undisclosed price. That sale will keep critical undersea internet cables in Chinese hands. Huawei Marine recently built or upgraded 90 undersea fiber-optic cables. Get ready for this, that accounts for almost a fourth of all underwater cables in all the world.</p><p>Well, joining me now, Dr. Michael Pillsbury, director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, author, trade advisor to the Trump administration. Michael, great to have you here.</p><p>DR. MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR, SENATE CENTER FOR CHINESE STRATEGY: Hi, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: First the implications if we may of Chinese dominance and control of undersea cables.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, so much information flows to those cables, 90 percent far more than satellites that it allows Chinese espionage and eavesdropping just a chance of a lifetime. I think this is all part of the long term technology war that's going on. I don't think this divestiture, if you want to call it that, the sale by Huawei is going to work. The company they want to sell it to as you know, Lou is affiliated with the Chinese Navy.</p><p>So, Huawei is closer to the Army, it's just a shift from the Chinese army to the Chinese Navy. It does show how important dominating these fiber- optics cables is to Chinese espionage.</p><p>DOBBS: It also demonstrates how just raw the Chinese have become in expressing their contempt for the intelligence and the powerlessness of Western nations who would oppose their dominance, whether it be in satellite or undersea cables or whether it would be in 5G technology, you name it. They're coming right at the United States, at Europe, all of the developed nations of the West.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I agree, especially Europe. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was pretty tough in Berlin on Friday about the access to information they will lose if they go ahead with Huawei. I think we can expect something out of tomorrow's meeting with President Trump and Theresa May. And the British still think they cannot sell the core to Huawei, but just peripheral parts of 5G. I think that's not correct, I think the president is right.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, it's stunning that the British have themselves so twisted in conflicting knots here when it should be a straightforward proposition. A matter of national security, a matter of preserving the -- as the president and the Queen toasted, one of the world's most enduring special relationships between the U.K. and the United States. It seems to be going sideways now.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I think it began last month when the Italians signed up for the Belt and Road Initiative, that was my first Chinese success. But what Europe does tonight and tomorrow about the June 4th Tiananmen Massacre of 30 years ago will also be important. They're going to be meetings here in Washington, demonstrations in Hong Kong. We can't let this the 30-year anniversary go by in the past European human rights activists have done something about the Tiananmen anniversary. So, we'll see tomorrow what they do.</p><p>DOBBS: I will offer one opinion on that when the United States decoupled human rights and its commercial trade interest, it was a tragic mistake for this country and for indeed our allies as well.</p><p>Michael Pillsbury, as always, great to have you with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump in the U.K. tonight. He along with Queen Elizabeth II, reaffirming the special relationship between the United States and Britain. Edward Lawrence in London tonight and has the story.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lou, the Queen hosts about two state visits per year. Only three U.S. presidents hold this distinction with Queen Elizabeth. That's President Bush in 2003, President Obama in 2011 and now President Trump. And the Queen tonight toasted to the United States, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH II, QUEEN OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: While the world has changed, we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures. Nations working together to safeguard a hard-won peace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: For the White House, this is a chance to show the United Kingdom that the U.S. will stand with them through Brexit. In fact, the U.S. is negotiating with the U.K. for a trade deal while the White House hopes to announce that deal in the days after Brexit. And the president during his toasts referenced how the Queen of England helped during World War II as a mechanic helping some vehicles as the war was coming to an end. She's saying that the two countries have enduring bonds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: On behalf of all Americans, I offer a toast to the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations and to the long cherished and truly remarkable reign of Her Majesty the Queen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And tomorrow, the President will be meeting with some business leaders in a roundtable with British Prime Minister Theresa May. Then the two world leaders will have a joint news conference. A spokesman for the British government says the Prime Minister will talk to the President about climate change. The White House says that the president wants to talk about trade and the possible security risk that Huawei could be.</p><p>Now, we haven't seen any large protests here in the United Kingdom today. However, there are larger protests scheduled for tomorrow. We'll have to see what happens. Lou, back to you.</p><p>DOBBS: And thank you very much. Of course, that hasn't stopped the national left-wing media in this country from talking all about protests, a day of pomp and protest declared one headline. Ed Lawrence from London, thanks so much.</p><p>Body camera video capturing a Tennessee sheriff's deputy saving two people from a rattlesnake.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, don't move. There's a rattlesnake right next to you. Don't move.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go toward me. Go toward me. Come here. Don't run away. Come here. Don't run away. Come here. Go toward me. That's a rattlesnake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: This is in Columbia, Tennessee, south of Nashville. The deputy had been called to the scene after a complaint about the couple laying on a dirt road. Neither snake -- neither the snake nor the couple were injured. We do not have any idea what the couple were doing in the middle of the road. We do know what the rattlesnake was doing of course, but didn't do much harm after all.</p><p>Up next, the federal government threatening big tech with well, with maybe a big break up. We'll have that and much more right after this break. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us tonight John Lonski. He's Chief Economist, Managing Director at Moody's. And we've got a lot for you to sort through. Let's start with over 100 point fall and the Nasdaq. Big tech looks to be in big trouble because they have been too big, too powerful, and acting anti- competitively at least in the minds of some, but particularly the Trump Justice Department. What is going on and what do you expect to happen from here?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MOODY'S: Well, that creates a lot of uncertainty, doesn't it, for what big techs are going to be able to do in the future, the Tech Titans. I think it may adversely affect technology overall in a way. Let's not forget that a lot of these startups, money pours in on the expectation that the startup eventually gets sold to one of the tech Titans, and that's how you reap the big gains.</p><p>I don't think the weakness in this area is over. I'd like to add something though. If we take out big tech today, I think the overall market did pretty good. You know, these lower bond yields as an index of housing secretary share prices. That was up by more than one percent.</p><p>DOBBS: Right. The overall index is relatively modest, though, I think you would agree whether you know, it is the S&amp;P or whether it's the Dow. So we've got a lot -- certainly not as bad as the Nasdaq, not anywhere near as bad, but it's clearly a signal that Silicon Valley has got real, real trouble on its hands.</p><p>LONSKI: The game is changing thanks to Washington. You know, the regulator is taking a closer look at the possibility, anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>DOBBS: You know what's funny is the House Judiciary Committee tonight has launched its own investigation, antitrust investigation trying to piggyback on the backs of Donald Trump, the man they spend all of their time harassing and annoying. But meanwhile the Justice Department has taken jurisdiction, the FTC has taken jurisdiction. They're in charge and the House, I don't know what they think they're doing.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, you know, for the longest period of time, Congress has sort of been a lagging indicator of what's going on politically, and that is -- that's a big problem for this country. I think the fact that Congress doesn't want to go ahead and assert its powers when it comes through immigration.</p><p>DOBBS: Powers of what?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, I mean --</p><p>DOBBS: These people are so impotent, so bereft of any idea, any energy. To watch on Nadler, a Schiff, which one of these geniuses do you want setting policy for the United States? I thank you very much, John Lonski, but I don't want them near policy.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, you're not always going to have a Donald Trump in the presidency. And we had a problem again with Obama, with the EPA going ahead and making regulation.</p><p>DOBBS: I know all the problems with Obama, what's the problem with Donald Trump?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, you know, some of the markets aren't exactly happy with the fact that Trump out of the blue imposes these tariffs special in the case of Mexico.</p><p>DOBBS: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, which part of the market is -- which part of the market, John Lonski is so happy with the $5 trillion on economic growth that we have sacrificed through trade deficits and oh yes, let's take up the trillions of dollars that the Chinese have stolen from us in intellectual property and technology over the past 20 years. Which part of the market is so thrilled with all that because we need to line them up?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, you know, we're still -- you know, we're still up under both Obama and Trump. We haven't -- the markets still doing well. It's taking higher profitability is growing.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, just take it -- let's keep it very simple.</p><p>LONSKI: I don't think there's --</p><p>DOBBS: Keep it simple.</p><p>LONSKI: I think they see that there is --</p><p>DOBBS: Let's keep it simple. Take it from an election day 2016 to now and how much are the equity markets up.</p><p>LONSKI: Put it this way. I think there was some problem that the market has with the fact that these proposed tariffs on Mexico came out of blue to deal with an issue --</p><p>DOBBS: OK, well, let me ask you this. Which part of the market is upset about 70,000 opiate deaths from -- as a result of the fentanyl, the opioids in one form another being smuggled across that border, the $50 billion the cartels are taking home? Which part of the market is upset by the other $30 to $50 billion in remittances that are being shipped across, and not to mention all of the money they make -- the cartels are making from smuggling illegals across that border.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, you're saying it's OK. The equity market is not the final measure of all things.</p><p>DOBBS: I'm telling you that -- I think it's not a final measure but I think that we're not even looking at all the measures that are there. And those are the measures we need to look at because that's where the greatest devastation is occurring. John Lonski, great to see you my friend.</p><p>LONSKI: Same here.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks so much. Up next, new e-mail show special treatment of Hillary Clinton by the FBI. You knew that back in 2016. Wasn't that erased? And a great outcome. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Judicial Watch uncovering new Strzok-Page e-mails that show the FBI gave special treatment to Hillary Clinton's demands. Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch joining us to talk about Judicial Watch's significant findings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: This is extraordinary, special treatment for a presidential candidate, someone they presumed was going to be president, and recalled at the same they were breaking the law arguably to target her opposition then-Candidate Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And President Trump in London tomorrow will meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May. And later in the day, he'll be holding a joint press conference. That should be interesting. That's it for us tonight. We thank you for being with us tonight.</p><p>National security expert Christian Whiton, attorneys Harmeet Dhillon and Emily Compagno among our guest here tomorrow as -- you know, we're going to bring you right up to date on the latest on the deep state and the Radical DIMMs. A reminder to follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs. We thank you for joining us. See you tomorrow.

There is the scene. We are waiting for the President. He's speech comes just hours after that huge rally for Republican Senator <person><nameText>Dean Heller </nameText></person>where the President defended <person><nameText>Judge Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>and touted the strength of our economy and of course the stock market which is doing well again today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking of that market, we are looking at another record day on Wall Street, the Dow, S&amp;P, hitting all-time highs again today. It could be 101st record for the Dow since election day. And it's up another 83 points. The S&amp;P also up, look at the NASDAQ just slightly lower, but overall another strong day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And good afternoon, everybody, I'm Ashley Webster in for Trish Regan. And welcome, everyone, to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>And as we wait for the President to take that stage in Las Vegas, I want to get to our other top story, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>defending his Supreme Court pick <person><nameText>Judge Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>as he calls on the accuser to come forward with evidence so that we can learn more about the alleged sexual assault.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Christine Ford, the woman at the center of it the controversy says she is willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee but only under her terms. All for the latest on this, let's bring in our Edward Lawrence on Capitol Hill.</p><p>And Edward, where do we stand on the issue of Dr. Ford testifying? When and if is that -- when is that going to happen?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, yes. Ashley, all I can say there was 10:00 deadline today and Senator <person><nameText>Chuck Grassley </nameText></person>set to say if she is going to testify or not. That came and went. The negotiations are ongoing.</p><p>Now, Senator <person><nameText>Chuck Grassley </nameText></person>still talking to committee members at this hour. Also key players like Senator Susan Collins related to how they want to go forward with this. And Ford's attorney has then negotiating with the committee and she said Ford does wants to testify but under certain conditions.</p><p>First, she wants to make sure that no lawyers asking questions, only the members of the committee. And <person><nameText>Judge Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>can't be in the room. She also wants Kavanaugh to testify first.</p><p>The Senator <person><nameText>Chuck Grassley </nameText></person>has said that Kavanaugh testifying first is a non-starter. In fact, legal experts say that it is very unusual to have the accused testify before the accuser puts the accusations on -- under oath.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, AMERICAN LAWYER: That is the most absurd, anti-due process, anti-American concept. You testify without having been formally accused under oath?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And President Donald Trump venting his frustration on Twitter saying that this is political stunt by Senator Dianne Feinstein saying she held on to the letter to the very last minute to try and delay the Kavanaugh confirmation. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>adding that Democrats don't really want answers to this, they just want to delay this confirmation. Then he tweeted, \"If the attack was as bad as she said, charges would have been filed immediately with local law enforcement by her either or her loving parents.\"</p><p>The Democrats for their part or Republicans for their part are sticking with Kavanaugh as their candidate or nominee for the Supreme Court. Democrats saying that a full investigation needs to happen including testimony under oath.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS COONS (D), DELAWARE SENATOR: I do hope that she testifies but I deeply respect her hesitation, given the ways in which her life and her family's life have already been disrupted by attacks, by disrespect, by death threats.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And officially the meeting or a hearing on Monday has not been canceled. <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>has said that he wants to testify under oath to clear his name. Again he could testify Monday. We'll just have to see how the negotiations end up.</p><p>Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. Edward Lawrence, thank you so much, Edward.</p><p>And as we wait for the President I'm joined by assistant editor for \"Wall Street Journal\" Editorial Page, James Freeman and American Majority CEO, Ned Ryun.</p><p>Ned, let me begin with you. I was looking at your notes on this. You said, we really have devolved into the theater of the absurd here. What part of this is the most absurd in your opinion?</p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO: Where to start. I mean, honestly, Dr. Ford and her lawyers have been given every opportunity to bring forward her accusations. Even, Ashley they offered to send staff out to California to have an interview with her.</p><p>And I think it's time we probably hit a stop button on this. We got to the point, now Democrats seem to think that the FBI is their personal investigation arm. And I know they got that impression when Comey was the head of the FBI but that's not how it works. The FBI does not have jurisdiction. Kavanaugh has already been through six background checks.</p><p>Ashley, I've been through a background check by the FBI for top security clearance at the Pentagon. They are extremely thorough. They go anywhere and everywhere and they dig into everything and then they ripple out start asking as many people as possible.</p><p>I have to tell you if you've been through six background checks by the FBI, somewhere, someone at some time would have said something about this and not one peep until now. And the second thing, as Edward was just saying this is utterly absurd and flipped everything, including common sense on its head to say Kavanaugh has to actually testify first before his accuser. That's insane.</p><p>And, I have to tell you, for this lawyer to try and put up list of demands and hold the Senate hostage with her demands is insane. And I think what <person><nameText>Chuck Grassley </nameText></person>and Republicans need to do is say, \"We gave you 10:00 a.m. deadline.\"</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>RYUN: \"We are going to continue with our meeting -- the hearing on Monday and if you don't show up that's fine. We will have a vote and move forward with the people's business.\"</p><p>WEBSTER: James, is the judge being treated fairly here?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think so. I mean, quite an odd spectacle.</p><p>WEBSTER: I'm sorry to interrupt. Let me follow that up, a lot of leading Democrats in my mind have already convicted him. Comments likes he committed --</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- attempted rape but GOP happy to put him on the court. You can't say that thing. The guy -- it's all alleged. Where does he get his reputation back? It's the question.</p><p>FREEMAN: He has been slammed in the media absolutely. And we should point out it's not just the President tweeting bout the way this was handled by Senator Feinstein, sitting on --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- the accusation for months, not including it in more than 1000 questions that went to Judge Kavanaugh, not mentioning it during the lengthy hearings on his nomination. This is also caused a lot of what we might call the liberal media to criticize him as well. Senator Feinstein's hometown paper in San Francisco, the chronicle.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: A lot of commentary in the \"Los Angeles Times,\" \"The New York Times.\" So this strategy of delaying and then springing this information has really not served anyone. I think Chairman Grassley and the Judiciary Committee made a reasonable response to say, \"OK. We will reopen this process, even though Senator Feinstein you sat on the information for so long. We're going to have a hearing Monday.\"</p><p>Finally the professor has a chance to tell this story and, this spectacle - -</p><p>WEBSTER: But under what conditions, you know. You know, how can the accused to go first when he doesn't really understand what the exact accusations are? He should be responding to them.</p><p>FREEMAN: And why are her lawyers trying so hard to delay the moment when she can share what she knows?</p><p>WEBSTER: Right. Right. I don't know.</p><p>FREEMAN: It's beyond bizarre.</p><p>WEBSTER: You know, Ned, will we ever get to the bottom of these allegations? I mean, based on the timeline, --</p><p>RYUN: No, I don't think so.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- the recollections of Dr. Ford?</p><p>RYUN: No, i don't think so. I think that's what so pernicious about this is I think it will come down to he said/she said. You know right now there are no corroborating witnesses to what happened over 35 years ago. There's a lot of gaps, there's a lot of inconsistencies. And this really is a vicious smear.</p><p>I go back to what Chuck Schumer said before this confirmation really begin, \"We will do anything, basically anything and everything to stop this confirmation from happening.\" Well, they've clearly shown that any shred of decency they have left they decided to go away with that and go after and smear him, what I think a very vicious smear.</p><p>But Ashley, you said something that I think is very important. In this country, we have always operated in our legal system but even in society with the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>RYUN: And now we have this Orwellian view of, you're guilty until you can prove yourself innocent.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>RYUN: This is a very vague accusation with a lot of details missing. And now people are saying, \"Well, Kavanaugh is guilty.\" How on earth do we even know what happened?</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>RYUN: And the sad part is, I don't know if we're ever going to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>WEBSTER: And that's my question. I don't think we can.</p><p>And James, what about GOP, some the Republican senators that may end up opting out of voting for <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh? </nameText></person>The Bob Corker, who else, we have Jeff Flake, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, they may just opt not to vote for him?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, that's possible. But I think given that Chairman Grassley has given this hearing, this opportunity for the professor to say her peace.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't understand what the argument would be, unless, the result of Monday and I think it should go forward Monday, unless that result is that she raises issues that the judge doesn't have an answer for. Other than that, if we're at the same place where it's a accusation -- WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- but no additional detail, no further evidence, I don't know what their argument would be. And I think the reason this is getting delayed so much is the people who really don't want to vote on this nomination --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- are Democrats running in Trump states.</p><p>WEBSTER: That's right. And that's why they're delaying it.</p><p>Ned, very quickly, didn't Anita Hill at least have the FBI investigate Clarence Thomas? And you know, I wouldn't say it was a huge investigation but they were brought in for a small portion of that investigation. Could we not do that here?</p><p>RYU&amp;N: They were, again, I don't know if we're really dealing with honest brokers on the other side, Ashley. If we say this, and it's delayed even more days. And then maybe something else will come up. I'm sorry at the end of the day, again I'm highly skeptical of all of this. This really smells to me like the left has a stall delay tactic to try and push this back until, maybe, potentially past the midterms.</p><p>And so, what this is really all about, Ashley, the left is terrified of losing the Supreme Court, the balance of it to an originalist like Kavanaugh and taking away their favorite tool for expanding their administrative state. That is what this is all about.</p><p>WEBSTER: I mean, can they push ahead and go with this, the Senate Judiciary just go ahead and vote and then get it to the full Senate?</p><p>RYUN: Sure. And you know, you don't need to disbelief the professor to also think that it's unreasonable with so little evidence to --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>RYUN: -- end his career and this nomination. And to think, regardless of what happened, the process was abused by Democrats here. There is a, way for the Senate to evaluate nominees. They didn't follow it.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. I have to leave it right there. As you can see this is a North Las Wegas V.A. medical Center. That's <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>moving to the podium. He's going to be signing a bill, more money for the Veterans Affairs Department.</p><p>Let's listen here.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, thank you very much. Please. It's great to be with you. And thank you to Secretary Wilkie, who is doing an incredible job, I have to say. And also to the great leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Some of those great leaders are with us today.</p><p>Today, I'm honored to be at the North Las Vegas V.A. Medical Center to sign into law a historic government funding bill that will renovate our nation's military bases and provide great world-class care to our great veterans. Unless you don't want it. Unless you don't want it.</p><p>I want to thank your state's great senator, <person><nameText>Dean Heller. </nameText></person>He has been so helpful. Dean has really been helpful. He's worked all the way, right from the beginning. And this was very important for him. But for working so hard to get the bill passed and get it put right on my desk, and to pass the groundbreaking V.A. reform. There's never been reform like we've been able to do over the last very short period of time.</p><p>Thank you, as well, to Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval for being such a strong advocate for Nevada's veterans. We're also -- thank you, Brian. Thank you, Brian.</p><p>We're also very grateful to be joined by Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Thank you, Adam. Great job. Hear he's doing well.</p><p>To every veteran here today, we are eternally grateful for your noble service to our nation. I would like to ask all of the veterans with us now to, please, proudly stand. That's great. That's great.</p><p>You're fantastic people. You're really fantastic people. Please. Thank you. You really are.</p><p>And we're fighting to make sure that you get the care that you so richly earned. And today's legislation is one more promise that the Trump administration is keeping. And we've done a lot of promises, and we've kept them all. And this is another one for the veterans.</p><p>With this funding bill, we've increased the VA's budget to the largest ever. We are delivering the resources needed to fully implement crucial V.A. reforms that, as you know, we've gotten. You know the reforms. We're going to go over them in a minute, but they are some reforms. And to deliver for our great veterans, just the way I said I would constantly on the campaign trail.</p><p>You backed me, and I back you. That's the way it works, right? That's the way it's supposed to work in life.</p><p>And with our booming economy, which is now, I think we can easily say, the greatest economy maybe we've ever had in our country. Stock markets yesterday, and I believe they're up today, so that means today. But the stock markets yesterday hit the highest they've ever been in the history of our country. And we've broken the record, now, over 100 times. So we keep breaking it, breaking it.</p><p>And actually, we have a long way to go. There's tremendous potential.</p><p>So with our booming economy, I'm also proud to report that the veteran's unemployment recently achieved its lowest level in more than 20 years. That means a lot of jobs. A lot of jobs are taking place.</p><p>Last year, I also signed into law the landmark V.A. Accountability Act. You know all about that. And that was something that was very important to me. Because you couldn't do anything, you couldn't -- if somebody was bad. You got a lot of great people, but you have some bad ones. You couldn't do anything. Now you can do it.</p><p>So I want to thank the dedicated Veterans Affairs doctors, nurses, and staff members who join us. Now, we're finally rewarding the many great people at the VA, while also ensuring that those who mistreat our veterans, we had people that really mistreated our veterans, they are now being held accountable. That's why it's called the V.A. Accountability Act. And they are being held, seriously, accountable.</p><p>Right, Mr. Secretary? He's had a lot of fun. He's had a lot of fun.</p><p>We take care of our good ones, and the others are held accountable. Right? And there was no way you could hold them accountable. They could be sadists. You had some of them, too. It doesn't sound nice.</p><p>They could be thieves. They could rob you blind. They could steal money, and you couldn't do anything about it. Now you can do whatever you want. Now you do what's right.</p><p>And you have a Secretary that's doing what's right. He's tough and he's smart. It's true.</p><p>And I can tell you -- this is always a good sign, General Mattis was not happy when I took him out of the Department of Defense. You know, we were going to have him for a short while. And then we said, \"You know, he's doing so good, we're going to keep him here.\" He wasn't happy, and that's usually a good sign. Isn't it, Governor? When they're not -- if they're happy, that's not a good sign. He wasn't happy. He's still not happy. But that's all right. But you're happy, right?</p><p>In a few months -- and a few months ago, I was very proud to sign into law another tremendous victory for our veterans. Maybe this is the one that we kept talking about and talking about -- 48 years. They couldn't get it approved. It made so much sense. I used to talk about it because I thought I was this great guy that had this great vision. It's called \"V.A. Choice.\"</p><p>And I said, \"You know, if you have lines where you can't see a doctor for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, twelve days, eight days, how about one day? No good.\" I said, \"I have an idea. Send them out to a private doctor. We got great doctors, and they'll be taken care of immediately. We'll pay the bill.\" I thought it was like this great idea.</p><p>Well, they thought about it for 40 years. They couldn't get it passed. We got it passed. So we have, now, V.A. Choice. So, now, if a veteran can't get the care they need from the V.A. in a timely fashion, they have the right to go see a private doctor.</p><p>Today, for the first time in American history, I am about to sign a bill that will fully and permanently give our great and cherished veterans choice, so you don't have to wait on line for 18 days to take care of a simple -- I mean, we had people waiting on line with a simple problem that, by the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. No more of that. If you have a line, you go see a doctor. You get yourself taken care of. We take care of it.</p><p>OK? Good. It was amazing. It was amazing.</p><p>You would think that would have been easy to pass. Well, there's a reason it took so many years; it wasn't easy. You have different groups and different people. But in the end, we all came together and we got it done. V.A. Choice.</p><p>Here with us today is Vin Putignano, a Vietnam veteran who is a great guy, who lives in Las Vegas. And, now, through the Choice program, he can see the specialist doctors that he needs while still getting his primary care through the V.A. medical centers like this one.</p><p>And that's the other thing, there's so many great things that they do that people don't recognize. And you don't have to go out all the time to get what you need, because so much of it is taking place here. We have some tremendously talented people.</p><p>I always hear about the incredible level of treatment and talent that the doctors have. You have really incredible doctors and nurses. You had to get to them; that was the problem. But you have some tremendously talented people.</p><p>So, Vin, I'd like you, if you would, to say a few words about V.A. Choice, please. Thank you, Vin.</p><p>VIN PUTIGNANO, VETERAN: First of all, good morning. Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words. I wish my mom was here. Because she wouldn't believe you.</p><p>Anyway, it's an honor to stand with you --</p><p>WEBSTER: As you were watching, this is from a V.A. Medical facility in North Las Vegas, the President just wrapping up talking about signing an appropriations bill and really highlighting the ability for Veterans to have Choice. If they can't get speedy medical care, they can now go to a private doctor. It will be covered by the V.A. He said earlier the President, listen, \"You back me on the campaign so I now back you. I made a lot of promises that I would help veterans and especially, the health care.\" He said, \"I'm making good on those promises.\" And he says, \"Look,\" he also by the way had took time to tout the markets which again are higher today.</p><p>He talked about how the economy is booming. And he also talked about V.A. unemployment being at the lowest level in more than 20 years. But the basis for what the President is doing today is helping veterans and the no Choice aspect of health care, a very important one. It's been a big one for a long time.</p><p>And the President believes that giving Veterans the ability to not only speed up the process within the Veterans Affairs but also allow veterans to go to private doctors if they can't get their care they need in timely manner. That is very important.</p><p>We're hearing the testimony of one particular vet who lives in Vegas with the President standing on there. Of course, we'll go back if the President makes some more comments.</p><p>But I still have our guests with us, James and Ned are still with me. Also by the way joining is Fox News Contributor Jehmu Greene.</p><p>Jehmu, I'm not going to ask you about Veterans affairs. What I do want to ask you about prior to listening to the President in Vegas, they were talking about the ongoing turmoil surrounding the nomination of U.S. Supreme Court nominee <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh.</nameText></person></p><p>Both Ned and James said, \"Wait a minute, there's a point here where it's getting ridiculous.\" I read your notes. You say it's getting ridiculous. But for all the other reasons, you believe that the accuser should be heard and the Republicans are ignoring the allegations being made.</p><p>JEHMU GREENE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. From the beginning of this nomination there has been a rush to just ram this nomination through. When you look at the hundreds of thousands of documents that Democratic members of the Senate were asking for, that they were denied, but as it relates to this accusation, what is the rush?</p><p>And I do find it odd that the 11 Republican men who are on that judiciary committee and unfortunately for the Republicans, they don't have one woman on the judiciary committee? That blows my mind. But for these 11 men, they have not learned anything since we lived through the Anita hill hearings.</p><p>And if we could take one step, one step back or even just a pause, take a breath, and understand how hard it is for someone to come forward with allegations like this. How hard it is for someone to basically say, \"I'm going to blow up my entire life to tell a story about something that happened to me that was very traumatic.\" There just does not seem to be much empathy and way too much partisanship when we should be getting to a place of human decency around these allegations.</p><p>And to come up with due process, why are they running away from due process? Why are they running away from the FBI investigating this?</p><p>WEBSTER: Well every -- so in that, let me bring in Ned.</p><p>GREENE: In the same way --</p><p>WEBSTER: Let me bring in Ned, let me bring in Ned very quickly because --</p><p>GREENE: -- as they did with the Anita Hill accusation.</p><p>WEBSTER: But Jehmu, let me just bring in Ned on that point because he says, \"Wait a minute, it's the left that has abandoned due process,\" right?</p><p>RYUN: They really have. And Dr. Ford is being given every opportunity to come forward and lay forth her accusations in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And, I can't, Ashley, <person><nameText>Chuck Grassley </nameText></person>has bent over backwards to offer her every opportunity.</p><p>GREENE: Absolutely not.</p><p>RYUN: And she -- and now we're back -- oh absolutely has. And now we're in this back in forth of a list of demands. I'm sorry, I think the thing that's going to be shameful when this all said and done, if this doesn't turn out to have any veracity, Ashley, then the Democrats would stoop to this level to use this. I think is pernicious because it then removes legitimacy from future allegations.</p><p>And we all know, we can all agree. There are men and women who have abused others sexually. This is a serious problem but to use this as a tool to beat somebody over the head for political gain. If this turns out to be just a political gambit, this is disgusting.</p><p>WEBSTER: James, I don't think the Republicans can be accused of trying to ram this through?</p><p>FREEMAN: No, they followed the process. The -- and by the way these are the duly-elected representatives of the people of this country.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: The voters chose these senators. They are doing the job. Voters gave them the Constitution gives them. The idea that because they're not a gender that this or that media observer wants but there is somehow not legitimate I think is, is way off target. But the process is what the Constitution gives them. It's their job. It's not the job of the FBI to make a judgment on whether someone is credible. That is the job of the United State Senate and that's what they're doing.</p><p>WEBSTER: Last point to you, Jehmu, let me just say this, one point that's being made by Dr. Ford is that she wants Mr. Kavanaugh to go first. But how can he answer those accusations when he doesn't really know what they are in detail? It seems back to front to me.</p><p>GREENE: Look, I don't think necessarily think Kavanaugh going first --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>GREENE: -- to something that her attorneys should stick to. But we have to keep in mind that Republicans, 30 years ago, Orrin Hatch was saying the exact opposite of what he is saying now and what your fellow guests just said. He was calling for the FBI to do an investigation. So what is different now?</p><p>FREEMAN: No, what's different is that --</p><p>GREENE: What is different is --</p><p>FREEMAN: -- it was not a public allegations at that point.</p><p>GREENE: -- that they have been trying to ram this through, from the very beginning. And all of the evidence is aligned to that.</p><p>WEBSTER: James --</p><p>GREENE: And certainly, there's been no bending over backwards. There's been a show up on this one day.</p><p>WEBSTER: Absolutely has.</p><p>GREENE: A week after this happened. And that's the only opportunity you get.</p><p>WEBSTER: Well they gave a deadline, today, Jehmu.</p><p>GREENE: That's a one chance.</p><p>WEBSTER: And that deadline apparently is come and gone. They are trying to get this thing resolved. Trying to handle it in a timely manner and it's dragging on.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think it also should be pointed out that Clarence Thomas - -</p><p>GREENE: That it's a lifetime -- it's a lifetime appointment?</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Clarence Thomas was confirmed --</p><p>GREENE: And so yes, this is coming.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- with a lifetime appointment because the American people decided. He was unfairly accused. They saw holes in Anita Hill's story. And that put the political pressure, and it's why both parties, members of both parties voted to confirm him.</p><p>WEBSTER: We have leave it there, everyone.</p><p>GREENE: And --</p><p>WEBSTER: We could go for the rest of the day and through the weekend. With James, Ned, Jehmu. Thank you for being here to discuss it. Obviously more to come, thank you very much.</p><p>Now this, internal e-mails suggests that some Google employees wanted to alter the search functions to counter <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>travel ban. Is this more evidence the Silicon Valley is fighting conservative voices. The intel is coming up on that.</p><p>Plus markets in record territory again today, how long can the bull run last? Years, so far. We'll ask the experts, next.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: The Dow and S&amp;P continuing their run into record territory today as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>touts the best U.S. economy ever.</p><p>Joining me now Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski and from Vision 4 Funds Distributors, Heather Zumarraga. Thank you both for being here.</p><p>John, let me begin with you, the question is always been how long can this Bull Run go? I've had a number of analysts say recently we're in about the seventh inning, would you agree with that? And I'm not sure that's --</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST: I don't know what that means, the seventh inning.</p><p>WEBSTER: No.</p><p>LONSKI: But as long as --</p><p>WEBSTER: Which they would suggest there we're 2/3 of the way through it.</p><p>LONSKI: As long as profits grow.</p><p>WEBSTER: I guess.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes, as long as you have a positive of outlook for profits --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: -- equally prices climb higher. And I don't think that this rally is going to be derailed over an extended period of time by higher interest rates. That's very important.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right. . LONSKI: I think right now that's still the biggest danger. But I think that danger is going to remain well contained as long as we had inflation expectations stuck forever at two percent.</p><p>WEBSTER: But I don't know if that's possible. But, you know, Heather what do you say? We in the seventh inning we still juts in the fourth inning, I don't know if you like this baseball analogies but what do you think?</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, VISION 4 FUNDS DISTRIBUTOR VP: Sure well, we'll be in the first inning if we get some of this trade disputes resolved between NAFTA, and China, and the U.S. as well. And seems like the markets are getting used to trade tensions also and the Federal Reserve has set to hike rates next week. Despite all of this the markets are still setting new records.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is saying that the U.S. economy is booming. So perhaps if we get some of the trade disputes resolved, maybe we're in the first inning.</p><p>WEBSTER: Well that wouldn't that be something?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER: John, what about that? The trade tensions are really been shrugged off by these markets. If in fact we do get deals with, you know, with Mexico, Canada, the biggie China if we can get that all done, are we open up a leg or two?</p><p>LONSKI: Yes, the market could care less about the schedule implementation of tariffs with China. They start next week --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: -- $200 million of goods --</p><p>WEBSTER: But then --</p><p>LONSKI: -- a 10 percent tariff, does someone who cares, you know? I mean, companies --</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: But that's a lot.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, it is a lot.</p><p>LONSKI: Companies -- yes, their profit margins is a lot to suck it in a little bit or they're going to find all --</p><p>WEBSTER: But, we, the consumers end up in with --</p><p>LONSKI: I think it well. I -- can the consumer afford to pay much more?</p><p>WEBSTER: That makes sense.</p><p>LONSKI: So you know, we had problems are now with auto sales and with home sales because both autos and housing tend to be overpriced at least from the viewpoint of the consumer.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: When the Fed talks about well contained inflation expectations what the Fed is telling you is the consumer is not an idiot. If companies try to rise -- raise prices by much more than two percent or three percent --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: -- what does the consumer do? They just don't buy.</p><p>WEBSTER: You know that's great, and that's a great point.</p><p>LONSKI: Disciplining.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, go ahead Heather.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Look at Walmart.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Walmart customers may endure higher prices. Assume Walmart CEO saying that they may have to hike prices on goods from food and beverage down to bicycles and consumer electronics. So across the board but the flip side of that, is Goldman Sachs actually said that the impact of tariffs on rising prices that the threat of inflation just from tariffs alone was only 0.3 of one percent expected. So you know it's a tug-of-war.</p><p>You have Walmart saying prices are going to go up. You have Goldman Sachs saying yes they are going to go up but not that much. So will it really have a big impact on consumers in spending this holiday season?</p><p>WEBSTER: And getting back to the markets, John, what could really knock this off? For one point they were saying whether the Fed gets over enthusiastic and starts raising rates too quickly? That doesn't seem to be the case? I mean what conceivably, is it just over when it's over?</p><p>LONSKI: I think it's the only thing that would knock this market down is suddenly when we find out that we grossly overestimated earnings growth. And that in fact, we begin to become nervous about a possible contraction of earnings. I don't see that happening anytime soon. Ultimately it's the growth of profits that determine the return from equities.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: And profits are expected to grow, not only this year not only next year, but into, what, 2020. According to the consensus, they have operating income, S&amp;P 500 up by 10 percent in 2020.</p><p>But one warning, there are growing number of economists that talk about a possible recession but you can't have a recession without a shrinkage of profit.</p><p>WEBSTER: You're right. You know what, Heather, and Charles Payne said this earlier today. He said this is the most hated bull run in history. No one likes it. It's been going on since 2009.</p><p>He says he loves that. And, you know, which speaks to maybe there's still a lot of money on the sideline that could come in.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes, markets climb a wall of worry. So the fact that there is -- are still people on the sidelines waiting for this pullback that just never happens is the reason why markets keep going higher.</p><p>I think people are on the sidelines saying, oh we're missing out despite trade tensions and rising interest rates. And that's why we keep heading higher along with strong U.S. growth. And around emerging markets doing very well this week also because the dollar is weakening so that's helping them.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right, so that could be the seventh inning. It could the first inning. It doesn't matter we're still in the game as they say.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER: Heather and John, we're already out of time, but thank you so much. I appreciate your time today.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Let's take a look at shares of Google if we can. There's a story out there about Google today, not particularly flattering. The stock off one percent down and a more than 12 bucks of 1,179, that's alphabetical as the parent company of Google.</p><p>A report today shows that some Google employees proposed altering search functions to counter <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>travel ban back when that happened. It didn't actually happen. That didn't the -- it wasn't put in place but is it more evidence that big tech is biased against conservatives. That's the question. We're on it next.</p><p>WEBSTER: Internal e-mails from Google show some employees wanted to alter the search results to counter <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>travel ban. Now, according to a \"Wall Street Journal\" report those suggestions never put in place, but it does prompt questions across about political manipulation and stifling of conservative ideas.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn has been following this story from Los Angeles.</p><p>And Hillary, what more is Google saying about this report?</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, hello, Ashley.</p><p>They're saying that they aren't taking any action against any of the employees that were involved in this explosive e-mail chain that shows employees of Google were plotting ways to fight back against the President's travel ban when it was announced by trying to control what users would see when they Google about the topic, in the e-mail chain, first obtained by Fox News', Tucker Carlson tonight, Search Product Market Manager Mackenzie Thomas lays out ideas and suggest terms that they should change, saying they should, \"Actively counter prejudiced terms like the words Mexico, Hispanic, and Latino and actively counter Islamophobic terms like Islam, Muslim and Iran.\"</p><p>Thomas writing to a group of Google employees saying, \"I know this would require a full on sprint to make happen, but I think this is the sort of super timely and imperative information that we need as we know that this country and Google, would not exist without immigration.\"</p><p>Now Google is framing the e-mail chain as just a brainstorm session among junior level employees. But Google's, Meryl Stone, now the head Consumer Partnership at Google was on that chain.</p><p>Also Google's Global Public Policy Manager, Clement wolf, chimed in on the chain asking how partisan should Google be on this issue? Writing, \"To the extent of my knowledge we've been breaching precedent if we only gave highlights access to organizations that support a certain view of the world in a time of political conflict. Is that accurate? If so we would be willing to open access to highlights to NGOs that actually support the ban?\"</p><p>Google gives me the statement in response saying that, \"These e-mails were just a brainstorm of ideas, none of which were ever implemented. Our processes and policies would not have allowed for any manipulation of search results to promote political ideologies.\"</p><p>And Ashley, they're telling me that they're taking no action against any of these employees. And no internal memo went out to the company, explaining that this is against company policy.</p><p>Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: Very interesting, Hillary Vaughn, good stuff. Thank you, Hillary, appreciate it.</p><p>Well, it certainly doesn't speak well does it to accusations of big tech is biased against conservatives. Here with more reaction, Scott Martin CIO of Kingsview Asset Management.</p><p>You know, Scott, OK, so we hear back from just a brainstorming, you know, session never went into effect. But it's certainly leaves the very bitter taste when you start thinking about the way that these e-mails were and worded was -- it's almost like it's us against them.</p><p>We've got to make sure, we've got to rush to get this in so that we can combat the policies of the Trump administration. To me it is very damning.</p><p>SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO: Yes. It's damning and damn them. Ashley, you know, thank you Google for doing this great service for the country, and trying to tell us how to think, right?</p><p>I mean what's interesting too though, you know, they're not really good I guess at burying searches, because if you Google internal e-mails, if you Google search that, you find a litany of stories now about how they tried to hide this stuff. So, hey Google take a clue and maybe bury while you're right (ph).</p><p>Here's the thing though, Ashley, like you and Hillary talked about, there was very little leadership in this department, right. I mean yes, I get it some underlings, some lower level employee's maybe spouting off and blowing off about Trump and the policies and what not fine. But the fact that you would have management on here kind of saying, \"Well, should we break protocol and not doing this or do this?\" Just goes to show you they really didn't care and maybe actually even thought about doing it.</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, and then of course, this comes on the heels, and I don't know Scott if you seen the video of Google executives seen that in that period of time just after Donald Trump became President, and the role sitting around having this kind of session talking, and it is like a wake, it's like a funeral and what can we do, and you know the country has gone to rack an ruin and democracy has been thrown out of the window. You see that video, and then you hear about what was going on with regard to this particular search. I mean, it's hard not to think that there's some not bias against conservative thought.</p><p>MARTIN: Yes, it's upsetting. In Democracy being thrown out the window, when America voted and got --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: -- the result that they voted for, right? I mean, yes, democracy must be out the window in that case.</p><p>And you know, honestly, Ashley, as Google shareholder, it's disappointing both for myself and my clients. Facebook is another one. You know the news feed jiggering that they've done over the years.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: I mean, that stuff, you know, obviously was kind of tailored to certain ways. Twitter, Jack Dorsey has talked about how this was not a great, you know place for conservative thought.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: We own Facebook, by the way, still. I mean, gosh, Ashley, you know Silicon Valley has really shown their stripes here in the last couple of years.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: And it's not promising with respect to how they feel about D.C., that's for sure.</p><p>WEBSTER: No, it certainly doesn't.</p><p>All right, as always, Scott, great stuff, you can talk about any subject with a lot of skill, much appreciated. Scott Martin.</p><p>MARTIN: I'll try. See you, man.</p><p>WEBSTER: In Chicago, Scott, thank you and we'll be right back.</p><p>WEBSTER: Breaking today, the White House says it is very hopeful that trade deal deal with Canada could be reach by the end of the month.</p><p>For the very latest lets go to our very own Blake Burman, at the White House trying to keeping track of all this.</p><p>Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Ashley. We've got debrief from a White House official as it relates to pretty much the two main trade discussions going on right now with the United States, as they're trying to rework trade deals, Canada and China. The United States, The Trump administration at this point, much more optimistic with the way forward on Canada than as it relates to China.</p><p>Canada, a deal has to, when you weave through all the legal wrangling of this, essentially be worked out by the end of the month. And this White House official who gave us the debrief said, they are optimistic that something will get done.</p><p>The main sticking point, though, here is dairy. And here is what this White House official told us, \"It really is on Canada to decide speaking about a deal. We got a great deal and I think they should be very happy with a lot of the things with the deal with Mexico and they've got to decide, are they going to kill this deal with them because of their dairy program?\"</p><p>As you know, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has long complained about the tariff situation with Canada, and dairy. That is the main sticking point going forward with Canada. But the administration feels that something could potentially be worked out with Canada by the end of the month.</p><p>As it relates to China though there is a much more long-term view that the administration is taking with the Chinese as there are no official scheduled talks right now, between the United States and China. Though this White House official tells us there is communication, constantly between the two.</p><p>Here's what this White House official, though, told us, \"I don't know when China will finally commit to make the changes it needs to make. Obviously the I.P.,\" meaning I.P. theft, \"is a big one.\"</p><p>\"We're also talking to them about agricultural things. And we're talking to them about real structural changes and I hope it will be soon. I hope it's soon, but these agreements take time.\"</p><p>As for phase three of potential tariffs with China, Ashley, the $267 billion that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has threatened against China, this White House official not assigning a certain date as to when that could potentially come. And I asked that White House official is there anything down the pipeline as it relates to after the 267 billion potentially? This White House official says they do not want to go there just yet.</p><p>WEBSTER: No.</p><p>BURMAN: Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: I'm just talking about phase three is a bit kind of disappointing as well. But Blake Burman at the White House, Blake, thank you very much.</p><p>BURMAN: Thanks.</p><p>WEBSTER: Appreciate that.</p><p>Let's take a look at markets for you, on the upside on the Dow again up 66 points, the S&amp;P also just on the up side, the NASDAQ slightly lower. Have more on the markets when we come back.</p><p>WEBSTER: The takeover battle for British broadcaster Sky will be decided this weekend. British regulators say Comcast and 21st Century Fox, our parent company, will settle their takeover battle for Sky through an auction starting today.</p><p>And our Susan Li is here, she's been following this story. Isn't this an unusual way to kind of close out this deal?</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It's rare.</p><p>WEBSTER: Rare.</p><p>LI: Rare. Yes. It's only happened three times since 2007 in the U.K. that they've used this auction process --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>LI: -- to settle any assets. This is the biggest prize ever in the auction process.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LI: Thirty-five billion dollars and today was the deadline. So here the latest new is, today was the deadline for either Comcast or Fox to withdraw any of their cash bids. No one was going --</p><p>WEBSTER: No one has done that. No.</p><p>LI: So, Saturday is this going to be three rounds, first round, Fox bids. Second round, Comcast counter-bids.</p><p>WEBSTER: It's the way to --</p><p>LI: Then third round -- wait, wait, this is important because then you have --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LI: -- a seals envelope high drama bid and this is where game theory comes in, right? Because you don't know what the other side is bidding so you don't want to bid too much but you don't want to bid too low, where you don't win the actual auction.</p><p>WEBSTER: And then at the end you open the envelop and the Oscar goes to?</p><p>LI: Right. And that will be announced on Saturday evening by U.K. regulators and then shareholders of Sky have three weeks to decide who they want to choose. Obviously the higher bid will most likely get the better choice.</p><p>WEBSTER: And to confuse all of this so just a little bit more, Disney is buying a large number of assets of 21st Century Fox. So, do they inherently then go on and assume Sky?</p><p>LI: OK. So this is what happens --</p><p>WEBSTER: If Fox wins the bid.</p><p>LI: Its -- yes. So, it's very complicated because of that whole who owns who stays (ph) for who.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. Right. Right. Right.</p><p>LI: As we know, Disney of course winning the bid for Fox assets --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LI: -- Fox owns 39 percent of Sky. And then, so, lets say, you know, Comcast wins the bid --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>LI: --Disney still kind of wins because --</p><p>WEBSTER: They have to --</p><p>LI: -- they own 39 percent. And if that goes up to a high premium there, you know, if they decide to offload some of those Sky assets which no one says that they will at this point, they actually also get a higher pricing for the assets they already own. Does that make sense?</p><p>WEBSTER: It makes sense to me, it's a bit in the weeds, but this is a complicated process. So, where's the highest bid stand right now? Is it Comcast, of what?</p><p>LI: Comcast at nine --</p><p>WEBSTER: Thirty-five percent?</p><p>LI: So, I converted to U.S. dollars for --</p><p>WEBSTER: OK.</p><p>LI: -- our U.S. audience.</p><p>WEBSTER: Very good.</p><p>LI: It's at $19, its 14 pounds 75 cents --</p><p>WEBSTER: OK.</p><p>LI: -- something in that category. That's higher than the $18 and change the Fox has bid, but slightly higher. But we should point out where actual Sky is trading that $21.</p><p>So, what that tells you is that the market is anticipating obviously a very competitive bidding process and that price could go much, much higher. But it depends at the end of the day what you think Sky is worth. And from the actions that we've seen, you know, Fox has made several attempts to buy Sky. And the rest of Sky doesn't (INAUDIBLE) own.</p><p>WEBSTER: Is it that prized an asset?</p><p>LI: It is.</p><p>WEBSTER: Consider the price --</p><p>LI: Twenty-three million subscribers, right?</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LI: We talk about this in the UK.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LI: I mean sports, is probably the crown jewel at --</p><p>WEBSTER: From Italy.</p><p>LI: -- Sky broadcasting.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LI: Yet they also have a news division as well.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LI: This is an opportunity for both Disney and Comcast to increase their international footprint which is something they want to do, especially Comcast, which has such a domestic focused business, right?</p><p>WEBSTER: So, by Saturday night we should know.</p><p>LI: We should know what the bids are.</p><p>WEBSTER: What the bids are.</p><p>LI: And then the Sky shareholders vote.</p><p>WEBSTER: Good job. Complicated story but you made it clear.</p><p>LI: Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Susan Li thank you so much.</p><p>As we head towards the end of this hour we can say the Dow up another 60 points. What a week it's been for the markets, money continuing to come into Wall Street, the Dow at 26,717. Not bad. Can we hang on for the next hour to finish in the green?</p><p>And I don't think it's any surprise the Cleveland Browns win their first game in what nearly 639 days. They've gone 19 games out a win. They win and guess what?</p><p>Liz Claman isn't in today.

There is the  scene.  We are waiting for the President.  He's speech comes just hours  after that huge rally for Republican Senator Dean Heller where the  President defended Judge Brett Kavanaugh and touted the strength of our  economy and of course the stock market which is doing well again today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking of that market, we are looking at another record day on Wall  Street, the Dow, S&amp;P, hitting all-time highs again today.  It could be  101st record for the Dow since election day.  And it's up another 83  points.  The S&amp;P also up, look at the NASDAQ just slightly lower, but  overall another strong day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And good afternoon, everybody, I'm Ashley Webster in for Trish Regan.  And  welcome, everyone, to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>And as we wait for the President to take that stage in Las Vegas, I want to  get to our other top story, President Trump defending his Supreme Court  pick Judge Brett Kavanaugh as he calls on the accuser to come forward with  evidence so that we can learn more about the alleged sexual assault.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Christine Ford, the woman at the center of it the  controversy says she is willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary  Committee but only under her terms.  All for the latest on this, let's  bring in our Edward Lawrence on Capitol Hill.</p><p>And Edward, where do we stand on the issue of Dr. Ford testifying?  When  and if is that -- when is that going to happen?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, yes.  Ashley, all I can  say there was 10:00 deadline today and Senator Chuck Grassley set to say if  she is going to testify or not.  That came and went.  The negotiations are  ongoing.</p><p>Now, Senator Chuck Grassley still talking to committee members at this  hour.  Also key players like Senator Susan Collins related to how they want  to go forward with this.  And Ford's attorney has then negotiating with the  committee and she said Ford does wants to testify but under certain  conditions.</p><p>First, she wants to make sure that no lawyers asking questions, only the  members of the committee.  And Judge Brett Kavanaugh can't be in the room.   She also wants Kavanaugh to testify first.</p><p>The Senator Chuck Grassley has said that Kavanaugh testifying first is a  non-starter.  In fact, legal experts say that it is very unusual to have  the accused testify before the accuser puts the accusations on -- under  oath.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, AMERICAN LAWYER:  That is the most absurd, anti-due  process, anti-American concept.  You testify without having been formally  accused under oath?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Donald Trump venting his frustration on Twitter  saying that this is political stunt by Senator Dianne Feinstein saying she  held on to the letter to the very last minute to try and delay the  Kavanaugh confirmation.  President Trump adding that Democrats don't really  want answers to this, they just want to delay this confirmation.  Then he  tweeted, \"If the attack was as bad as she said, charges would have been  filed immediately with local law enforcement by her either or her loving  parents.\"</p><p>The Democrats for their part or Republicans for their part are sticking  with Kavanaugh as their candidate or nominee for the Supreme Court.   Democrats saying that a full investigation needs to happen including  testimony under oath.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS COONS (D), DELAWARE SENATOR:  I do hope that she testifies but I  deeply respect her hesitation, given the ways in which her life and her  family's life have already been disrupted by attacks, by disrespect, by  death threats.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And officially the meeting or a hearing on Monday has not been  canceled.  Brett Kavanaugh has said that he wants to testify under oath to  clear his name.  Again he could testify Monday.  We'll just have to see how  the negotiations end up.</p><p>Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Edward Lawrence, thank you so much, Edward.</p><p>And as we wait for the President I'm joined by assistant editor for \"Wall  Street Journal\" Editorial Page, James Freeman and American Majority CEO,  Ned Ryun.</p><p>Ned, let me begin with you.  I was looking at your notes on this.  You  said, we really have devolved into the theater of the absurd here.  What  part of this is the most absurd in your opinion?</p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  Where to start.  I mean, honestly, Dr.   Ford and her lawyers have been given every opportunity to bring forward her  accusations.  Even, Ashley they offered to send staff out to California to  have an interview with her.</p><p>And I think it's time we probably hit a stop button on this.  We got to the  point, now Democrats seem to think that the FBI is their personal  investigation arm.  And I know they got that impression when Comey was the  head of the FBI but that's not how it works.  The FBI does not have  jurisdiction.  Kavanaugh has already been through six background checks.</p><p>Ashley, I've been through a background check by the FBI for top security  clearance at the Pentagon.  They are extremely thorough.  They go anywhere  and everywhere and they dig into everything and then they ripple out start  asking as many people as possible.</p><p>I have to tell you if you've been through six background checks by the FBI,  somewhere, someone at some time would have said something about this and  not one peep until now.  And the second thing, as Edward was just saying  this is utterly absurd and flipped everything, including common sense on  its head to say Kavanaugh has to actually testify first before his accuser.   That's insane.</p><p>And, I have to tell you, for this lawyer to try and put up list of demands  and hold the Senate hostage with her demands is insane.  And I think what  Chuck Grassley and Republicans need to do is say, \"We gave you 10:00 a.m.  deadline.\"</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>RYUN:  \"We are going to continue with our meeting -- the hearing on Monday  and if you don't show up that's fine.  We will have a vote and move forward  with the people's business.\"</p><p>WEBSTER:  James, is the judge being treated fairly here?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  I think so.  I mean, quite an  odd spectacle.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'm sorry to interrupt.  Let me follow that up, a lot of leading  Democrats in my mind have already convicted him.  Comments likes he  committed --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- attempted rape but GOP happy to put him on the court.  You  can't say that thing.  The guy -- it's all alleged.  Where does he get his  reputation back?  It's the question.</p><p>FREEMAN:  He has been slammed in the media absolutely.  And we should point  out it's not just the President tweeting bout the way this was handled by  Senator Feinstein, sitting on --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- the accusation for months, not including it in more than 1000  questions that went to Judge Kavanaugh, not mentioning it during the  lengthy hearings on his nomination.  This is also caused a lot of what we  might call the liberal media to criticize him as well.  Senator Feinstein's  hometown paper in San Francisco, the chronicle.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of commentary in the \"Los Angeles Times,\" \"The New York  Times.\"  So this strategy of delaying and then springing this information  has really not served anyone.  I think Chairman Grassley and the Judiciary  Committee made a reasonable response to say, \"OK.  We will reopen this  process, even though Senator Feinstein you sat on the information for so  long.  We're going to have a hearing Monday.\"</p><p>Finally the professor has a chance to tell this story and, this spectacle - -</p><p>WEBSTER:  But under what conditions, you know.  You know, how can the  accused to go first when he doesn't really understand what the exact  accusations are?  He should be responding to them.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And why are her lawyers trying so hard to delay the moment when  she can share what she knows?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  Right.  I don't know.</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's beyond bizarre.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, Ned, will we ever get to the bottom of these  allegations?  I mean, based on the timeline, --</p><p>RYUN:  No, I don't think so.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- the recollections of Dr. Ford?</p><p>RYUN:  No, i don't think so.  I think that's what so pernicious about this  is I think it will come down to he said/she said.  You know right now there  are no corroborating witnesses to what happened over 35 years ago.  There's  a lot of gaps, there's a lot of inconsistencies.  And this really is a  vicious smear.</p><p>I go back to what Chuck Schumer said before this confirmation really begin,  \"We will do anything, basically anything and everything to stop this  confirmation from happening.\"  Well, they've clearly shown that any shred  of decency they have left they decided to go away with that and go after  and smear him, what I think a very vicious smear.</p><p>But Ashley, you said something that I think is very important.  In this  country, we have always operated in our legal system but even in society  with the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>RYUN:  And now we have this Orwellian view of, you're guilty until you can  prove yourself innocent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>RYUN:  This is a very vague accusation with a lot of details missing.  And  now people are saying, \"Well, Kavanaugh is guilty.\"  How on earth do we  even know what happened?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>RYUN:  And the sad part is, I don't know if we're ever going to get to the  bottom of it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And that's my question.  I don't think we can.</p><p>And James, what about GOP, some the Republican senators that may end up  opting out of voting for Brett Kavanaugh?  The Bob Corker, who else, we  have Jeff Flake, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, they may  just opt not to vote for him?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, that's possible.  But I think given that Chairman Grassley  has given this hearing, this opportunity for the professor to say her  peace.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't understand what the argument would be, unless, the result  of Monday and I think it should go forward Monday, unless that result is  that she raises issues that the judge doesn't have an answer for.  Other  than that, if we're at the same place where it's a accusation -- WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- but no additional detail, no further evidence, I don't know  what their argument would be.  And I think the reason this is getting  delayed so much is the people who really don't want to vote on this  nomination --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- are Democrats running in Trump states.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's right.  And that's why they're delaying it.</p><p>Ned, very quickly, didn't Anita Hill at least have the FBI investigate  Clarence Thomas?  And you know, I wouldn't say it was a huge investigation  but they were brought in for a small portion of that investigation.  Could  we not do that here?</p><p>RYU&amp;N:  They were, again, I don't know if we're really dealing with honest  brokers on the other side, Ashley.  If we say this, and it's delayed even  more days.  And then maybe something else will come up.  I'm sorry at the  end of the day, again I'm highly skeptical of all of this.  This really  smells to me like the left has a stall delay tactic to try and push this  back until, maybe, potentially past the midterms.</p><p>And so, what this is really all about, Ashley, the left is terrified of  losing the Supreme Court, the balance of it to an originalist like  Kavanaugh and taking away their favorite tool for expanding their  administrative state.  That is what this is all about.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I mean, can they push ahead and go with this, the Senate  Judiciary just go ahead and vote and then get it to the full Senate?</p><p>RYUN:  Sure.  And you know, you don't need to disbelief the professor to  also think that it's unreasonable with so little evidence to --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>RYUN:  -- end his career and this nomination.  And to think, regardless of  what happened, the process was abused by Democrats here.  There is a, way  for the Senate to evaluate nominees.  They didn't follow it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  I have to leave it right there.  As you can see this  is a North Las Wegas V.A. medical Center.  That's President Trump, moving  to the podium.  He's going to be signing a bill, more money for the  Veterans Affairs Department.</p><p>Let's listen here.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, thank you very  much.  Please.  It's great to be with you.  And thank you to Secretary  Wilkie, who is doing an incredible job, I have to say.  And also to the  great leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Some of those  great leaders are with us today.</p><p>Today, I'm honored to be at the North Las Vegas V.A. Medical Center to sign  into law a historic government funding bill that will renovate our nation's  military bases and provide great world-class care to our great veterans.   Unless you don't want it.  Unless you don't want it.</p><p>I want to thank your state's great senator, Dean Heller.  He has been so  helpful.  Dean has really been helpful.  He's worked all the way, right  from the beginning.  And this was very important for him.  But for working  so hard to get the bill passed and get it put right on my desk, and to pass  the groundbreaking V.A. reform.  There's never been reform like we've been  able to do over the last very short period of time.</p><p>Thank you, as well, to Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval for being such a  strong advocate for Nevada's veterans.  We're also -- thank you, Brian.   Thank you, Brian.</p><p>We're also very grateful to be joined by Nevada Attorney General Adam  Laxalt.  Thank you, Adam.  Great job.  Hear he's doing well.</p><p>To every veteran here today, we are eternally grateful for your noble  service to our nation.  I would like to ask all of the veterans with us now  to, please, proudly stand.  That's great.  That's great.</p><p>You're fantastic people.  You're really fantastic people.  Please.  Thank  you.  You really are.</p><p>And we're fighting to make sure that you get the care that you so richly  earned.  And today's legislation is one more promise that the Trump  administration is keeping.  And we've done a lot of promises, and we've  kept them all.  And this is another one for the veterans.</p><p>With this funding bill, we've increased the VA's budget to the largest  ever.  We are delivering the resources needed to fully implement crucial  V.A. reforms that, as you know, we've gotten.  You know the reforms.  We're  going to go over them in a minute, but they are some reforms.  And to  deliver for our great veterans, just the way I said I would constantly on  the campaign trail.</p><p>You backed me, and I back you.  That's the way it works, right?  That's the  way it's supposed to work in life.</p><p>And with our booming economy, which is now, I think we can easily say, the  greatest economy maybe we've ever had in our country.  Stock markets  yesterday, and I believe they're up today, so that means today.  But the  stock markets yesterday hit the highest they've ever been in the history of  our country.  And we've broken the record, now, over 100 times.  So we keep  breaking it, breaking it.</p><p>And actually, we have a long way to go.  There's tremendous potential.</p><p>So with our booming economy, I'm also proud to report that the veteran's  unemployment recently achieved its lowest level in more than 20 years.   That means a lot of jobs.  A lot of jobs are taking place.</p><p>Last year, I also signed into law the landmark V.A. Accountability Act.   You know all about that.  And that was something that was very important to  me.  Because you couldn't do anything, you couldn't -- if somebody was bad.   You got a lot of great people, but you have some bad ones.  You couldn't do  anything.  Now you can do it.</p><p>So I want to thank the dedicated Veterans Affairs doctors, nurses, and  staff members who join us.  Now, we're finally rewarding the many great  people at the VA, while also ensuring that those who mistreat our veterans,  we had people that really mistreated our veterans, they are now being held  accountable.  That's why it's called the V.A. Accountability Act.  And they  are being held, seriously, accountable.</p><p>Right, Mr. Secretary? He's had a lot of fun.  He's had a lot of fun.</p><p>We take care of our good ones, and the others are held accountable.  Right?   And there was no way you could hold them accountable.  They could be  sadists.  You had some of them, too.  It doesn't sound nice.</p><p>They could be thieves.  They could rob you blind.  They could steal money,  and you couldn't do anything about it.  Now you can do whatever you want.   Now you do what's right.</p><p>And you have a Secretary that's doing what's right.  He's tough and he's  smart.  It's true.</p><p>And I can tell you -- this is always a good sign, General Mattis was not  happy when I took him out of the Department of Defense.  You know, we were  going to have him for a short while.  And then we said, \"You know, he's  doing so good, we're going to keep him here.\" He wasn't happy, and that's  usually a good sign.  Isn't it, Governor? When they're not -- if they're  happy, that's not a good sign.  He wasn't happy.  He's still not happy.   But that's all right.  But you're happy, right?</p><p>In a few months -- and a few months ago, I was very proud to sign into law  another tremendous victory for our veterans.  Maybe this is the one that we  kept talking about and talking about -- 48 years.  They couldn't get it  approved.  It made so much sense.  I used to talk about it because I  thought I was this great guy that had this great vision.  It's called \"V.A.  Choice.\"</p><p>And I said, \"You know, if you have lines where you can't see a doctor for  two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, twelve days, eight days, how about one  day?  No good.\"  I said, \"I have an idea.  Send them out to a private  doctor.  We got great doctors, and they'll be taken care of immediately.   We'll pay the bill.\"  I thought it was like this great idea.</p><p>Well, they thought about it for 40 years.  They couldn't get it passed.  We  got it passed.  So we have, now, V.A. Choice.  So, now, if a veteran can't  get the care they need from the V.A. in a timely fashion, they have the  right to go see a private doctor.</p><p>Today, for the first time in American history, I am about to sign a bill  that will fully and permanently give our great and cherished veterans  choice, so you don't have to wait on line for 18 days to take care of a  simple -- I mean, we had people waiting on line with a simple problem that,  by the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill.  No more of  that.  If you have a line, you go see a doctor.  You get yourself taken  care of.  We take care of it.</p><p>OK? Good.  It was amazing.  It was amazing.</p><p>You would think that would have been easy to pass.  Well, there's a reason  it took so many years; it wasn't easy.  You have different groups and  different people.  But in the end, we all came together and we got it done.   V.A. Choice.</p><p>Here with us today is Vin Putignano, a Vietnam veteran who is a great guy,  who lives in Las Vegas.  And, now, through the Choice program, he can see  the specialist doctors that he needs while still getting his primary care  through the V.A. medical centers like this one.</p><p>And that's the other thing, there's so many great things that they do that  people don't recognize.  And you don't have to go out all the time to get  what you need, because so much of it is taking place here.  We have some  tremendously talented people.</p><p>I always hear about the incredible level of treatment and talent that the  doctors have.  You have really incredible doctors and nurses.  You had to  get to them; that was the problem.  But you have some tremendously talented  people.</p><p>So, Vin, I'd like you, if you would, to say a few words about V.A. Choice,  please.  Thank you, Vin.</p><p>VIN PUTIGNANO, VETERAN:  First of all, good morning.  Thank you, Mr.  President, for those kind words.  I wish my mom was here.  Because she  wouldn't believe you.</p><p>Anyway, it's an honor to stand with you --</p><p>WEBSTER:  As you were watching, this is from a V.A. Medical facility in  North Las Vegas, the President just wrapping up talking about signing an  appropriations bill and really highlighting the ability for Veterans to  have Choice.  If they can't get speedy medical care, they can now go to a  private doctor.  It will be covered by the V.A.  He said earlier the  President, listen, \"You back me on the campaign so I now back you.  I made  a lot of promises that I would help veterans and especially, the health  care.\"  He said, \"I'm making good on those promises.\"  And he says, \"Look,\"  he also by the way had took time to tout the markets which again are higher  today.</p><p>He talked about how the economy is booming.  And he also talked about V.A.  unemployment being at the lowest level in more than 20 years.  But the  basis for what the President is doing today is helping veterans and the no  Choice aspect of health care, a very important one.  It's been a big one  for a long time.</p><p>And the President believes that giving Veterans the ability to not only  speed up the process within the Veterans Affairs but also allow veterans to  go to private doctors if they can't get their care they need in timely  manner.  That is very important.</p><p>We're hearing the testimony of one particular vet who lives in Vegas with  the President standing on there.  Of course, we'll go back if the President  makes some more comments.</p><p>But I still have our guests with us, James and Ned are still with me.  Also  by the way joining is Fox News Contributor Jehmu Greene.</p><p>Jehmu, I'm not going to ask you about Veterans affairs.  What I do want to  ask you about prior to listening to the President in Vegas, they were  talking about the ongoing turmoil surrounding the nomination of U.S.  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>Both Ned and James said, \"Wait a minute, there's a point here where it's  getting ridiculous.\"  I read your notes.  You say it's getting ridiculous.   But for all the other reasons, you believe that the accuser should be heard  and the Republicans are ignoring the allegations being made.</p><p>JEHMU GREENE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  From the beginning of  this nomination there has been a rush to just ram this nomination through.   When you look at the hundreds of thousands of documents that Democratic  members of the Senate were asking for, that they were denied, but as it  relates to this accusation, what is the rush?</p><p>And I do find it odd that the 11 Republican men who are on that judiciary  committee and unfortunately for the Republicans, they don't have one woman  on the judiciary committee?  That blows my mind.  But for these 11 men,  they have not learned anything since we lived through the Anita hill  hearings.</p><p>And if we could take one step, one step back or even just a pause, take a  breath, and understand how hard it is for someone to come forward with  allegations like this.  How hard it is for someone to basically say, \"I'm  going to blow up my entire life to tell a story about something that  happened to me that was very traumatic.\"  There just does not seem to be  much empathy and way too much partisanship when we should be getting to a  place of human decency around these allegations.</p><p>And to come up with due process, why are they running away from due  process?  Why are they running away from the FBI investigating this?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well every -- so in that, let me bring in Ned.</p><p>GREENE:  In the same way --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Let me bring in Ned, let me bring in Ned very quickly because --</p><p>GREENE:  -- as they did with the Anita Hill accusation.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But Jehmu, let me just bring in Ned on that point because he  says, \"Wait a minute, it's the left that has abandoned due process,\" right?</p><p>RYUN:  They really have.  And Dr. Ford is being given every opportunity to  come forward and lay forth her accusations in front of the Senate Judiciary  Committee.  And, I can't, Ashley, Chuck Grassley has bent over backwards to  offer her every opportunity.</p><p>GREENE:  Absolutely not.</p><p>RYUN:  And she -- and now we're back -- oh absolutely has.  And now we're  in this back in forth of a list of demands.  I'm sorry, I think the thing  that's going to be shameful when this all said and done, if this doesn't  turn out to have any veracity, Ashley, then the Democrats would stoop to  this level to use this.  I think is pernicious because it then removes  legitimacy from future allegations.</p><p>And we all know, we can all agree.  There are men and women who have abused  others sexually.  This is a serious problem but to use this as a tool to  beat somebody over the head for political gain.  If this turns out to be  just a political gambit, this is disgusting.</p><p>WEBSTER:  James, I don't think the Republicans can be accused of trying to  ram this through?</p><p>FREEMAN:  No, they followed the process.  The -- and by the way these are  the duly-elected representatives of the people of this country.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The voters chose these senators.  They are doing the job.  Voters  gave them the Constitution gives them.  The idea that because they're not a  gender that this or that media observer wants but there is somehow not  legitimate I think is, is way off target.  But the process is what the  Constitution gives them.  It's their job.  It's not the job of the FBI to  make a judgment on whether someone is credible.  That is the job of the  United State Senate and that's what they're doing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Last point to you, Jehmu, let me just say this, one point that's  being made by Dr. Ford is that she wants Mr. Kavanaugh to go first.  But  how can he answer those accusations when he doesn't really know what they  are in detail?  It seems back to front to me.</p><p>GREENE:  Look, I don't think necessarily think Kavanaugh going first --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>GREENE:  -- to something that her attorneys should stick to.  But we have  to keep in mind that Republicans, 30 years ago, Orrin Hatch was saying the  exact opposite of what he is saying now and what your fellow guests just  said.  He was calling for the FBI to do an investigation.  So what is  different now?</p><p>FREEMAN:  No, what's different is that --</p><p>GREENE:  What is different is --</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- it was not a public allegations at that point.</p><p>GREENE:  -- that they have been trying to ram this through, from the very  beginning.  And all of the evidence is aligned to that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  James --</p><p>GREENE:  And certainly, there's been no bending over backwards.  There's  been a show up on this one day.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely has.</p><p>GREENE:  A week after this happened.  And that's the only opportunity you  get.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well they gave a deadline, today, Jehmu.</p><p>GREENE:  That's a one chance.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And that deadline apparently is come and gone.  They are trying  to get this thing resolved.  Trying to handle it in a timely manner and  it's dragging on.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think it also should be pointed out that Clarence Thomas - -</p><p>GREENE:  That it's a lifetime -- it's a lifetime appointment?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Clarence Thomas was confirmed --</p><p>GREENE:  And so yes, this is coming.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- with a lifetime appointment because the American people  decided.  He was unfairly accused.  They saw holes in Anita Hill's story.   And that put the political pressure, and it's why both parties, members of  both parties voted to confirm him.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We have leave it there, everyone.</p><p>GREENE:  And --</p><p>WEBSTER:  We could go for the rest of the day and through the weekend.   With James, Ned, Jehmu.  Thank you for being here to discuss it.  Obviously  more to come, thank you very much.</p><p>Now this, internal e-mails suggests that some Google employees wanted to  alter the search functions to counter President Trump's travel ban.  Is  this more evidence the Silicon Valley is fighting conservative voices.  The  intel is coming up on that.</p><p>Plus markets in record territory again today, how long can the bull run  last?  Years, so far.  We'll ask the experts, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  The Dow and S&amp;P continuing their run  into record territory today as President Trump touts the best U.S. economy  ever.</p><p>Joining me now Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski and from Vision 4 Funds  Distributors, Heather Zumarraga.  Thank you both for being here.</p><p>John, let me begin with you, the question is always been how long can this  Bull Run go?  I've had a number of analysts say recently we're in about the  seventh inning, would you agree with that?  And I'm not sure that's --</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST:  I don't know what that means, the  seventh inning.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>LONSKI:  But as long as --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Which they would suggest there we're 2/3 of the way through it.</p><p>LONSKI:  As long as profits grow.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I guess.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes, as long as you have a positive of outlook for profits --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- equally prices climb higher.  And I don't think that this rally  is going to be derailed over an extended period of time by higher interest  rates.  That's very important.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right. . LONSKI:  I think right now that's still the biggest danger.  But I think  that danger is going to remain well contained as long as we had inflation  expectations stuck forever at two percent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But I don't know if that's possible.  But, you know, Heather what  do you say?  We in the seventh inning we still juts in the fourth inning, I  don't know if you like this baseball analogies but what do you think?</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, VISION 4 FUNDS DISTRIBUTOR VP:  Sure well, we'll be in  the first inning if we get some of this trade disputes resolved between  NAFTA, and China, and the U.S. as well.  And seems like the markets are  getting used to trade tensions also and the Federal Reserve has set to hike  rates next week.  Despite all of this the markets are still setting new  records.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  President Trump is saying that the U.S. economy is booming.  So  perhaps if we get some of the trade disputes resolved, maybe we're in the  first inning.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well that wouldn't that be something?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  John, what about that?  The trade tensions are really been  shrugged off by these markets.  If in fact we do get deals with, you know,  with Mexico, Canada, the biggie China if we can get that all done, are we  open up a leg or two?</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes, the market could care less about the schedule implementation  of tariffs with China.  They start next week -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- $200 million of goods -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  But then --</p><p>LONSKI:  -- a 10 percent tariff, does someone who cares, you know?  I mean,  companies --</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  But that's a lot.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, it is a lot.</p><p>LONSKI:  Companies -- yes, their profit margins is a lot to suck it in a  little bit or they're going to find all --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But, we, the consumers end up in with -- </p><p>LONSKI:  I think it well.  I -- can the consumer afford to pay much more?</p><p>WEBSTER:  That makes sense.</p><p>LONSKI:  So you know, we had problems are now with auto sales and with home  sales because both autos and housing tend to be overpriced at least from  the viewpoint of the consumer.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  When the Fed talks about well contained inflation expectations  what the Fed is telling you is the consumer is not an idiot.  If companies  try to rise -- raise prices by much more than two percent or three percent  --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- what does the consumer do?  They just don't buy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know that's great, and that's a great point.</p><p>LONSKI:  Disciplining.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, go ahead Heather.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Look at Walmart.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Walmart customers may endure higher prices.  Assume Walmart CEO  saying that they may have to hike prices on goods from food and beverage  down to bicycles and consumer electronics.  So across the board but the  flip side of that, is Goldman Sachs actually said that the impact of  tariffs on rising prices that the threat of inflation just from tariffs  alone was only 0.3 of one percent expected.  So you know it's a tug-of-war.</p><p>You have Walmart saying prices are going to go up.  You have Goldman Sachs  saying yes they are going to go up but not that much.  So will it really  have a big impact on consumers in spending this holiday season?</p><p>WEBSTER:  And getting back to the markets, John, what could really knock  this off?  For one point they were saying whether the Fed gets over  enthusiastic and starts raising rates too quickly?  That doesn't seem to be  the case?  I mean what conceivably, is it just over when it's over?</p><p>LONSKI:  I think it's the only thing that would knock this market down is  suddenly when we find out that we grossly overestimated earnings growth.   And that in fact, we begin to become nervous about a possible contraction  of earnings.  I don't see that happening anytime soon.  Ultimately it's the  growth of profits that determine the return from equities.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  And profits are expected to grow, not only this year not only next  year, but into, what, 2020.  According to the consensus, they have  operating income, S&amp;P 500 up by 10 percent in 2020.</p><p>But one warning, there are growing number of economists that talk about a  possible recession but you can't have a recession without a shrinkage of  profit.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You're right.  You know what, Heather, and Charles Payne said  this earlier today.  He said this is the most hated bull run in history.   No one likes it.  It's been going on since 2009.</p><p>He says he loves that.  And, you know, which speaks to maybe there's still  a lot of money on the sideline that could come in.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, markets climb a wall of worry.  So the fact that there is  -- are still people on the sidelines waiting for this pullback that just  never happens is the reason why markets keep going higher.</p><p>I think people are on the sidelines saying, oh we're missing out despite  trade tensions and rising interest rates.  And that's why we keep heading  higher along with strong U.S. growth.  And around emerging markets doing  very well this week also because the dollar is weakening so that's helping  them.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, so that could be the seventh inning.  It could the  first inning.  It doesn't matter we're still in the game as they say.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Heather and John, we're already out of time, but thank you so  much.  I appreciate your time today.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Let's take a look at shares of Google if we can.  There's a story  out there about Google today, not particularly flattering.  The stock off  one percent down and a more than 12 bucks of 1,179, that's alphabetical as  the parent company of Google.</p><p>A report today shows that some Google employees proposed altering search  functions to counter President Trump's travel ban back when that happened.   It didn't actually happen.  That didn't the -- it wasn't put in place but  is it more evidence that big tech is biased against conservatives.  That's  the question.  We're on it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Internal e-mails from Google show some employees wanted to alter  the search results to counter President Trump's travel ban.  Now, according  to a \"Wall Street Journal\" report those suggestions never put in place, but  it does prompt questions across about political manipulation and stifling  of conservative ideas.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn has been following this story from Los Angeles.</p><p>And Hillary, what more is Google saying about this report?</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, hello, Ashley.</p><p>They're saying that they aren't taking any action against any of the  employees that were involved in this explosive e-mail chain that shows  employees of Google were plotting ways to fight back against the  President's travel ban when it was announced by trying to control what  users would see when they Google about the topic, in the e-mail chain,  first obtained by Fox News', Tucker Carlson tonight, Search Product Market  Manager Mackenzie Thomas lays out ideas and suggest terms that they should  change, saying they should, \"Actively counter prejudiced terms like the  words Mexico, Hispanic, and Latino and actively counter Islamophobic terms  like Islam, Muslim and Iran.\"</p><p>Thomas writing to a group of Google employees saying, \"I know this would  require a full on sprint to make happen, but I think this is the sort of  super timely and imperative information that we need as we know that this  country and Google, would not exist without immigration.\"</p><p>Now Google is framing the e-mail chain as just a brainstorm session among  junior level employees.  But Google's, Meryl Stone, now the head Consumer  Partnership at Google was on that chain.</p><p>Also Google's Global Public Policy Manager, Clement wolf, chimed in on the  chain asking how partisan should Google be on this issue?  Writing, \"To the  extent of my knowledge we've been breaching precedent if we only gave  highlights access to organizations that support a certain view of the world  in a time of political conflict.  Is that accurate?  If so we would be  willing to open access to highlights to NGOs that actually support the  ban?\"</p><p>Google gives me the statement in response saying that, \"These e-mails were  just a brainstorm of ideas, none of which were ever implemented.  Our  processes and policies would not have allowed for any manipulation of  search results to promote political ideologies.\"</p><p>And Ashley, they're telling me that they're taking no action against any of  these employees.  And no internal memo went out to the company, explaining  that this is against company policy.</p><p>Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very interesting, Hillary Vaughn, good stuff.  Thank you,  Hillary, appreciate it.</p><p>Well, it certainly doesn't speak well does it to accusations of big tech is  biased against conservatives.  Here with more reaction, Scott Martin CIO of  Kingsview Asset Management.</p><p>You know, Scott, OK, so we hear back from just a brainstorming, you know,  session never went into effect.  But it's certainly leaves the very bitter  taste when you start thinking about the way that these e-mails were and  worded was -- it's almost like it's us against them.</p><p>We've got to make sure, we've got to rush to get this in so that we can  combat the policies of the Trump administration.  To me it is very damning.</p><p>SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  Yes.  It's damning and damn  them.  Ashley, you know, thank you Google for doing this great service for  the country, and trying to tell us how to think, right?</p><p>I mean what's interesting too though, you know, they're not really good I  guess at burying searches, because if you Google internal e-mails, if you  Google search that, you find a litany of stories now about how they tried  to hide this stuff.  So, hey Google take a clue and maybe bury while you're  right (ph).</p><p>Here's the thing though, Ashley, like you and Hillary talked about, there  was very little leadership in this department, right.  I mean yes, I get it  some underlings, some lower level employee's maybe spouting off and blowing  off about Trump and the policies and what not fine.  But the fact that you  would have management on here kind of saying, \"Well, should we break  protocol and not doing this or do this?\"  Just goes to show you they really  didn't care and maybe actually even thought about doing it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, and then of course, this comes on the heels, and I don't  know Scott if you seen the video of Google executives seen that in that  period of time just after Donald Trump became President, and the role  sitting around having this kind of session talking, and it is like a wake,  it's like a funeral and what can we do, and you know the country has gone  to rack an ruin and democracy has been thrown out of the window.  You see  that video, and then you hear about what was going on with regard to this  particular search.  I mean, it's hard not to think that there's some not  bias against conservative thought.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, it's upsetting.  In Democracy being thrown out the window,  when America voted and got --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MARTIN:   -- the result that they voted for, right?  I mean, yes, democracy  must be out the window in that case.</p><p>And you know, honestly, Ashley, as Google shareholder, it's disappointing  both for myself and my clients.  Facebook is another one.  You know the  news feed jiggering that they've done over the years.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN:  I mean, that stuff, you know, obviously was kind of tailored to  certain ways.  Twitter, Jack Dorsey has talked about how this was not a  great, you know place for conservative thought.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MARTIN:  We own Facebook, by the way, still.  I mean, gosh, Ashley, you  know Silicon Valley has really shown their stripes here in the last couple  of years.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MARTIN:  And it's not promising with respect to how they feel about D.C.,  that's for sure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No, it certainly doesn't.</p><p>All right, as always, Scott, great stuff, you can talk about any subject  with a lot of skill, much appreciated.  Scott Martin.</p><p>MARTIN:  I'll try.  See you, man.</p><p>WEBSTER:  In Chicago, Scott, thank you and we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Breaking today, the White House says it is very hopeful that  trade deal deal with Canada could be reach by the end of the month.</p><p>For the very latest lets go to our very own Blake Burman, at the White  House trying to keeping track of all this.</p><p>Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Ashley.  We've  got debrief from a White House official as it relates to pretty much the  two main trade discussions going on right now with the United States, as  they're trying to rework trade deals, Canada and China.  The United States,  The Trump administration at this point, much more optimistic with the way  forward on Canada than as it relates to China.</p><p>Canada, a deal has to, when you weave through all the legal wrangling of  this, essentially be worked out by the end of the month.  And this White  House official who gave us the debrief said, they are optimistic that  something will get done.</p><p>The main sticking point, though, here is dairy.  And here is what this  White House official told us, \"It really is on Canada to decide speaking  about a deal.  We got a great deal and I think they should be very happy  with a lot of the things with the deal with Mexico and they've got to  decide, are they going to kill this deal with them because of their dairy  program?\"</p><p>As you know, President Trump has long complained about the tariff situation  with Canada, and dairy.  That is the main sticking point going forward with  Canada.  But the administration feels that something could potentially be  worked out with Canada by the end of the month.</p><p>As it relates to China though there is a much more long-term view that the  administration is taking with the Chinese as there are no official  scheduled talks right now, between the United States and China.  Though  this White House official tells us there is communication, constantly  between the two.</p><p>Here's what this White House official, though, told us, \"I don't know when  China will finally commit to make the changes it needs to make.  Obviously  the I.P.,\" meaning I.P. theft, \"is a big one.\"</p><p>\"We're also talking to them about agricultural things.  And we're talking  to them about real structural changes and I hope it will be soon.  I hope  it's soon, but these agreements take time.\"</p><p>As for phase three of potential tariffs with China, Ashley, the $267  billion that President Trump has threatened against China, this White House  official not assigning a certain date as to when that could potentially  come.  And I asked that White House official is there anything down the  pipeline as it relates to after the 267 billion potentially?  This White  House official says they do not want to go there just yet.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>BURMAN:  Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'm just talking about phase three is a bit kind of disappointing  as well.  But Blake Burman at the White House, Blake, thank you very much.</p><p>BURMAN:  Thanks.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Appreciate that.</p><p>Let's take a look at markets for you, on the upside on the Dow again up 66  points, the S&amp;P also just on the up side, the NASDAQ slightly lower.  Have  more on the markets when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  The takeover battle for British broadcaster Sky will be decided  this weekend.  British regulators say Comcast and 21st Century Fox, our  parent company, will settle their takeover battle for Sky through an  auction starting today.</p><p>And our Susan Li is here, she's been following this story.  Isn't this an  unusual way to kind of close out this deal?</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  It's rare.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Rare.</p><p>LI:  Rare.  Yes.  It's only happened three times since 2007 in the U.K.  that they've used this auction process --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>LI:  -- to settle any assets.  This is the biggest prize ever in the  auction process.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  Thirty-five billion dollars and today was the deadline.  So here the  latest new is, today was the deadline for either Comcast or Fox to withdraw  any of their cash bids.  No one was going --</p><p>WEBSTER:  No one has done that.  No.</p><p>LI:  So, Saturday is this going to be three rounds, first round, Fox bids.   Second round, Comcast counter-bids.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's the way to --</p><p>LI:  Then third round -- wait, wait, this is important because then you  have --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  -- a seals envelope high drama bid and this is where game theory comes  in, right?  Because you don't know what the other side is bidding so you  don't want to bid too much but you don't want to bid too low, where you  don't win the actual auction.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And then at the end you open the envelop and the Oscar goes to?</p><p>LI:  Right.  And that will be announced on Saturday evening by U.K.  regulators and then shareholders of Sky have three weeks to decide who they  want to choose.  Obviously the higher bid will most likely get the better  choice.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And to confuse all of this so just a little bit more, Disney is  buying a large number of assets of 21st Century Fox.  So, do they  inherently then go on and assume Sky?</p><p>LI:  OK.  So this is what happens --</p><p>WEBSTER:  If Fox wins the bid.</p><p>LI:  Its -- yes.  So, it's very complicated because of that whole who owns  who stays (ph) for who.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Right.  Right.  Right.</p><p>LI:  As we know, Disney of course winning the bid for Fox assets --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  -- Fox owns 39 percent of Sky.  And then, so, lets say, you know,  Comcast wins the bid --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>LI:  --Disney still kind of wins because --</p><p>WEBSTER:  They have to --</p><p>LI:  -- they own 39 percent.  And if that goes up to a high premium there,  you know, if they decide to offload some of those Sky assets which no one  says that they will at this point, they actually also get a higher pricing  for the assets they already own.  Does that make sense?</p><p>WEBSTER:  It makes sense to me, it's a bit in the weeds, but this is a  complicated process.  So, where's the highest bid stand right now?  Is it  Comcast, of what?</p><p>LI:  Comcast at nine --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Thirty-five percent?</p><p>LI:  So, I converted to U.S. dollars for --</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>LI:  -- our U.S. audience.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very good.</p><p>LI:  It's at $19, its 14 pounds 75 cents --</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>LI:  -- something in that category.  That's higher than the $18 and change  the Fox has bid, but slightly higher.  But we should point out where actual  Sky is trading that $21.</p><p>So, what that tells you is that the market is anticipating obviously a very  competitive bidding process and that price could go much, much higher.  But  it depends at the end of the day what you think Sky is worth.  And from the  actions that we've seen, you know, Fox has made several attempts to buy  Sky.  And the rest of Sky doesn't (INAUDIBLE) own.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Is it that prized an asset?</p><p>LI:  It is.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Consider the price --</p><p>LI:  Twenty-three million subscribers, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  We talk about this in the UK.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  I mean sports, is probably the crown jewel at --</p><p>WEBSTER:  From Italy.</p><p>LI:  -- Sky broadcasting.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  Yet they also have a news division as well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  This is an opportunity for both Disney and Comcast to increase their  international footprint which is something they want to do, especially  Comcast, which has such a domestic focused business, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  So, by Saturday night we should know.</p><p>LI:  We should know what the bids are.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What the bids are.</p><p>LI:  And then the Sky shareholders vote.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Good job.  Complicated story but you made it clear.</p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Susan Li thank you so much.</p><p>As we head towards the end of this hour we can say the Dow up another 60  points.  What a week it's been for the markets, money continuing to come  into Wall Street, the Dow at 26,717.  Not bad.  Can we hang on for the next  hour to finish in the green?</p><p>And I don't think it's any surprise the Cleveland Browns win their first  game in what nearly 639 days.  They've gone 19 games out a win.  They win  and guess what?</p><p>Liz Claman isn't in today.  Maybe celebrating a bit too much last night,  Lauren Simonetti?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Dilly-dilly.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Dilly-dilly, yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Ashley Webster.  Have a good weekend sir.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You too.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

There is the  scene.  We are waiting for the President.  He's speech comes just hours  after that huge rally for Republican Senator Dean Heller where the  President defended Judge Brett Kavanaugh and touted the strength of our  economy and of course the stock market which is doing well again today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking of that market, we are looking at another record day on Wall  Street, the Dow, S&amp;P, hitting all-time highs again today.  It could be  101st record for the Dow since election day.  And it's up another 83  points.  The S&amp;P also up, look at the NASDAQ just slightly lower, but  overall another strong day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And good afternoon, everybody, I'm Ashley Webster in for Trish Regan.  And  welcome, everyone, to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>And as we wait for the President to take that stage in Las Vegas, I want to  get to our other top story, President Trump defending his Supreme Court  pick Judge Brett Kavanaugh as he calls on the accuser to come forward with  evidence so that we can learn more about the alleged sexual assault.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Christine Ford, the woman at the center of it the  controversy says she is willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary  Committee but only under her terms.  All for the latest on this, let's  bring in our Edward Lawrence on Capitol Hill.</p><p>And Edward, where do we stand on the issue of Dr. Ford testifying?  When  and if is that -- when is that going to happen?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, yes.  Ashley, all I can  say there was 10:00 deadline today and Senator Chuck Grassley set to say if  she is going to testify or not.  That came and went.  The negotiations are  ongoing.</p><p>Now, Senator Chuck Grassley still talking to committee members at this  hour.  Also key players like Senator Susan Collins related to how they want  to go forward with this.  And Ford's attorney has then negotiating with the  committee and she said Ford does wants to testify but under certain  conditions.</p><p>First, she wants to make sure that no lawyers asking questions, only the  members of the committee.  And Judge Brett Kavanaugh can't be in the room.   She also wants Kavanaugh to testify first.</p><p>The Senator Chuck Grassley has said that Kavanaugh testifying first is a  non-starter.  In fact, legal experts say that it is very unusual to have  the accused testify before the accuser puts the accusations on -- under  oath.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, AMERICAN LAWYER:  That is the most absurd, anti-due  process, anti-American concept.  You testify without having been formally  accused under oath?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Donald Trump venting his frustration on Twitter  saying that this is political stunt by Senator Dianne Feinstein saying she  held on to the letter to the very last minute to try and delay the  Kavanaugh confirmation.  President Trump adding that Democrats don't really  want answers to this, they just want to delay this confirmation.  Then he  tweeted, \"If the attack was as bad as she said, charges would have been  filed immediately with local law enforcement by her either or her loving  parents.\"</p><p>The Democrats for their part or Republicans for their part are sticking  with Kavanaugh as their candidate or nominee for the Supreme Court.   Democrats saying that a full investigation needs to happen including  testimony under oath.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS COONS (D), DELAWARE SENATOR:  I do hope that she testifies but I  deeply respect her hesitation, given the ways in which her life and her  family's life have already been disrupted by attacks, by disrespect, by  death threats.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And officially the meeting or a hearing on Monday has not been  canceled.  Brett Kavanaugh has said that he wants to testify under oath to  clear his name.  Again he could testify Monday.  We'll just have to see how  the negotiations end up.</p><p>Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Edward Lawrence, thank you so much, Edward.</p><p>And as we wait for the President I'm joined by assistant editor for \"Wall  Street Journal\" Editorial Page, James Freeman and American Majority CEO,  Ned Ryun.</p><p>Ned, let me begin with you.  I was looking at your notes on this.  You  said, we really have devolved into the theater of the absurd here.  What  part of this is the most absurd in your opinion?</p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  Where to start.  I mean, honestly, Dr.   Ford and her lawyers have been given every opportunity to bring forward her  accusations.  Even, Ashley they offered to send staff out to California to  have an interview with her.</p><p>And I think it's time we probably hit a stop button on this.  We got to the  point, now Democrats seem to think that the FBI is their personal  investigation arm.  And I know they got that impression when Comey was the  head of the FBI but that's not how it works.  The FBI does not have  jurisdiction.  Kavanaugh has already been through six background checks.</p><p>Ashley, I've been through a background check by the FBI for top security  clearance at the Pentagon.  They are extremely thorough.  They go anywhere  and everywhere and they dig into everything and then they ripple out start  asking as many people as possible.</p><p>I have to tell you if you've been through six background checks by the FBI,  somewhere, someone at some time would have said something about this and  not one peep until now.  And the second thing, as Edward was just saying  this is utterly absurd and flipped everything, including common sense on  its head to say Kavanaugh has to actually testify first before his accuser.   That's insane.</p><p>And, I have to tell you, for this lawyer to try and put up list of demands  and hold the Senate hostage with her demands is insane.  And I think what  Chuck Grassley and Republicans need to do is say, \"We gave you 10:00 a.m.  deadline.\"</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>RYUN:  \"We are going to continue with our meeting -- the hearing on Monday  and if you don't show up that's fine.  We will have a vote and move forward  with the people's business.\"</p><p>WEBSTER:  James, is the judge being treated fairly here?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  I think so.  I mean, quite an  odd spectacle.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'm sorry to interrupt.  Let me follow that up, a lot of leading  Democrats in my mind have already convicted him.  Comments likes he  committed --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- attempted rape but GOP happy to put him on the court.  You  can't say that thing.  The guy -- it's all alleged.  Where does he get his  reputation back?  It's the question.</p><p>FREEMAN:  He has been slammed in the media absolutely.  And we should point  out it's not just the President tweeting bout the way this was handled by  Senator Feinstein, sitting on --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- the accusation for months, not including it in more than 1000  questions that went to Judge Kavanaugh, not mentioning it during the  lengthy hearings on his nomination.  This is also caused a lot of what we  might call the liberal media to criticize him as well.  Senator Feinstein's  hometown paper in San Francisco, the chronicle.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of commentary in the \"Los Angeles Times,\" \"The New York  Times.\"  So this strategy of delaying and then springing this information  has really not served anyone.  I think Chairman Grassley and the Judiciary  Committee made a reasonable response to say, \"OK.  We will reopen this  process, even though Senator Feinstein you sat on the information for so  long.  We're going to have a hearing Monday.\"</p><p>Finally the professor has a chance to tell this story and, this spectacle - -</p><p>WEBSTER:  But under what conditions, you know.  You know, how can the  accused to go first when he doesn't really understand what the exact  accusations are?  He should be responding to them.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And why are her lawyers trying so hard to delay the moment when  she can share what she knows?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  Right.  I don't know.</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's beyond bizarre.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, Ned, will we ever get to the bottom of these  allegations?  I mean, based on the timeline, --</p><p>RYUN:  No, I don't think so.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- the recollections of Dr. Ford?</p><p>RYUN:  No, i don't think so.  I think that's what so pernicious about this  is I think it will come down to he said/she said.  You know right now there  are no corroborating witnesses to what happened over 35 years ago.  There's  a lot of gaps, there's a lot of inconsistencies.  And this really is a  vicious smear.</p><p>I go back to what Chuck Schumer said before this confirmation really begin,  \"We will do anything, basically anything and everything to stop this  confirmation from happening.\"  Well, they've clearly shown that any shred  of decency they have left they decided to go away with that and go after  and smear him, what I think a very vicious smear.</p><p>But Ashley, you said something that I think is very important.  In this  country, we have always operated in our legal system but even in society  with the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>RYUN:  And now we have this Orwellian view of, you're guilty until you can  prove yourself innocent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>RYUN:  This is a very vague accusation with a lot of details missing.  And  now people are saying, \"Well, Kavanaugh is guilty.\"  How on earth do we  even know what happened?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>RYUN:  And the sad part is, I don't know if we're ever going to get to the  bottom of it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And that's my question.  I don't think we can.</p><p>And James, what about GOP, some the Republican senators that may end up  opting out of voting for Brett Kavanaugh?  The Bob Corker, who else, we  have Jeff Flake, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, they may  just opt not to vote for him?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, that's possible.  But I think given that Chairman Grassley  has given this hearing, this opportunity for the professor to say her  peace.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't understand what the argument would be, unless, the result  of Monday and I think it should go forward Monday, unless that result is  that she raises issues that the judge doesn't have an answer for.  Other  than that, if we're at the same place where it's a accusation -- WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- but no additional detail, no further evidence, I don't know  what their argument would be.  And I think the reason this is getting  delayed so much is the people who really don't want to vote on this  nomination --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- are Democrats running in Trump states.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's right.  And that's why they're delaying it.</p><p>Ned, very quickly, didn't Anita Hill at least have the FBI investigate  Clarence Thomas?  And you know, I wouldn't say it was a huge investigation  but they were brought in for a small portion of that investigation.  Could  we not do that here?</p><p>RYU&amp;N:  They were, again, I don't know if we're really dealing with honest  brokers on the other side, Ashley.  If we say this, and it's delayed even  more days.  And then maybe something else will come up.  I'm sorry at the  end of the day, again I'm highly skeptical of all of this.  This really  smells to me like the left has a stall delay tactic to try and push this  back until, maybe, potentially past the midterms.</p><p>And so, what this is really all about, Ashley, the left is terrified of  losing the Supreme Court, the balance of it to an originalist like  Kavanaugh and taking away their favorite tool for expanding their  administrative state.  That is what this is all about.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I mean, can they push ahead and go with this, the Senate  Judiciary just go ahead and vote and then get it to the full Senate?</p><p>RYUN:  Sure.  And you know, you don't need to disbelief the professor to  also think that it's unreasonable with so little evidence to --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>RYUN:  -- end his career and this nomination.  And to think, regardless of  what happened, the process was abused by Democrats here.  There is a, way  for the Senate to evaluate nominees.  They didn't follow it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  I have to leave it right there.  As you can see this  is a North Las Wegas V.A. medical Center.  That's President Trump, moving  to the podium.  He's going to be signing a bill, more money for the  Veterans Affairs Department.</p><p>Let's listen here.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, thank you very  much.  Please.  It's great to be with you.  And thank you to Secretary  Wilkie, who is doing an incredible job, I have to say.  And also to the  great leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Some of those  great leaders are with us today.</p><p>Today, I'm honored to be at the North Las Vegas V.A. Medical Center to sign  into law a historic government funding bill that will renovate our nation's  military bases and provide great world-class care to our great veterans.   Unless you don't want it.  Unless you don't want it.</p><p>I want to thank your state's great senator, Dean Heller.  He has been so  helpful.  Dean has really been helpful.  He's worked all the way, right  from the beginning.  And this was very important for him.  But for working  so hard to get the bill passed and get it put right on my desk, and to pass  the groundbreaking V.A. reform.  There's never been reform like we've been  able to do over the last very short period of time.</p><p>Thank you, as well, to Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval for being such a  strong advocate for Nevada's veterans.  We're also -- thank you, Brian.   Thank you, Brian.</p><p>We're also very grateful to be joined by Nevada Attorney General Adam  Laxalt.  Thank you, Adam.  Great job.  Hear he's doing well.</p><p>To every veteran here today, we are eternally grateful for your noble  service to our nation.  I would like to ask all of the veterans with us now  to, please, proudly stand.  That's great.  That's great.</p><p>You're fantastic people.  You're really fantastic people.  Please.  Thank  you.  You really are.</p><p>And we're fighting to make sure that you get the care that you so richly  earned.  And today's legislation is one more promise that the Trump  administration is keeping.  And we've done a lot of promises, and we've  kept them all.  And this is another one for the veterans.</p><p>With this funding bill, we've increased the VA's budget to the largest  ever.  We are delivering the resources needed to fully implement crucial  V.A. reforms that, as you know, we've gotten.  You know the reforms.  We're  going to go over them in a minute, but they are some reforms.  And to  deliver for our great veterans, just the way I said I would constantly on  the campaign trail.</p><p>You backed me, and I back you.  That's the way it works, right?  That's the  way it's supposed to work in life.</p><p>And with our booming economy, which is now, I think we can easily say, the  greatest economy maybe we've ever had in our country.  Stock markets  yesterday, and I believe they're up today, so that means today.  But the  stock markets yesterday hit the highest they've ever been in the history of  our country.  And we've broken the record, now, over 100 times.  So we keep  breaking it, breaking it.</p><p>And actually, we have a long way to go.  There's tremendous potential.</p><p>So with our booming economy, I'm also proud to report that the veteran's  unemployment recently achieved its lowest level in more than 20 years.   That means a lot of jobs.  A lot of jobs are taking place.</p><p>Last year, I also signed into law the landmark V.A. Accountability Act.   You know all about that.  And that was something that was very important to  me.  Because you couldn't do anything, you couldn't -- if somebody was bad.   You got a lot of great people, but you have some bad ones.  You couldn't do  anything.  Now you can do it.</p><p>So I want to thank the dedicated Veterans Affairs doctors, nurses, and  staff members who join us.  Now, we're finally rewarding the many great  people at the VA, while also ensuring that those who mistreat our veterans,  we had people that really mistreated our veterans, they are now being held  accountable.  That's why it's called the V.A. Accountability Act.  And they  are being held, seriously, accountable.</p><p>Right, Mr. Secretary? He's had a lot of fun.  He's had a lot of fun.</p><p>We take care of our good ones, and the others are held accountable.  Right?   And there was no way you could hold them accountable.  They could be  sadists.  You had some of them, too.  It doesn't sound nice.</p><p>They could be thieves.  They could rob you blind.  They could steal money,  and you couldn't do anything about it.  Now you can do whatever you want.   Now you do what's right.</p><p>And you have a Secretary that's doing what's right.  He's tough and he's  smart.  It's true.</p><p>And I can tell you -- this is always a good sign, General Mattis was not  happy when I took him out of the Department of Defense.  You know, we were  going to have him for a short while.  And then we said, \"You know, he's  doing so good, we're going to keep him here.\" He wasn't happy, and that's  usually a good sign.  Isn't it, Governor? When they're not -- if they're  happy, that's not a good sign.  He wasn't happy.  He's still not happy.   But that's all right.  But you're happy, right?</p><p>In a few months -- and a few months ago, I was very proud to sign into law  another tremendous victory for our veterans.  Maybe this is the one that we  kept talking about and talking about -- 48 years.  They couldn't get it  approved.  It made so much sense.  I used to talk about it because I  thought I was this great guy that had this great vision.  It's called \"V.A.  Choice.\"</p><p>And I said, \"You know, if you have lines where you can't see a doctor for  two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, twelve days, eight days, how about one  day?  No good.\"  I said, \"I have an idea.  Send them out to a private  doctor.  We got great doctors, and they'll be taken care of immediately.   We'll pay the bill.\"  I thought it was like this great idea.</p><p>Well, they thought about it for 40 years.  They couldn't get it passed.  We  got it passed.  So we have, now, V.A. Choice.  So, now, if a veteran can't  get the care they need from the V.A. in a timely fashion, they have the  right to go see a private doctor.</p><p>Today, for the first time in American history, I am about to sign a bill  that will fully and permanently give our great and cherished veterans  choice, so you don't have to wait on line for 18 days to take care of a  simple -- I mean, we had people waiting on line with a simple problem that,  by the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill.  No more of  that.  If you have a line, you go see a doctor.  You get yourself taken  care of.  We take care of it.</p><p>OK? Good.  It was amazing.  It was amazing.</p><p>You would think that would have been easy to pass.  Well, there's a reason  it took so many years; it wasn't easy.  You have different groups and  different people.  But in the end, we all came together and we got it done.   V.A. Choice.</p><p>Here with us today is Vin Putignano, a Vietnam veteran who is a great guy,  who lives in Las Vegas.  And, now, through the Choice program, he can see  the specialist doctors that he needs while still getting his primary care  through the V.A. medical centers like this one.</p><p>And that's the other thing, there's so many great things that they do that  people don't recognize.  And you don't have to go out all the time to get  what you need, because so much of it is taking place here.  We have some  tremendously talented people.</p><p>I always hear about the incredible level of treatment and talent that the  doctors have.  You have really incredible doctors and nurses.  You had to  get to them; that was the problem.  But you have some tremendously talented  people.</p><p>So, Vin, I'd like you, if you would, to say a few words about V.A. Choice,  please.  Thank you, Vin.</p><p>VIN PUTIGNANO, VETERAN:  First of all, good morning.  Thank you, Mr.  President, for those kind words.  I wish my mom was here.  Because she  wouldn't believe you.</p><p>Anyway, it's an honor to stand with you --</p><p>WEBSTER:  As you were watching, this is from a V.A. Medical facility in  North Las Vegas, the President just wrapping up talking about signing an  appropriations bill and really highlighting the ability for Veterans to  have Choice.  If they can't get speedy medical care, they can now go to a  private doctor.  It will be covered by the V.A.  He said earlier the  President, listen, \"You back me on the campaign so I now back you.  I made  a lot of promises that I would help veterans and especially, the health  care.\"  He said, \"I'm making good on those promises.\"  And he says, \"Look,\"  he also by the way had took time to tout the markets which again are higher  today.</p><p>He talked about how the economy is booming.  And he also talked about V.A.  unemployment being at the lowest level in more than 20 years.  But the  basis for what the President is doing today is helping veterans and the no  Choice aspect of health care, a very important one.  It's been a big one  for a long time.</p><p>And the President believes that giving Veterans the ability to not only  speed up the process within the Veterans Affairs but also allow veterans to  go to private doctors if they can't get their care they need in timely  manner.  That is very important.</p><p>We're hearing the testimony of one particular vet who lives in Vegas with  the President standing on there.  Of course, we'll go back if the President  makes some more comments.</p><p>But I still have our guests with us, James and Ned are still with me.  Also  by the way joining is Fox News Contributor Jehmu Greene.</p><p>Jehmu, I'm not going to ask you about Veterans affairs.  What I do want to  ask you about prior to listening to the President in Vegas, they were  talking about the ongoing turmoil surrounding the nomination of U.S.  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>Both Ned and James said, \"Wait a minute, there's a point here where it's  getting ridiculous.\"  I read your notes.  You say it's getting ridiculous.   But for all the other reasons, you believe that the accuser should be heard  and the Republicans are ignoring the allegations being made.</p><p>JEHMU GREENE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  From the beginning of  this nomination there has been a rush to just ram this nomination through.   When you look at the hundreds of thousands of documents that Democratic  members of the Senate were asking for, that they were denied, but as it  relates to this accusation, what is the rush?</p><p>And I do find it odd that the 11 Republican men who are on that judiciary  committee and unfortunately for the Republicans, they don't have one woman  on the judiciary committee?  That blows my mind.  But for these 11 men,  they have not learned anything since we lived through the Anita hill  hearings.</p><p>And if we could take one step, one step back or even just a pause, take a  breath, and understand how hard it is for someone to come forward with  allegations like this.  How hard it is for someone to basically say, \"I'm  going to blow up my entire life to tell a story about something that  happened to me that was very traumatic.\"  There just does not seem to be  much empathy and way too much partisanship when we should be getting to a  place of human decency around these allegations.</p><p>And to come up with due process, why are they running away from due  process?  Why are they running away from the FBI investigating this?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well every -- so in that, let me bring in Ned.</p><p>GREENE:  In the same way --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Let me bring in Ned, let me bring in Ned very quickly because --</p><p>GREENE:  -- as they did with the Anita Hill accusation.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But Jehmu, let me just bring in Ned on that point because he  says, \"Wait a minute, it's the left that has abandoned due process,\" right?</p><p>RYUN:  They really have.  And Dr. Ford is being given every opportunity to  come forward and lay forth her accusations in front of the Senate Judiciary  Committee.  And, I can't, Ashley, Chuck Grassley has bent over backwards to  offer her every opportunity.</p><p>GREENE:  Absolutely not.</p><p>RYUN:  And she -- and now we're back -- oh absolutely has.  And now we're  in this back in forth of a list of demands.  I'm sorry, I think the thing  that's going to be shameful when this all said and done, if this doesn't  turn out to have any veracity, Ashley, then the Democrats would stoop to  this level to use this.  I think is pernicious because it then removes  legitimacy from future allegations.</p><p>And we all know, we can all agree.  There are men and women who have abused  others sexually.  This is a serious problem but to use this as a tool to  beat somebody over the head for political gain.  If this turns out to be  just a political gambit, this is disgusting.</p><p>WEBSTER:  James, I don't think the Republicans can be accused of trying to  ram this through?</p><p>FREEMAN:  No, they followed the process.  The -- and by the way these are  the duly-elected representatives of the people of this country.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The voters chose these senators.  They are doing the job.  Voters  gave them the Constitution gives them.  The idea that because they're not a  gender that this or that media observer wants but there is somehow not  legitimate I think is, is way off target.  But the process is what the  Constitution gives them.  It's their job.  It's not the job of the FBI to  make a judgment on whether someone is credible.  That is the job of the  United State Senate and that's what they're doing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Last point to you, Jehmu, let me just say this, one point that's  being made by Dr. Ford is that she wants Mr. Kavanaugh to go first.  But  how can he answer those accusations when he doesn't really know what they  are in detail?  It seems back to front to me.</p><p>GREENE:  Look, I don't think necessarily think Kavanaugh going first --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>GREENE:  -- to something that her attorneys should stick to.  But we have  to keep in mind that Republicans, 30 years ago, Orrin Hatch was saying the  exact opposite of what he is saying now and what your fellow guests just  said.  He was calling for the FBI to do an investigation.  So what is  different now?</p><p>FREEMAN:  No, what's different is that --</p><p>GREENE:  What is different is --</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- it was not a public allegations at that point.</p><p>GREENE:  -- that they have been trying to ram this through, from the very  beginning.  And all of the evidence is aligned to that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  James --</p><p>GREENE:  And certainly, there's been no bending over backwards.  There's  been a show up on this one day.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely has.</p><p>GREENE:  A week after this happened.  And that's the only opportunity you  get.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well they gave a deadline, today, Jehmu.</p><p>GREENE:  That's a one chance.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And that deadline apparently is come and gone.  They are trying  to get this thing resolved.  Trying to handle it in a timely manner and  it's dragging on.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think it also should be pointed out that Clarence Thomas - -</p><p>GREENE:  That it's a lifetime -- it's a lifetime appointment?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Clarence Thomas was confirmed --</p><p>GREENE:  And so yes, this is coming.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- with a lifetime appointment because the American people  decided.  He was unfairly accused.  They saw holes in Anita Hill's story.   And that put the political pressure, and it's why both parties, members of  both parties voted to confirm him.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We have leave it there, everyone.</p><p>GREENE:  And --</p><p>WEBSTER:  We could go for the rest of the day and through the weekend.   With James, Ned, Jehmu.  Thank you for being here to discuss it.  Obviously  more to come, thank you very much.</p><p>Now this, internal e-mails suggests that some Google employees wanted to  alter the search functions to counter President Trump's travel ban.  Is  this more evidence the Silicon Valley is fighting conservative voices.  The  intel is coming up on that.</p><p>Plus markets in record territory again today, how long can the bull run  last?  Years, so far.  We'll ask the experts, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  The Dow and S&amp;P continuing their run  into record territory today as President Trump touts the best U.S. economy  ever.</p><p>Joining me now Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski and from Vision 4 Funds  Distributors, Heather Zumarraga.  Thank you both for being here.</p><p>John, let me begin with you, the question is always been how long can this  Bull Run go?  I've had a number of analysts say recently we're in about the  seventh inning, would you agree with that?  And I'm not sure that's --</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST:  I don't know what that means, the  seventh inning.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>LONSKI:  But as long as --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Which they would suggest there we're 2/3 of the way through it.</p><p>LONSKI:  As long as profits grow.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I guess.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes, as long as you have a positive of outlook for profits --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- equally prices climb higher.  And I don't think that this rally  is going to be derailed over an extended period of time by higher interest  rates.  That's very important.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right. . LONSKI:  I think right now that's still the biggest danger.  But I think  that danger is going to remain well contained as long as we had inflation  expectations stuck forever at two percent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But I don't know if that's possible.  But, you know, Heather what  do you say?  We in the seventh inning we still juts in the fourth inning, I  don't know if you like this baseball analogies but what do you think?</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, VISION 4 FUNDS DISTRIBUTOR VP:  Sure well, we'll be in  the first inning if we get some of this trade disputes resolved between  NAFTA, and China, and the U.S. as well.  And seems like the markets are  getting used to trade tensions also and the Federal Reserve has set to hike  rates next week.  Despite all of this the markets are still setting new  records.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  President Trump is saying that the U.S. economy is booming.  So  perhaps if we get some of the trade disputes resolved, maybe we're in the  first inning.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well that wouldn't that be something?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  John, what about that?  The trade tensions are really been  shrugged off by these markets.  If in fact we do get deals with, you know,  with Mexico, Canada, the biggie China if we can get that all done, are we  open up a leg or two?</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes, the market could care less about the schedule implementation  of tariffs with China.  They start next week -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- $200 million of goods -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  But then --</p><p>LONSKI:  -- a 10 percent tariff, does someone who cares, you know?  I mean,  companies --</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  But that's a lot.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, it is a lot.</p><p>LONSKI:  Companies -- yes, their profit margins is a lot to suck it in a  little bit or they're going to find all --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But, we, the consumers end up in with -- </p><p>LONSKI:  I think it well.  I -- can the consumer afford to pay much more?</p><p>WEBSTER:  That makes sense.</p><p>LONSKI:  So you know, we had problems are now with auto sales and with home  sales because both autos and housing tend to be overpriced at least from  the viewpoint of the consumer.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  When the Fed talks about well contained inflation expectations  what the Fed is telling you is the consumer is not an idiot.  If companies  try to rise -- raise prices by much more than two percent or three percent  --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- what does the consumer do?  They just don't buy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know that's great, and that's a great point.</p><p>LONSKI:  Disciplining.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, go ahead Heather.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Look at Walmart.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Walmart customers may endure higher prices.  Assume Walmart CEO  saying that they may have to hike prices on goods from food and beverage  down to bicycles and consumer electronics.  So across the board but the  flip side of that, is Goldman Sachs actually said that the impact of  tariffs on rising prices that the threat of inflation just from tariffs  alone was only 0.3 of one percent expected.  So you know it's a tug-of-war.</p><p>You have Walmart saying prices are going to go up.  You have Goldman Sachs  saying yes they are going to go up but not that much.  So will it really  have a big impact on consumers in spending this holiday season?</p><p>WEBSTER:  And getting back to the markets, John, what could really knock  this off?  For one point they were saying whether the Fed gets over  enthusiastic and starts raising rates too quickly?  That doesn't seem to be  the case?  I mean what conceivably, is it just over when it's over?</p><p>LONSKI:  I think it's the only thing that would knock this market down is  suddenly when we find out that we grossly overestimated earnings growth.   And that in fact, we begin to become nervous about a possible contraction  of earnings.  I don't see that happening anytime soon.  Ultimately it's the  growth of profits that determine the return from equities.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  And profits are expected to grow, not only this year not only next  year, but into, what, 2020.  According to the consensus, they have  operating income, S&amp;P 500 up by 10 percent in 2020.</p><p>But one warning, there are growing number of economists that talk about a  possible recession but you can't have a recession without a shrinkage of  profit.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You're right.  You know what, Heather, and Charles Payne said  this earlier today.  He said this is the most hated bull run in history.   No one likes it.  It's been going on since 2009.</p><p>He says he loves that.  And, you know, which speaks to maybe there's still  a lot of money on the sideline that could come in.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, markets climb a wall of worry.  So the fact that there is  -- are still people on the sidelines waiting for this pullback that just  never happens is the reason why markets keep going higher.</p><p>I think people are on the sidelines saying, oh we're missing out despite  trade tensions and rising interest rates.  And that's why we keep heading  higher along with strong U.S. growth.  And around emerging markets doing  very well this week also because the dollar is weakening so that's helping  them.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, so that could be the seventh inning.  It could the  first inning.  It doesn't matter we're still in the game as they say.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Heather and John, we're already out of time, but thank you so  much.  I appreciate your time today.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Let's take a look at shares of Google if we can.  There's a story  out there about Google today, not particularly flattering.  The stock off  one percent down and a more than 12 bucks of 1,179, that's alphabetical as  the parent company of Google.</p><p>A report today shows that some Google employees proposed altering search  functions to counter President Trump's travel ban back when that happened.   It didn't actually happen.  That didn't the -- it wasn't put in place but  is it more evidence that big tech is biased against conservatives.  That's  the question.  We're on it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Internal e-mails from Google show some employees wanted to alter  the search results to counter President Trump's travel ban.  Now, according  to a \"Wall Street Journal\" report those suggestions never put in place, but  it does prompt questions across about political manipulation and stifling  of conservative ideas.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn has been following this story from Los Angeles.</p><p>And Hillary, what more is Google saying about this report?</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, hello, Ashley.</p><p>They're saying that they aren't taking any action against any of the  employees that were involved in this explosive e-mail chain that shows  employees of Google were plotting ways to fight back against the  President's travel ban when it was announced by trying to control what  users would see when they Google about the topic, in the e-mail chain,  first obtained by Fox News', Tucker Carlson tonight, Search Product Market  Manager Mackenzie Thomas lays out ideas and suggest terms that they should  change, saying they should, \"Actively counter prejudiced terms like the  words Mexico, Hispanic, and Latino and actively counter Islamophobic terms  like Islam, Muslim and Iran.\"</p><p>Thomas writing to a group of Google employees saying, \"I know this would  require a full on sprint to make happen, but I think this is the sort of  super timely and imperative information that we need as we know that this  country and Google, would not exist without immigration.\"</p><p>Now Google is framing the e-mail chain as just a brainstorm session among  junior level employees.  But Google's, Meryl Stone, now the head Consumer  Partnership at Google was on that chain.</p><p>Also Google's Global Public Policy Manager, Clement wolf, chimed in on the  chain asking how partisan should Google be on this issue?  Writing, \"To the  extent of my knowledge we've been breaching precedent if we only gave  highlights access to organizations that support a certain view of the world  in a time of political conflict.  Is that accurate?  If so we would be  willing to open access to highlights to NGOs that actually support the  ban?\"</p><p>Google gives me the statement in response saying that, \"These e-mails were  just a brainstorm of ideas, none of which were ever implemented.  Our  processes and policies would not have allowed for any manipulation of  search results to promote political ideologies.\"</p><p>And Ashley, they're telling me that they're taking no action against any of  these employees.  And no internal memo went out to the company, explaining  that this is against company policy.</p><p>Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very interesting, Hillary Vaughn, good stuff.  Thank you,  Hillary, appreciate it.</p><p>Well, it certainly doesn't speak well does it to accusations of big tech is  biased against conservatives.  Here with more reaction, Scott Martin CIO of  Kingsview Asset Management.</p><p>You know, Scott, OK, so we hear back from just a brainstorming, you know,  session never went into effect.  But it's certainly leaves the very bitter  taste when you start thinking about the way that these e-mails were and  worded was -- it's almost like it's us against them.</p><p>We've got to make sure, we've got to rush to get this in so that we can  combat the policies of the Trump administration.  To me it is very damning.</p><p>SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  Yes.  It's damning and damn  them.  Ashley, you know, thank you Google for doing this great service for  the country, and trying to tell us how to think, right?</p><p>I mean what's interesting too though, you know, they're not really good I  guess at burying searches, because if you Google internal e-mails, if you  Google search that, you find a litany of stories now about how they tried  to hide this stuff.  So, hey Google take a clue and maybe bury while you're  right (ph).</p><p>Here's the thing though, Ashley, like you and Hillary talked about, there  was very little leadership in this department, right.  I mean yes, I get it  some underlings, some lower level employee's maybe spouting off and blowing  off about Trump and the policies and what not fine.  But the fact that you  would have management on here kind of saying, \"Well, should we break  protocol and not doing this or do this?\"  Just goes to show you they really  didn't care and maybe actually even thought about doing it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, and then of course, this comes on the heels, and I don't  know Scott if you seen the video of Google executives seen that in that  period of time just after Donald Trump became President, and the role  sitting around having this kind of session talking, and it is like a wake,  it's like a funeral and what can we do, and you know the country has gone  to rack an ruin and democracy has been thrown out of the window.  You see  that video, and then you hear about what was going on with regard to this  particular search.  I mean, it's hard not to think that there's some not  bias against conservative thought.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, it's upsetting.  In Democracy being thrown out the window,  when America voted and got --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MARTIN:   -- the result that they voted for, right?  I mean, yes, democracy  must be out the window in that case.</p><p>And you know, honestly, Ashley, as Google shareholder, it's disappointing  both for myself and my clients.  Facebook is another one.  You know the  news feed jiggering that they've done over the years.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN:  I mean, that stuff, you know, obviously was kind of tailored to  certain ways.  Twitter, Jack Dorsey has talked about how this was not a  great, you know place for conservative thought.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MARTIN:  We own Facebook, by the way, still.  I mean, gosh, Ashley, you  know Silicon Valley has really shown their stripes here in the last couple  of years.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MARTIN:  And it's not promising with respect to how they feel about D.C.,  that's for sure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No, it certainly doesn't.</p><p>All right, as always, Scott, great stuff, you can talk about any subject  with a lot of skill, much appreciated.  Scott Martin.</p><p>MARTIN:  I'll try.  See you, man.</p><p>WEBSTER:  In Chicago, Scott, thank you and we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Breaking today, the White House says it is very hopeful that  trade deal deal with Canada could be reach by the end of the month.</p><p>For the very latest lets go to our very own Blake Burman, at the White  House trying to keeping track of all this.</p><p>Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Ashley.  We've  got debrief from a White House official as it relates to pretty much the  two main trade discussions going on right now with the United States, as  they're trying to rework trade deals, Canada and China.  The United States,  The Trump administration at this point, much more optimistic with the way  forward on Canada than as it relates to China.</p><p>Canada, a deal has to, when you weave through all the legal wrangling of  this, essentially be worked out by the end of the month.  And this White  House official who gave us the debrief said, they are optimistic that  something will get done.</p><p>The main sticking point, though, here is dairy.  And here is what this  White House official told us, \"It really is on Canada to decide speaking  about a deal.  We got a great deal and I think they should be very happy  with a lot of the things with the deal with Mexico and they've got to  decide, are they going to kill this deal with them because of their dairy  program?\"</p><p>As you know, President Trump has long complained about the tariff situation  with Canada, and dairy.  That is the main sticking point going forward with  Canada.  But the administration feels that something could potentially be  worked out with Canada by the end of the month.</p><p>As it relates to China though there is a much more long-term view that the  administration is taking with the Chinese as there are no official  scheduled talks right now, between the United States and China.  Though  this White House official tells us there is communication, constantly  between the two.</p><p>Here's what this White House official, though, told us, \"I don't know when  China will finally commit to make the changes it needs to make.  Obviously  the I.P.,\" meaning I.P. theft, \"is a big one.\"</p><p>\"We're also talking to them about agricultural things.  And we're talking  to them about real structural changes and I hope it will be soon.  I hope  it's soon, but these agreements take time.\"</p><p>As for phase three of potential tariffs with China, Ashley, the $267  billion that President Trump has threatened against China, this White House  official not assigning a certain date as to when that could potentially  come.  And I asked that White House official is there anything down the  pipeline as it relates to after the 267 billion potentially?  This White  House official says they do not want to go there just yet.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>BURMAN:  Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'm just talking about phase three is a bit kind of disappointing  as well.  But Blake Burman at the White House, Blake, thank you very much.</p><p>BURMAN:  Thanks.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Appreciate that.</p><p>Let's take a look at markets for you, on the upside on the Dow again up 66  points, the S&amp;P also just on the up side, the NASDAQ slightly lower.  Have  more on the markets when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  The takeover battle for British broadcaster Sky will be decided  this weekend.  British regulators say Comcast and 21st Century Fox, our  parent company, will settle their takeover battle for Sky through an  auction starting today.</p><p>And our Susan Li is here, she's been following this story.  Isn't this an  unusual way to kind of close out this deal?</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  It's rare.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Rare.</p><p>LI:  Rare.  Yes.  It's only happened three times since 2007 in the U.K.  that they've used this auction process --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>LI:  -- to settle any assets.  This is the biggest prize ever in the  auction process.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  Thirty-five billion dollars and today was the deadline.  So here the  latest new is, today was the deadline for either Comcast or Fox to withdraw  any of their cash bids.  No one was going --</p><p>WEBSTER:  No one has done that.  No.</p><p>LI:  So, Saturday is this going to be three rounds, first round, Fox bids.   Second round, Comcast counter-bids.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's the way to --</p><p>LI:  Then third round -- wait, wait, this is important because then you  have --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  -- a seals envelope high drama bid and this is where game theory comes  in, right?  Because you don't know what the other side is bidding so you  don't want to bid too much but you don't want to bid too low, where you  don't win the actual auction.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And then at the end you open the envelop and the Oscar goes to?</p><p>LI:  Right.  And that will be announced on Saturday evening by U.K.  regulators and then shareholders of Sky have three weeks to decide who they  want to choose.  Obviously the higher bid will most likely get the better  choice.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And to confuse all of this so just a little bit more, Disney is  buying a large number of assets of 21st Century Fox.  So, do they  inherently then go on and assume Sky?</p><p>LI:  OK.  So this is what happens --</p><p>WEBSTER:  If Fox wins the bid.</p><p>LI:  Its -- yes.  So, it's very complicated because of that whole who owns  who stays (ph) for who.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Right.  Right.  Right.</p><p>LI:  As we know, Disney of course winning the bid for Fox assets --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  -- Fox owns 39 percent of Sky.  And then, so, lets say, you know,  Comcast wins the bid --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>LI:  --Disney still kind of wins because --</p><p>WEBSTER:  They have to --</p><p>LI:  -- they own 39 percent.  And if that goes up to a high premium there,  you know, if they decide to offload some of those Sky assets which no one  says that they will at this point, they actually also get a higher pricing  for the assets they already own.  Does that make sense?</p><p>WEBSTER:  It makes sense to me, it's a bit in the weeds, but this is a  complicated process.  So, where's the highest bid stand right now?  Is it  Comcast, of what?</p><p>LI:  Comcast at nine --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Thirty-five percent?</p><p>LI:  So, I converted to U.S. dollars for --</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>LI:  -- our U.S. audience.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very good.</p><p>LI:  It's at $19, its 14 pounds 75 cents --</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>LI:  -- something in that category.  That's higher than the $18 and change  the Fox has bid, but slightly higher.  But we should point out where actual  Sky is trading that $21.</p><p>So, what that tells you is that the market is anticipating obviously a very  competitive bidding process and that price could go much, much higher.  But  it depends at the end of the day what you think Sky is worth.  And from the  actions that we've seen, you know, Fox has made several attempts to buy  Sky.  And the rest of Sky doesn't (INAUDIBLE) own.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Is it that prized an asset?</p><p>LI:  It is.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Consider the price --</p><p>LI:  Twenty-three million subscribers, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  We talk about this in the UK.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  I mean sports, is probably the crown jewel at --</p><p>WEBSTER:  From Italy.</p><p>LI:  -- Sky broadcasting.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  Yet they also have a news division as well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  This is an opportunity for both Disney and Comcast to increase their  international footprint which is something they want to do, especially  Comcast, which has such a domestic focused business, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  So, by Saturday night we should know.</p><p>LI:  We should know what the bids are.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What the bids are.</p><p>LI:  And then the Sky shareholders vote.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Good job.  Complicated story but you made it clear.</p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Susan Li thank you so much.</p><p>As we head towards the end of this hour we can say the Dow up another 60  points.  What a week it's been for the markets, money continuing to come  into Wall Street, the Dow at 26,717.  Not bad.  Can we hang on for the next  hour to finish in the green?</p><p>And I don't think it's any surprise the Cleveland Browns win their first  game in what nearly 639 days.  They've gone 19 games out a win.  They win  and guess what?</p><p>Liz Claman isn't in today.  Maybe celebrating a bit too much last night,  Lauren Simonetti?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Dilly-dilly.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Dilly-dilly, yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Ashley Webster.  Have a good weekend sir.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You too.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

His tweets move everything from Pentagon policy on Syria and transgender service to how Republican lawmakers vote on surveillance law. Their frequent falsity is beside the point. It\u2019s the influence that matters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now Trump is trying to push a lasting structural change upon the internet, one that internet-freedom advocates fear will entrench a disincentive for any social media company to block disinformation on their platform. And it comes after Twitter, an open sewer for disinformation, took a very meager step to stop Trump from suppressing the vote in November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In signing an executive order on Thursday, Trump called for \u201cnew regulations\u201d with respect to the provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act permitting internet companies to remove or restrict content they host \u201cthat the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.\u201d The provision, Section 230, establishes that social-media and other internet content hosts are platforms, not publishers, and therefore not legally liable for what users say, do, or experience online.</p><p>Trump\u2019s proposal declared that \u201ca provider should properly lose the limited liability shield\u201d of Section 230 if it\u2019s found to \u201csilence viewpoints that they dislike.\u201d As a means for determining that, it called for \u201call executive departments and agencies\u201d to review how they were applying the provision and for a rule-making petition to be filed to the Federal Communications Commission within 60 days. Trump\u2019s order also instructed loyalist Attorney General Bill Barr to propose legislation \u201cuseful to promote the policy objectives of this order\u201d and advised heads of various government agencies to review the advertising dollars that they were spending on social media platforms.</p><p>Collectively, the order suggests social media companies may face penalties\u2014real or potential\u2014for attempting to police misinformation on their platforms. Either, according to longtime observers, is likely to be enough to prompt those companies to revert to their resting state: opening the sluice-gate of misinformation.</p><p>For the president\u2019s critics, it all amounts to a jarring sequence: To stay in power, Trump has taken a step toward erasing the already blurred line between what is and isn\u2019t true online.</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump is so committed to preventing Americans from voting that he spent weeks lying about vote by mail, and now he is trying to twist Section 230 and the First Amendment to force Twitter to spread these lies,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the provision\u2019s co-author.</p><p>For years, President Trump has viewed his relationship with social-media giants\u2014particularly Twitter, his favorite online medium\u2014as both adversarial and mutually beneficial. Much in the same way that the president has routinely assailed the credibility and perceived disloyalty of Fox News, but won\u2019t actually ditch the network, he takes a similar attitude toward a major online platform like Twitter, according to two people close to him. He often will complain. But he is extremely unlikely to take the ultimate step and personally abandon his own Twitter account.</p><p>Trump sees Twitter as one of his best communications assets. Though he insisted on Thursday that there was \u201cnothing\u201d more he \u201crather do than get rid of my whole Twitter account,\u201d he claimed he simply could not do so because it was his medium for going around the press corps. He credits the platform, in part, for how he was able to dominate the national conversation during his successful 2016 presidential run. He \u201cdoes not want to give up something he thinks helps him win,\u201d one of those sources said. That commitment hasn\u2019t stopped him from threatening the company to score political points or because he feels personally aggrieved.</p><p>Indeed, Thursday\u2019s executive order has been conceptually in the works for many months. According to two individuals familiar with the process, the Trump White House convened multiple meetings in the summer of 2019, inviting officials from the Justice Department, the FCC, the FTC, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to the White House to discuss crafting an executive order that similarly would have targeted social media giants\u2019 legal liability.</p><p>Those efforts were largely managed by White House domestic-policy aide James Sherk, a former labor economics analyst at the Heritage Foundation, who had the unenviable task of organizing a protracted drafting process demanded by an irked Trump. The intra-administration sessions caused predictable headaches, with officials unsure of how to reconcile the legal technicalities of the directive with Trump\u2019s demands and fits.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know if this was busy-work to satisfy one of the president\u2019s mood swings, or if we were actually getting something done,\u201d said one former senior Trump administration official.</p><p>In one of the early meetings that summer, the White House proposed language to agency officials that read as if the president was, for instance, ordering the FCC to redefine the liability shield of Section 230, the sources recounted. White House officials had to be reminded by agency envoys that Trump wasn\u2019t allowed to do that (though he can ask the NTIA to petition the FCC to conduct an independent review on the matter), and that such language would be quickly, and likely successfully, challenged. Still, many of the agency officials played along, for fear of upsetting the White House.</p><p>\u201cNobody in the room wanted to kill this,\u201d one of the sources familiar with the discussions said. \u201c[But] very few, if any, wanted anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Thursday\u2019s action is a culmination of that pent up frustration along with years\u2019 worth of right-wing objections that social media \u201cshadowbans\u201d right-wing content. That objection was dismissed by a federal appeals court on Wednesday, which found that conservatives suing Twitter and Facebook could not demonstrate that account deactivation for terms-of-service violations amounted to political suppression.</p><p>But the specific issue prompting Trump to act was not any generic grievance. It was his false assertion that voting by mail\u2014an expansion of which is under consideration because of the novel coronavirus that has killed 100,000 Americans in three months\u2014will lead to systematic voter fraud.</p><p>Twitter told CNN that the president\u2019s tweets promoted \u201cpotentially misleading information about voting processes.\u201d And, indeed, there\u2019s no evidence of meaningful voter-fraud related to mail-in balloting. In fact, five states, including Republican-run Utah, already vote entirely by mail.</p><p>\u201cTo be absolutely clear, absentee and mail voting in America is secure and election officials are confident in the security measures they have in place. It is critical this year that election officials ensure every American citizen has the option to vote absentee if they want to, and have safe polling place options,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \u201cThis is critical for public health and critical for the health of our democracy. The president\u2019s actions are making it harder for public officials to take the steps that they need to ensure a safe, secure, and healthy election this November.\u201d</p><p>Twitter\u2019s solution, however, was not to take down the erroneous tweets or ban Trump\u2019s account for a terms-of-service violation. Rather, it appended a hypertext alert below the tweet urging users to \u201cget the facts about mail-in ballots.\u201d</p><p>To Trump, this was \u201cBig Tech... doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 election,\u201d as he (naturally) tweeted Wednesday night. And he insisted that rectifying it by executive order would be tantamount to \u201ca Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a familiar distortion for those who dealt with the aftermath of Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign on social media during the 2016 election. One of them, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) pushed for internet companies to provide greater transparency around political ads on their platforms. Warner\u2019s measure sought to bolster the integrity of hosted content while sidestepping suggestions that the companies ought to determine what on their platforms is and isn\u2019t true. He expressed alarm at the \u201cbaseless\u201d claim Trump made about censorship and its implications for voter suppression.</p><p>\u201cWhile many of us have raised concerns for several years now about the opaque and inconsistent content moderation practices of large platforms and the ways that Section 230 has been unjustly invoked to protect platforms that facilitate fraud, widespread consumer harms, and civil rights violations, it\u2019s strange to see the president mimic some of those legitimate concerns in support of a baseless claim that he and fellow conservatives are being disadvantaged or censored online,\u201d Warner told The Daily Beast in advance of the executive order\u2019s release.</p><p>\u201cThe president has openly boasted about his prominence on social media, even while routinely violating the policies of each platform,\u201d Warner continued. \u201cThis latest effort to cow platforms into allowing Trump, dark money groups, and right-wing militias to exploit their tools to sow disinformation, engage in targeted harassment, and suppress voter participation is a sad distraction from the legitimate efforts to establish common sense regulations for dominant social media platforms.\u201d</p><p>The irony is that Twitter\u2019s tentative step toward confronting deceit on its platform is a departure from social-media firms\u2019 economic logic, in which what matters is the mass collection and commodification of user data, not hosting truthful discourse. That logic explains why Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg criticized Twitter for playing the \u201carbiter of truth.\u201d That position was also captured in a recently leaked memo from Facebook executive Andy Bosworth that compared ensuring veracity on Facebook to the temptations of JRR Tolkein\u2019s One Ring, a dark power that corrupts the ringbearer.</p><p>\"That 'dark power' notion is a rationalization meant to deflect attention from the economic imperatives central to the tech firms\u2019 business model,\" said Shoshana Zuboff, author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</emphasis> and a professor emerita at Harvard Business School.</p><p>\u201cTheir algorithms are tuned to maximize behavioral data intake into their supply chains for computation into behavioral predictions. They are compelled to extract data at scale and scope\u2026 that means volumes of as many kinds of data as possible. In this economic logic, there is no room for judging data content. The corporations are radically indifferent to whether data are true or false\u2014it\u2019s all the same to their revenue flows.\u201d Zuboff explained.</p><p>Section 230 was written before that economic logic took hold, when the model of the internet was a bulletin board rather than the \u201cbloodstream\u201d of contemporary life, Zuboff continued. And however content-agnostic social media companies portray their algorithms to be, those algorithms do push content on to users, as NBC\u2019s Ben Collins has documented with the spread on Facebook of the QAnon conspiracy theory.</p><p>\u201cMr. Trump wants to confront the power of these companies and how they operate, but instead of fighting for truth, he\u2019s fighting for the right to lie, to inject poison into the body politic,\u201d Zuboff said. \u201cThe tech companies and the government are in a larger existential battle right now, like two Death Stars battling each other. Both want to operate outside the rule of law and democratic norms.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2407423891</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-6MD1-DY0W-43HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Federal Communications Commission--FCC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Social networks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Liability</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Conservatism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political campaigns</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>False information</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Executive orders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Censorship</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political advertising</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fraud</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TitleKeyword: Twitter</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TitleKeyword: Donald J.

It's time for RELIABLE SOURCES. This is our weekly look at the story behind the story, of how the media really works, how the news gets made and how all of us can help make it better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this hour, we have breaking news from Alabama, where the state's biggest newspapers making a pretty bold statement about the state's new extreme anti-abortion bill.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Later, we're going to get into the truth about President Trump's wealth and how business beat reporters are leading the way.</p><p>Plus, we are keeping track of the administration's briefing room silence, 69 days. Why is it Gene Simmons is the only one standing at the Pentagon podium? Joe Lockhart is here to talk about.</p><p>But, first, the new abnormal, and that's involving the T word, treason. The president is continuing to accuse members of the intelligence committee of treason, an idea that only makes sense if you subscribe to the Sean Hannity cinematic universe.</p><p>On Friday, Trump tweeted out this conclusive claim that his campaign was spied on, and he said this was treason. He apparently liked the idea so much that he retweeted it, retweeting himself on Saturday.</p><p>So, why am I bringing it up now? The news media sighed, shrugged and moved on. It turns out, even cries of treason are not enough to spark breaking news coverage any more. Now, that may be a good thing, or that may be a bad thing. What do you think?</p><p>Even on Fox, Laura Ingraham barely took this idea seriously.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Treason means long jail sentences and this was treason.</p><p>Harmie (ph), we're almost out of time, but treason? Yes or no?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, it could be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: It could be. Yes or no -0 a yes or no answer for something as serious as this?</p><p>Now, I checked out the broadcast networks too, the only coverage of this treason tweet, the only show I could find that mentioned it at all on Friday was a comedy show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, COMEDIAN: He loves to say that there's a plot to prevent him from becoming president. Who would have bothered plotting that? Nobody thought he had a chance. It'd be like plotting to make sure Papa John's didn't take home the world's best pizza cup, which not something that was on anyone's mind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: Hey, for the record, I like Papa John's pizza.</p><p>But let's get back to the point. What is the president's rhetoric doing, how is the news media reacting and what is Bill Barr's role in all this? Why does he sound so much like Sean Hannity?</p><p>Joining me now to discuss, \"New York Magazine's\" Irin Carmon, also a CNN contributor, CNN media guru Oliver Darcy, and \"Vox\" senior political reporter, Jane Coaston.</p><p>Thanks, everybody for being here.</p><p>Jane, first to you. Is the press right to shrug off the president's extreme wild claims on Twitter these days?</p><p>JANE COASTON, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, VOX: I think so, because I think that we've seen time and time again that there's a distinct difference between Trump's Twitter feed and the Trump administration, one of those has the power of law behind it. We've seen in court proceedings in which the Trump administration has basically implied that Trump's tweets don't matter, because he doesn't know anything and is just tweeting.</p><p>And so, it's a fascinating move from -- I remember 2016, 2017 where we saw real economic turmoil result from Trump tweeting about a business. But now, it's where Trump airs his grievances, it's like Festivus all the time.</p><p>STELTER: As if none of it should matter.</p><p>COASTON: Right.</p><p>STELTER: There's a lot of rhetoric coming from Attorney Bill Barr that is similar to the presidents, also really similar to Sean Hannity.</p><p>We saw Barr give two interviews this week, Oliver. One was to Murdoch-owned \"The Wall Street Journal\", another was to the Murdoch- owned Fox News.</p><p>Let's take a look at how similar Bill Barr's language was with one of the biggest stars on Fox.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: After a near three-year witch hunt, or near three-year witch hunt, was conducted into all things Trump.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: But I think if I had been falsely accused, I'd be comfortable in saying it was a witch hunt.</p><p>HANNITY: We have been uncovering what is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history.</p><p>BARR: We should be worried about whether government officials abuse their power.</p><p>HANNITY: Democrats now fear of the attorney general. The attorney general will expose their hoax.</p><p>BARR: They may be concerned about the outcome of a review of what happened during the election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: So there we go, Barr/Hannity, Hannity/Barr.</p><p>Oliver, is Sean Hannity essentially the attorney general?</p><p>OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: Well, if you didn't know any better, Brian, you're watching Fox News, you might almost think that watching the interview that Bill Barr is one of the talking heads on Fox News, defending the president, casting everything as a deep state coup and delegitimizing a lot of the work that the DOJ has done. It's stunning.</p><p>It shouldn't be forgotten that this came on Fox News. Bill Barr gave this interview to Fox. He gave the other print interview to \"The Wall Street Journal\", both Rupert Murdoch-owned entities.</p><p>So, I think it's clear what he's trying to do. He's trying to send a message to one person who happens to read \"The Wall Street Journal\" and happens to watch Fox News quite a bit, and he's using the same rhetoric that Trump uses.</p><p>[11:05:09] So, you know, it's stunning. And I think one point to make too, is outside the opinion personalities there, there, some of the people on Fox found it stunning. Chris Wallace basically came on and said that it looked like he was, as the attorney general, trying to defend the president.</p><p>STELTER: To protect the president.</p><p>DARCY: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: And, Irin, I bring all this up because this is a cinematic universe. Either you subscribe to this conspiratorial view of the world or you don't. And most Americans don't, but the ones who do, they are deeply committed to these theories, that there was an attempt to take down President Trump.</p><p>IRIN CARMON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I have to say, Brian, I'm of the opinion that we should be freaking out when we see the word \"treason\". I'm of the opinion that if we were to take this administration at its word, we should all be running around like chickens with their heads cut off.</p><p>And I actually think -- I mean, Jane, I hear you. There is a disconnect between the Twitter handle and what happens in the administration. But as we know also from the Mueller report, that's also because a lot of the president's administration hasn't been listening to him, right, actually just treats him like some kind of nutty figure at times even though he guides all kinds of things like immigration policy.</p><p>But precisely because of the dynamic you're talking about, about Barr not being a challenge to Trump, I think we should take it very seriously. We have the president of the United States tweeting about a treason, while having an attorney general who sees himself as the wing man to the president. And I think that adds up to something deeply disturbing and I know we're all tired and the press can't treat everything like a crisis. But it is a crisis, and we often say that words matter, well, the words that the president of the United States is using matter.</p><p>STELTER: Well, let's use the example of something that's started on Twitter and has moved on into the administration action. The headline from \"The New York Times\" here saying, Trump wants your tales of social media censorship. Another headline from \"Vox\" saying the White House is doing this to try to get your email address.</p><p>What happens this week is the White House came out with this announcement they want to hear if you feel you've been censored on social media.</p><p>Oliver, what is this really about?</p><p>DARCY: I think this is about a broader cultural war. They know that Americans and the middle of the country, they think they're under attack by elitist institutions. Part of that is the media, the mainstream media, and now they're using big tech companies it seems like, big tech companies like Facebook, like Google, like Twitter. They said these guys are out to get, they're out to censor your ideas, you're under attack, and they're using that, effectively, fearmongering, and now, apparently trying to build up some sort of database, to send updates, and whatnot.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, I think 2016 was partly about Trump's attack on the media, this media, 2020, Irin, is about on social media, and an attack big tech.</p><p>CARMON: I mean, why choose? Why choose, right? I mean, in both instances, it's Trump working the reps, right? It's making media companies defensive when they're told that they have bias against conservatives. And if we're talking about censorship, to me, that's the concerning thing. The only entity that can infringe on the first amendment is the government.</p><p>You have the arm of the federal government, I think we should take this seriously too, pressuring private companies that have a right to moderate their forums, under the law, pressuring them in order to stoke the grievance of your voters, and using the government for that, I do think does infringe on people's First Amendment rights.</p><p>STELTER: And, Jane, you cover social media all the time. This is your focus at \"Vox\". How effective did you think these calls about censorship are?</p><p>COASTON: Well, I think they've proven to be very effective, I like to point out, there's a difference between conservatism and the GOP because conservatives are -- you're now hearing some conservatives and a lot of Republicans, making their argument, maybe it's time to regulate Facebook and Twitter. And I like to note, as Irin pointed out, because of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, Facebook and Twitter can kick off whomever they want and moderate your content. That is fine, because, you know, that is in the law, they have those protections.</p><p>But now you're seeing folks on the conservative side who generally opposed regulation in a kind of large sweeping way, saying, no, no, no, these companies are too big. It's surprising when you hear conservatives start sounding like Teddy Roosevelt talking about Standard Oil.</p><p>STELTER: At the same time, there is real legitimate reason to wonder about these tech companies, and how they enact their standards.</p><p>COASTON: That's true.</p><p>STELTER: It's not just limited; it's not unique to conservatives or liberals. It affects everybody.</p><p>COASTON: Right, exactly, and you're seeing that time and time again, who should get to decide what gets kicked off and what doesn't? Whose content gets monitored?</p><p>There have been some instances -- some great reporting in \"The Guardian\" talking about how African-American activists have their work censored. But then those activists had the FBI show up at their home, which goes far farther than some people getting their tweets deleted or shadow ban.</p><p>But it's also reflective of how important these tech companies become in every day life, because you hear from people saying like, why don't you get on Gab or use another social media platform? The response is, no, this is how I reach my family, this is how I want to do this.</p><p>[11:10:00] It just feels as if I'm being censored.</p><p>Again, not really clarifying what they mean by censored.</p><p>STELTER: By censored. COASTON: Because sometimes as people saying, I think this should have gotten more reach than it actually did, which is, you know, that's generally not what censorship is.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, whether the algorithm like more.</p><p>COASTON: Yes, exactly.</p><p>STELTER: In the middle, I have --</p><p>CARMON: It would make me have to have fans.</p><p>COASTON: Precisely, like no, no, my Instagram fans can't reach me.</p><p>DARCY: It's actually an incentive now almost to say that you were suspended or banned, because then you get a whole bunch of Fox News appearances, and your engagement actually shoots up. That's what happened with Diamond and Silk, remember?</p><p>STELTER: I see. That's very interesting.</p><p>DARCY: One point too is that these are very serious issues like you bring up. The problem is that they're being exploited by bad faith actors to suit their own political agenda. And I think that's what we're seeing, is it would be great if Congress, when it had people in front of the committees, they ask serious questions. Instead they bring Diamond and Silk to come on and mislead the committee and they're citing outlets like the Gateway Pundits, right wing blogs, to make these claims that will fall apart when you actually look at them. That's the problem.</p><p>COASTON: Exactly. And you have someone like Senator Ted Cruz who should know better, saying that Section 230 requires platforms to be neutral. It doesn't. Look at the law. There's no requirement that Facebook or Twitter or any means that uses third party information which could be the comments on the Infowars' article. There's no requirement that these platforms be neutral, it's just not in the law.</p><p>DARCY: Infowars says, unless it used to say in their own terms of services, that if you do not abide by the rules, we will kick you off and civilization has rules, expect to follow them or face the consequences. This is --</p><p>COASTON: Exactly. Precisely, exactly.</p><p>STELTER: Let me ask you, quickly, Oliver, about one other story, and that is the headline that you and I published this week on CNN.com about Elizabeth Warren rejecting Fox News, saying she's not going to show up for a town hall, she'd been invited, but she's kind of the only one right now, right? Just her and Kamala Harris have said they are not interested in appearing on Fox.</p><p>DARCY: Right, and Pete Buttigieg came out the other way and basically really released this letter saying that he wants to talk to the Fox News audience. And his argument was that if we don't talk to the Fox News audience, the hosts are going to color us and characterize us, and that's not something we should want.</p><p>I personally find that argument to be a bit naive -- Buttigieg saying that if we don't go on fox and talk to them for an hour the audience isn't going to know what we're standing for. I think that Fox News, you know, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, these people are going to misrepresent and provide misinformation to their audience about these candidates no matter, no matter if they go on or they don't go on. So, I don't know if one hour of a town hall is going to --</p><p>STELTER: Makes a difference?</p><p>DARCY: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: Look, Mayor Pete is on tonight. Other town halls are scheduled.</p><p>Irin, in 15 seconds, is Warren right that Fox is a paid for profit racket that Democrats should not help?</p><p>CARMON: This is a Democratic primary and she's speaking squarely to the Democratic primary audience. I think accepting the argument that Fox News is the way to reach conservatives, is insulting to conservatives, because if there's anyone who's persuadable, they're not watching Fox News.</p><p>STELTER: Interesting.</p><p>All right. Oliver, thanks for being here. Irin and Jane, please stick around.</p><p>Quick break here, and then dust on the briefing room podium. I'm serious. I want to ask what questions the White House is avoiding and why?</p><p>And later, winter is coming for \"Game of Thrones\". We're going to talk with Brian Lowry about the importance of this program and how it changed television, coming up.</p><p>[11:16:50] STELTER: As a symbol of the Trump White House's allergy to accountability, this is pretty perfect. Early this week, the briefing room podium was, to quote CNN's Meagan Vasquez, quite literally gathering dust. Someone has come in and dusted the podium.</p><p>But the briefing room still isn't getting any use. This is an unprecedented drought, 69 days, more than two months since Sarah Sanders last held an official press briefing. Sometimes, she does answer a few questions outside the White House after on Fox, but she's stopped doing what used to be a big part of the press secretary's job.</p><p>Here with me now the press secretary from the Clinton White House, now the host of \"The Words Matter\" podcast, Joe Lockhart.</p><p>Joe, I think our viewers might be thinking, but Sarah Sanders just lies anyway, what's the point of a briefing?</p><p>JOE LOCKHART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, even if she just lies, she will lie on camera and she will lie on tape. You will have it for history and posterity.</p><p>But also, the questions matter. You know, the White House has been able to cancel -- through cancelling the briefings, just slide by on a lot of things. For instance, the president tweeted this morning about the Republican congressman who basically called for his impeachment.</p><p>STETLER: Justin Amash, yes.</p><p>LOCKHART: Saying if he read the report, he'd know this. Well, no one's asked the president's press secretary if the president's read the report, and whether -- and been able to go into questions, well, what does he think about page 123?</p><p>So the questions do matter and it does matter. I think in a much better sense, the briefing was a way for the public to stay engaged with the White House. If they wanted to, they could tune in every day and say, the White House has an answer for not just what the president's doing, but what the entire administration is doing and the rest of the administration is getting away with a lot of stuff that doesn't get surfaced because the briefings don't happen any longer.</p><p>STELTER: And other parts of the government are becoming less accessible as well.</p><p>LOCKHART: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: The Pentagon has not had a spokesperson stand at the podium and answer questions in nearly a year. We did see KISS front man Gene Simmons stand on the podium though the other day, taking pictures.</p><p>In light of all the concern about Iran, and I think we can put up some of the headlines about, you know, talk of attacks, concerns about Iranian behavior, it's all the more reason why it's worrisome not to have this kind of access on camera.</p><p>LOCKHART: Well, I mean, it was highly unusual that the national security adviser made the announcement on Iran about moving the carrier group and not the Pentagon.</p><p>I saw a high ranking, former high ranking military official who made the excellent point that military families depend on the Pentagon briefing to know what their family members are doing. So, even if you don't think the press matters, the Pentagon has basically cut off access to all these families in the United States who have loved ones who are deployed. It creates confusion.</p><p>And as \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported this week, we almost went to war based on a misunderstanding. You don't have -- when you're out there answering questions, being transparent, you don't have misunderstandings.</p><p>STELTER: How would you size up the coverage this week of the concerns, the heightened tensions with Iran, was -- were there too many parts of the American media helping contribute to this war drum beating?</p><p>LOCKHART: Well, I think there were no facts, so what you had was, speculation, and what the White House briefing allows you to do is put facts out there, and to say, here's what the president believes, here's what he doesn't believe.</p><p>[11:20:09] It isn't just what John Bolton is leaking.</p><p>And there's a second piece for to why the briefing is important, it enforces discipline in the White House. If you have a briefing every day at 1:00, you are forced to make decisions.</p><p>STELTER: Ahh!</p><p>LOCKHART: You can't just continue to kick them down the road.</p><p>STELTER: Right, it's interesting.</p><p>LOCKHART: I can't tell you how many times there was a dispute, and I'd say that there are two different policy people, well, if you want me to decide at 1:00, I will.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, need some answer.</p><p>LOCKHART: So, it enforces a discipline and forces that discipline across the government which they don't have.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER: There hasn't been a briefing. There hasn't been a briefing since the Mueller report came out.</p><p>LOCKHART: Right.</p><p>STELTER: You know, it's been almost two months, it's been more than eight weeks since Mueller handed in his report.</p><p>LOCKHART: Right.</p><p>STELTER: We still haven't heard him on camera. I think it's ridiculous.</p><p>LOCKHART: No -- listen, I can understand why Sarah Sanders can no longer going to the briefing room. She admitted under oath that she lied.</p><p>STELTER: To lying to the press. Yes.</p><p>LOCKHART: But there's no reason, the job isn't about Sanders, the job is about the person who represents the president to the public. They can get someone else. They -- and doing it in the driveway doesn't cut it. You can't -- you know, people can't prepare for that they can't take it live and put it on --</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>LOCKHART: -- the way you can at briefing.</p><p>So, you know, the -- whether it's Sarah Sanders or not, they ought to be doing these things. And again, it's -- from my experience, you know, someone sent me the statistic last week that during 1998 when the president of the United States was being impeached, the Clinton press office did more briefings than any briefing at any time in the history of the White House.</p><p>One of the reasons we did that was because we had an agenda, and we wanted to stick to that agenda and get our message out and we did it every single day. The White House now responds, all they do is respond to whatever the media drives every day, so it's not only a -- something that the public has lost, it's something the White House has lost.</p><p>STELTER: Has lost.</p><p>Joe, great to see you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>LOCKHART: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: One more note about upcoming books, \"The Mueller Report\" still number one in paperback. In two weeks, a new book comes out. Michael Wolff's sequel to \"Fire and Fury\". It's called \"Siege\". The publisher says it will be equally explosive as the first, and I have a feeling the White House is going to want to respond to that book.</p><p>All right. Quick break here, and then President Trump. The hunt for his tax returns, and other information about his financial records and his past. We're going to talk to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Susanne Craig in just a moment.</p><p>[11:25:54] STELTER: As Democrats reached for Donald Trump's tax returns and asked more about his business dealings, his financial past, present and future is one of the best beats in journalism right now. Of course, Trump the businessman has been a big story for decades. There's been great journalism and also some big mistakes.</p><p>Back in 1990, Trump made his first solo appearance on the cover of \"Forbes\" magazine. But the inside story was far from glamorous. It detailed his growing losses and debt, leading Trump to publicly slam the publication.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INTERVIEWER: It says that you have a debt about $3.2 billion and that you're losing money at the rate of $40 million a year. True?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, BUSINESSMAN: Forbes has been after me for years, consistently after me. They took properties and devalued the properties. They say the Plaza Hotel is not worth what everybody knows it's worth. It's a total hatchet job. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: So, even back in 1990, Trump's true net worth is something journalist was trying to crack. Well, this month, \"The New York Times\" not only confirmed \"Forbes'\" reporting from back then, it also exposed a lot more, revealing Trump lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer between 1985 and 1994.</p><p>And that's just one of the recent explosive reports we've seen across the press. \"The Washington Post\" has been covering Trump's misuse of charity donations, now there's more foundation. ProPublica and WNYC had been exposing Ivanka Trump's relationship with Donald Trump's finances. There's been a lot of great investigative work going on, countless reports about Trump's reliance as well on hiring undocumented immigrants, to work at his hotels and golf clubs.</p><p>Just this week, CNN spoke with 19 undocumented immigrants who say they work for Trump and believe he had to have known about their status.</p><p>So, stories about Trump and his businesses come from many different angles. There's a lot to report on. Of course, at the same time, there have been a lot of times the -- a lot of cases over the past few decades where the press has lifted Trump up, has made him seem richer than he actually was. This is not just on 'The Apprentice\". This was on the covers of magazines, this was on the covers of magazines and pages of newspapers.</p><p>Some news reports failed to check the false perceptions surrounding Trump's wealth. They just took his word for it. In 1994, Trump tricked the press into reporting that British royals, the Princess Charles and Princess Diana were joining Mar-a-Lago, a way to boost his club. News outlets are reporting that Trump handled the paperwork himself, relying only on his word and the word of a membership director.</p><p>This is just -- Buckingham Palace actually had to come out and slam the report as utter rubbish a week later. But let's go back even further in time, \"The New York Times\" was guilty of Trump's images. This was back in 1976, in an article profiling Trump as a budding developer, touted him as tall, lean and blonde with dazzling white teeth. He looks ever so much like Robert Redford. I mean, he kind of did back then.</p><p>And famously, in 1984, Trump pretended to be a Trump Organization official and lied about his finances to a \"Forbes\" reporter so he could be in the Forbes 400 list. And it worked.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN GREENBERG: OK, what's your first name, by the way?</p><p>JOHN BARRON (TRUMP): John.</p><p>GREENBERG: John.</p><p>JOHN BARRON (TRUMP: John Barron. Mr. Trump, bought -- first of all, most of the assets have been consolidated to Mr. Trump, you know, because you have down Fred Trump. But I think you can really use Donald Trump now, and you can just consolidate it.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: From accepting his claims as fact to now exposing Trump where it hurts him the most. The financial beat time and time again is where this action is.</p><p>With me now is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Susanne Craig. She's been on the team covering Trump's tax returns.</p><p>And, of course, you were famously once slipped one of those tax return documents.</p><p>SUSANNE CRAIG, GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I was.</p><p>STELTER: Most recently your investigation \"A Decade in the Red\" has revealed more about his past.</p><p>CRAIG: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: Why do you think there's so much focus on this topic now?</p><p>CRAIG: Well, I think the main inflection point was the Democrats are now in control and they've got subpoena power, they're requesting his taxes, we actually have motion. So, things are moving. And I think that's been in the last six months really critical in terms of, he's now fighting, it appears he's willing to go to court to stop his tax information coming out. I think it's created a motion that we didn't have before when Republicans were in control.</p><p>STELTER: How much do you think -- right.</p><p>CRAIG: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: Going back decades and looking at some of those examples in the past, how much do you think the press is at fault for building up Trump's image as a billionaire businessman?</p><p>CRAIG: I think they're very complicit. I think four years Trump's wealth was sensationalized and it wasn't seen and it allowed for you know, him to create this myth. It started when he was really very young and it's -- there's been people who've questioned it along the way.</p><p>STELTER: Right. That's --</p><p>CRAIG: -- and you even noted our article that we wrote in 1976 from the New York Times. That article said he was worth -- he repeated his claim $200 million. Everything he was claiming in that article, pretty much everything was owned by his father. We now know looking back his -- he reported taxable income that year of $25,000, the same year he was telling the truth New York Times he was worth $200 million.</p><p>And it was a spectacular con. And over and over and over it was repeated and that lie was sewn into history.</p><p>STELTER: So there were people all along questioning his wealth --</p><p>CRAIG: There definitely were but --</p><p>STELTER: But there were many, many other reporters kind of contributing to a narrative that was inflated.</p><p>CRAIG: Yes, I think you see that there was the exception and not the rule. And I think that people loved the glamor. We've gone back and looked at interviews he's done and people were interviewing him in his helicopter, in his penthouse, and they just they loved the dazzle of it and there wasn't a lot of information about his companies -- on his company because it's privately held.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>CRAIG: So nobody really did know what was there and now it's starting to come out as we're getting a lot of this financial information.</p><p>STELTER: It makes you wonder who's being built up right now the way that Trump was built up in the 80s. It makes you wonder who's you know, who's being inflated right now. You know, you and I were both in Phoenix at this business conference over the weekend. What do you share with student journalists and young journalists who want to be doing what you're doing?</p><p>CRAIG: I think just really to question claims. It doesn't matter who they're from, but question it and just be really skeptical of things. I mean, I think Donald Trump is a real lesson that these -- you can have somebody who sets the tracks down for a narrative and you know it can get repeated over and over, and it's wrong and it just becomes something that is assumed when it's wrong and you see now.</p><p>It's incredible when you look at the -- even the last story we did. We looked at ten years from 85 to 95, the year that he wrote Art of the Deal, this master of the universe book about what a great deal maker he was, he had $42.4 million in core business losses that year. Like if there was any period if I would have guessed not having seen his taxes when I first saw them, I would have guessed, well maybe the year he wrote that book.</p><p>STELTER: Right, right.</p><p>CRAIG: You know, I don't know. I grew up in the prairies and there's you know, a saying all hat and no cattle for guys who do stuff like this, and you sort of see that with him and just how this has continued. It's -- really it's amazing when we've gone back and tried to unwind it.</p><p>STELTER: And as you obtain documents, primary source documents, those are more powerful -- CRAIG: Yes -- no, and we have now -- and we have we've had now tax returns, transcripts, and as well we've had a huge amount of tax and banking information on his father that's given us just this incredible look into Donald Trump's own finances in a way and that was a story we did last year.</p><p>STELTER: Still a lot more to learn though. Susanne, thanks for being here.</p><p>CRAIG: Thank you.</p><p>STELTER: Great to see you.</p><p>CRAIG: Great to see you.</p><p>STELTER: Up next here on RELIABLE SOURCES, a voice about the abortion debate that you might not be used to hear.</p><p>[11:35:00] STELTER: Women's reproductive rights were a lead story this week all across the media world, doing part to Alabama's watershed abortion ban. These bills are spreading mostly across the south trying to spark a Supreme Court review of Roe v Wade. I think the press has done a pretty good job of explaining that this week, but as you watch the coverage in the weeks and the months ahead, listen to the voice as you hear and try to notice what you don't hear as well.</p><p>I want to show you a few clips from religious broadcasters and how this abortion issue is being covered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Many Americans regard this procedure as murder.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Abortion is more important than life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It perpetuates this culture of death.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: I'm joined now by Catherine Hadro. She's the host of Pro- Life Weekly on Catholic Network EWTN, the Eternal Word Television Network. and Catherine, thanks for being here. One of those clips is from your show. Frankly, I think a lot of yours are going to be surprised to hear that there is a program, a weekly program devoted to pro-life issues and that's what you host.</p><p>CATHERINE HADRO, HOST, EWTN: Yes. And just some context, EWTN is the largest religious media network and our -- you know, our network feels it's so important to dedicate an entire show solely dedicated to the pro-life issue.</p><p>STELTER: Do you see a distinction between what I would call conservative media led by Fox News and religious broadcasters or Christian media? Is there a distinction? HADRO: Absolutely. And even a distinction between Christian media and Catholic media.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>HADRO: You know, we are not beholding to any political party. We're beholding to what the Catholic Church teaches.</p><p>STELTER: Yes. What are you focusing on your program that you think is lost in the -- I'm going to use the word mainstream although I hate the word, the mainstream news coverage of this topic, you know, the nightly newscast coverage of this topic.</p><p>HADRO: Right. I know. We will be full of lots of things we need to cover. This week I plan to welcome a woman on the program who actually was conceived and raped. I've not been seeing a lot of coverage, any voices like hers. So we will be bringing those kinds of voices on to EWTN.</p><p>And I do want to highlight one thing that I think is an egregious mistake I've been seeing in a lot of mainstream media. And again, I don't mean to belittle or bully mainstream media. I don't think they are the bad guys if you will. But there's this egregious mistake that Alabama would incriminate women and that is just not right at all. This is being pushed in groups like Business Insider, Glamour Magazine, but it's not true.</p><p>STELTER: So do you think they're miss reading the bill?</p><p>HADRO: I think they're missing the bill, maybe not reading it at all. I mean it's only three pages and it states that perfectly clear that women will not be incriminated, it would only be abortionist.</p><p>STELTER: What do you see from your audience about what they want to know more about? I mean, I was looking at a poll from Pew from last September asking whether abortion should be legal in most cases -- I mean, n all or most cases. Even among Catholics is split there. 51 percent of Catholics saying it should be legal in all or most cases, overall in the United States 58 percent. Do you sense that divide within your broadcasting world?</p><p>HADRO: So I think EWTN viewers are particularly loyal Catholics and are attending mass regularly and know that they need to prioritize life. When I hear back from viewers, they keep me on my toes. They are closely following pro-life legislation. And if I'm not able to cover one specific bill, they ask, hey, how can you even cover this? So they really do keep me on my toes and they do prioritize life in a voting booth, absolutely.</p><p>STELTER: When you say prioritize life though, I think what other -- what other hear of that -- about that is they're so focused on the 40 weeks of pregnancy and now on 40 or 80 years of a person's life after that.</p><p>HADRO: No -- I mean, there is this misconception that the pro-lifers are only pro-birth and that is absolutely not true. We want to uphold the sanctity of every life which brings me back to this point too, the AP Stylebook. If you look at the way that they define pro-life, they refer to us an anti-abortion whereas they describe pro-choicers as pro-abortion right as opposed to abortion advocates.</p><p>So they paint those who perpetuate abortion in the positive light whereas those who uphold the sanctity of light in this negative light as anti-abortion. And while I'm certainly anti-abortion, I believe in the sanctity of every human life, especially definitely those in the womb.</p><p>[11:40:20] STELTER: It's interesting at CNN we're discouraged from saying pro-life or pro-choice. People can describe themselves however they want but for us, it's abortion rights advocates, right. There's other language around this to avoid pro-life and pro-choice as the two terms.</p><p>HADRO: And so, of course, mainstream media if you will, is going to follow at the AP Stylebook says, but I think that speaks to all the more views and wise shows like EWTN Pro-Life Weekly are so important so that we can give a voice to pro-lifers.</p><p>STELTER: I noticed you recently had Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on.</p><p>HADRO: That right.</p><p>STELTER: So you certainly have a decent amount of access to the Trump administration.</p><p>HADRO: You know, one thing I've noticed is that they have been very -- in some cases, not always, responsive. Recently Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made some major pro-life announcements. We put out a request and he was pretty responsive which to me indicates that they realize the importance of having religious media, you know covering what they are doing and especially in the life issue.</p><p>And I do also want to point out. There are more Catholics in the world than there are American citizens. So it's not like this is -- this snitch network or anything. There -- we have a huge mission that we need to serve.</p><p>STELTER: That you're speaking beyond the U.S. --</p><p>HADRO: Absolutely.</p><p>STELTER: -- and including on YouTube, I've noticed. Catherine, thanks for being here.</p><p>HADRO: Thanks for having me, Brian.</p><p>STELTER: Great to see you.</p><p>HADRO: Thank you.</p><p>STELTER: More on this in just a moment including some local papers in Alabama, what they're putting on their front page this morning. We'll show you right after this.</p><p>[11:45:00] STELTER: We are back talking about coverage of anti- abortion legislation. And this reader letter to the New York Times says it best. The headline here, I don't even know how to talk to the other side about this.</p><p>Well, today, the three biggest papers in the State of Alabama are banded together to put this on the front page. You'll see this is the same front page in all the papers. The editor telling me that what they've done is they've elevated women's voices in Alabama because they feel the debate in the legislature was so male-dominated. So the voices of 200 women in Alabama on the cover of the big papers is there.</p><p>Let me bring Irin and Jane back here with me from our panel earlier. Irin, how would you size up the coverage in the past week of these bills and you know, we're talking about this happening suddenly but it's been slow-motion story that's picking up steam lately.</p><p>IRIN CARMON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. So I have been covering the debate, the political, and the grassroots and the access questions around abortion for the better part of a decade. And it's obvious that the last two weeks people have started paying attention to it. I think it's a tricky story to cover accurately for anybody because these are -- the stated intents of these laws are to ban abortion in 100 percent at all times, but in the short term they're not going to go into effect.</p><p>And so I think that there's a tension between showing the true impact of the laws which would be to cut off abortion access entirely, and to show that the short-term reality that it's not going to happen. So you actually had a lot of abortion providers talking about how their patients are calling them and they're so worried that they have to cancel their appointments.</p><p>So as journalists, obviously, we don't want to spread misinformation but we also want people to know what the stakes are too.</p><p>STELTER: There was a headline from BuzzFeed that we can put on screen trying to track misinformation that's spreading about abortion. What is perhaps the biggest point of misinformation that's out there? Is it that these bills are not actually going into effect right now?</p><p>CARMON: So there's a few things. One, I think a point of misinformation is even when we use phrases like the abortion divide, it implies that there's a 50-50 situation. You cited in your previous segment, in fact, a majority of the country supports legal access to abortion in every single poll.</p><p>If you put aside fuzzy words like pro-life and pro-choice which are sort of 50-50 but people don't define the terms, you actually have a majority of Americans supporting Roe v Wade, supporting access to legal abortion, not wanting to see it. You can slice and dice it any way you want but that is -- that's the fact that comes out. What you do have instead is a very engaged minority that has figured out --</p><p>STELTER: Is this asymmetric intensity -- asymmetric intensity, the idea that one side much more passionate and intense about an issue than the other side?</p><p>CARMON: So I know many very intense abortion rights activist. However, it is the case that in states like Alabama and Georgia and Missouri, the political process has been such that people have taken over their local parties, they have been in the grassroots, they've been running crisis pregnancy centers, they have been creating their own media like Catherine.</p><p>So you have a political process that doesn't reflect public opinion and that is in part a function of the fact that anti-abortion voters -- and by the way, they're also anti-contraception in many cases are voting on this. The other piece of misinformation I think that happens is that a lot of these laws have misinformation embedded within them and I think that as journalists we should be really careful.</p><p>For example, even fetal heartbeat. What your doctors will tell you that at six weeks, there is no heart. There is, in fact, electric pulse that sounds like a heartbeat. There are laws that make claims that abortion causes cancer which have been disproved by every single medical establishment.</p><p>So again -- or that a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks. These are all completely disproven fact so I think it's journalists when we're reporting on them, we have to make it really clear that these are political claims are not factual or medical ones.</p><p>STELTER: Right, not factual claims. Jane, you wrote for Vox about how even some conservatives think that this Alabama law has gone too far, and that's going to be a big storyline going forward.</p><p>JANE COASTON, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, VOX: Well, I think that it -- you know, I think we need to separate going too far morally and going too far strategically.</p><p>STELTER: Strategically.</p><p>COASTON: Because you're hearing from a lot of conservatives and there are a number of conservatives who support abortion rights and I think you've heard from a couple of them this week. But you know, I would say the vast majority think of themselves as opposing abortion.</p><p>And so for both Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, the support that that's gotten has been largely in the basis of believing that these bills are morally correct. I've heard -- the example though, I think Ben Shapiro, the conservative pundit use the example of talking about the abolition of slavery and saying that you cannot -- everyone can be William Lloyd Garrison going as hard against what you know, these groups or people believe to be the evil of abortion when you actually need to think about the strategic elements.</p><p>For example, there are concerns that the Alabama bill with the lack of exceptions with regard to rape and incest, and also for how the lawmakers behind the bill talked about it. For example, when someone raised the point of like what would happen to a fertilized egg at a fertility clinic, and the response was well, that doesn't count. It's not a woman, she's not pregnant. Which the response being like oh this is starting --</p><p>[11:50:08] CARMON: It's about targeting women.</p><p>COASTON: -- this is -- yes, it starts to look -- even if you are any pro-life voter it starts to look like this has less to do with protecting life and more to do with targeting women who might be wanting to you know, take care of their own bodies.</p><p>But I think that how did this issue -- you know, it's really important to -- and I've been explaining -- my spouse is from outside the United States and where this issue is not as big a deal, but I've been trying to explain it this has been a near 40-year debate that we've been having in the United States and especially pro-life voters having conversations with each other.</p><p>You know, you heard that during kind of the partial-birth abortion controversy and you've heard that sense, but there are some conservatives or concerns that even if this is morally correct, it strategically a bad idea especially if you're hoping to get it before the Supreme Court.</p><p>STELTER: Right. Jane, Irin, thank you both for being here. Great to see you. A quick break here and then much more on RELIABLE SOURCES in just a moment.</p><p>STELTER: All right, I have a confession. I've never seen Game of Thrones, but I think I'm the only one left. I mean, look at these ratings. 43 million people are watching all these episodes in the final season.</p><p>So tonight is the final episode, the final season, so I'm giving it over to you Brian Lowry. You've got a minute. Tell us what I'm missing. What's the significance of Game of Thrones?</p><p>[11:55:17] BRIAN LOWRY, CNN MEDIA CRITIC: Well, I think -- I think Game of Thrones is really kind of the perfect show in a way for this age of television. The analogy I've used is that if The Sopranos and Star Wars had a baby it would be Game of Thrones.</p><p>So it would -- it's a show with a serialized storyline that people can get into and the passion at fan base of a Star Wars movie or the Avengers franchise that gets people talking about it at a moment where everybody is on Twitter making you feel like you have to watch.</p><p>You know, the one misconception there Brian is that you are not in the minority, obviously. It's just if you're on Twitter tonight at about 10:20, you're going to feel like you're in the minority.</p><p>STELTER: Right. That's a very good point. So I have 15 seconds left. Is it too late for me to start binge watching it from the very beginning?</p><p>LOWRY: Well, the episodes will be there forever.</p><p>STELTER: True.</p><p>LOWRY: So no tonight is the 73rd episode. If you -- if you don't care if you've heard a few things, you can start now and you'll be done in about three or four weeks.</p><p>STELTER: All right. Maybe I'll try it. Brian Lowry, thanks so much. Good to see you. We'll have full coverage after the finale on cnn.com. Thanks for joining us and we'll see you right back here this time next week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Trump\u2019s order would allow federal officials to reconsider Section 230 and its protections, and require the Federal Trade Commission to investigate complaints about political bias on Big Tech platforms. </p><p>The merits of Section 230 are certainly worth debate. Companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have been allowed to operate under free speech protections while policing their own platforms for speech they deem harmful. So it\u2019s fair to argue that Big Tech wants to have its cake and eat it too. </p><p>But Trump\u2019s proposal would make things worse. Giving a government agency power over Big Tech would essentially allow the government to treat Facebook and Twitter like public utilities, which gives the government the right to pre-approve moderation policies, etc. Elizabeth Warren proposed a similar policy during her presidential campaign, and there\u2019s a reason most conservatives spoke out against it. Because no matter the motivation, giving a federal agency the power to regulate Big Tech and the internet would stifle efficiency and creativity, both of which make the internet vital, and it would ultimately result in corruption and inflexibility, as do most bureaucratic regulations. </p><p>Trump\u2019s proposed order would also set a dangerous precedent. Regulating Big Tech might give conservatives the advantage right now, but it would come back to bite them later on \u2014 because as soon as Trump signs that order, he is giving future presidents, Democratic or Republican, the ability to regulate these platforms as they see fit. And it\u2019s only a matter of time before a Democratic president decides that Big Tech is showing too much favor to conservatives. </p><p>There are better solutions to the Big Tech problem. One would be allowing the free market to regulate these platforms, which Jed Rubenfeld explains here. Another would be introducing digital licenses for internet-based companies that would vary based on the size and scope of the company in question \u2014 an option Steven Hill explains at length here. </p><p>What is clear is that neither of these options should come from the White House. This is the responsibility of Congress since the crux of the complaint lies with Section 230 \u2014 a law written and passed by Congress, which must, therefore, be changed by Congress. </p><p>Several Republican lawmakers have already proposed their own Section 230 revisions. Trump needs to let them take the lead, rather than signing an executive order out of personal frustration. Because if Trump continues down this road, he might just end up opening a Pandora\u2019s box that we\u2019ll never be able to close.</p><p>Photo Caption:President Donald Trump's Twitter feed is photographed on an Apple iPad in New York, Thursday, June 27, 2019.

We have Barack Obama\u2019s government-centric, high-tax-and-regulations, government-money-\u201cStimulus,\u201d Socialism model.  And we have Donald Trump\u2019s private-sector-centric, low-tax-and-regulations, \u201cLet the producers keep their coin and keep producing,\u201d Capitalism model.  The numbers are in \u2013 and they ain\u2019t great for Obama and the Democrats\u2019 Socialism.  Shocker, I know. </p><p> We only had a preceding century\u2019s worth of Socialism failure visual aides at which to look.  It\u2019s really surprising Obama\u2019s redux \u2013 failed just as utterly.  Just about the first thing Obama did \u2013 was sign an $878 billion \u201cStimulus\u201d bill.  Passed to have the government massively spend \u2013 to allegedly stimulate private sector growth.  Meaning government took nearly a trillion dollars of additional money away from productive people.  Thereby handing it to the world\u2019s least productive people \u2013 government bureaucrats.  By the way: That additional trillion-dollar-per-annum in spending \u2013 was then built into the annual federal government budget.  Because Congress for years stopped passing budgets \u2013 we operated on serial Continuing Resolutions (CRs).  Which inherently built-in the new additional spending \u2013 in perpetuity.  So we really have now had almost TEN TRILLION DOLLARS in government \u201cStimulus\u201d spending.  Hooray.  Obama also signed massive-government-expanding Obamacare.  Obama also dramatically increased regulations of all sorts \u2013 on everything.  When he left office, the cost for the private sector to comply with just federal regs \u2013 was TWO TRILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR.  Obama\u2019s economic results \u2013 stunk on ice.  Obama never, ever had a year of at least 2% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth \u2013 the first president in our history to achieve such ignominy.  A pathetic paltriness Obama said was \u201cThe new normal.\u201d  And Obamacare, on average, doubled health insurance premiums and tripled deductibles for about one hundred million Americans \u2013 and threw our entire system into chaos.  Obama\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s have government do more\u201d approach \u2013 was an epic failure.  Enter Trump.  Trump immediately began slashing regulations \u2013 at a tremendous pace.  He hasn\u2019t stopped yet.  Trump and Congressional Republicans cut taxes \u2013 the antithesis of the Obama-Democrat \u201cStimulus.\u201d  Rather than government spending more of the money our producers produced \u2013 the tax cut allowed the producers to keep more of their production.  So they can continue to more productively produce.  And while Trump and the Republicans failed to fully repeal Obamacare \u2013 they have removed devastating components of its heinousness.  Trump\u2019s economic results are in \u2013 and they have been extraordinary and fantastic.  Since Trump became president, America has added 7,000,000 new gigs.  Consumer confidence is at decades-old-highs.  Wages are FINALLY increasing substantially \u2013 for the first time in nearly half a century.  In part because of a dramatically better jobs market \u2013 in part because Trump is working seriously towards ending the open-borders-flood of Third World wage and job competitors into the country.  Trump\u2019s strategic tariffs \u2013 are quickly netting MUCH better trade deals with nations the world over.  One result: Jobs considered \u201cgone forever\u201d \u2013 are returning by the millions.  Obama asked if Trump had a \u201cmagic wand\u201d to bring back those jobs.  No wand necessary \u2013 simply a move to get the government back into the America First business.  The stock market set hundreds of new record highs.  Recently receding only because the Federal Reserve has (finally, properly) started raising interest rates.  Low rates had caused money to pour into the market \u2013 because it couldn\u2019t make more money anywhere else.  Money is now leaving Wall Street \u2013 because it finds a MUCH more attractive Main Street in which to invest.  The last two GDP-growth quarters have been 4.2% and 3.5% \u2013 and we\u2019re looking at a prospective 4.0% year.  More than double Obama\u2019s best \u201cnew normal\u201d year.  Oh: And the tax cuts \u2013 aren\u2019t responsible for the continued ridiculous deficits.  Federal revenue is up 9% this year over last.  The problem is \u2013 federal spending is up even more than that.  We haven\u2019t yet caught up to the built-in \u201cStimulus\u201d \u2013 plus all the other additional spending we\u2019ve piled on top.  Yet again: It ain\u2019t a revenue problem \u2013 it\u2019s a spending problem.  And this past year \u2013 we had the first drop in Obamacare premiums EVER.  Trump\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s have government do less\u201d approach \u2013 has already proven to be a roaring success.  We need to apply this less government approach \u2013 to EVERYTHING.  To wit: The Internet.  The private sector has in the last quarter century invested more than one trillion dollars building out the infrastructure that makes the Internet possible.  Which is why it has grown faster \u2013 than anything ever in the history of humanity.  And become a free speech-free market Xanadu.  (That is, until Big Tech started its Leftist mass censoring.)  The private sector made the Internet happen \u2013 because the federal government wisely left the Internet virtually regulation-free.  Obama at the end of his awful administration \u2013 imposed a massive regulatory regime.  Ridiculously misnamed Network Neutrality.  Which Trump has already, thankfully dumped.  City and municipal governments have all along the way been a massive impediment to additional Internet growth.  They view Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as cash registers.  Charging them huge fees and extorting huge bribes \u2013 in exchange for granting permission to ISPs to provide We the Constituents Internet.  About half of the trillion dollars ISPs invested in the Internet \u2013 didn\u2019t actually go to the Internet.  It instead was skimmed by local governments.  Trump has now fixed that \u2013 capping the ISP shakedowns in which local governments can engage.  Of course, the local governments are suing to undo that.  Here\u2019s hoping Trump\u2019s less-government common-sense prevails in court.  Because: The World Wide Web \u2013 is the WORLD Wide Web.  Thus, the federal government should be setting policy for the US \u2013 and then negotiating interaction terms with the nations of the world.  You can\u2019t have fifty individual states \u2013 and thousands of municipalities \u2013 imposing thousands of different regulatory regimes.  It\u2019s a blatant violation of the Constitution\u2019s Interstate Commerce Clause \u2013 and would royally screw up the Internet.  Also, government at all levels has for almost two decades been spending government \u201cstimulus\u201d money \u2013 trying to get the government into the ISP business.  Get that?  Governments skim half a trillion dollars from ISP investment in bribes and fees.  Governments tax the living daylight out of ISPs.  And then use the ISPs\u2019 money \u2013 to create government competitors to ISPs.  Which is really, extraordinarily lame.  It\u2019s also really stupid.  Government Internet has failed everywhere it\u2019s been tried \u2013 over, and over, and over, and over again.  Because government \u201cstimulus\u201d of all sorts has failed \u2013 over, and over, and over, and over again.  Because that\u2019s the way the world works.  Human nature \u2013 is human nature.  Heck, Obama\u2019s $878 billion \u201cStimulus\u201d \u2013 had $7.2 billion dedicated to government Internet.  Guess what?  It all stunk on ice too.  So we need the Trump less government approach \u2013 applied everywhere.  Including \u2013 especially \u2013 to the Internet.  No Net Neutrality.  From any governments anywhere.  No new regs of any other kind.  From any government anywhere.  No new taxes.  And no more \u201cstimuluses.\u201d  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN983651120181112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR0-19H1-J9XT-P2TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1297\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 12, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

approach policy - so as to elicit private sector growth.<br/>We have Barack Obama's government-centric, high-tax-and-regulations, government-money-\"Stimulus,\" Socialism model.<br/>And we have Donald Trump's private-sector-centric, low-tax-and-regulations, \"Let the producers keep their coin and keep producing,\" Capitalism model.</p><p><br/>The numbers are in - and they ain't great for Obama and the Democrats' Socialism.\u00a0 Shocker, I know.<br/>We only had a preceding century's worth of Socialism failure visual aides at which to look.\u00a0 It's really surprising Obama's redux - failed just as utterly.<br/>Just about the first thing Obama did - was sign an $878 billion \"Stimulus\" bill.\u00a0 Passed to have the government massively spend - to allegedly stimulate private sector growth.<br/>Meaning government took nearly a trillion dollars of additional money away from productive people.\u00a0 Thereby handing it to the world's least productive people - government bureaucrats.<br/>By the way: That additional trillion-dollar-per-annum in spending - was then built into the annual federal government budget.\u00a0 Because Congress for years stopped passing budgets - we operated on serial Continuing Resolutions (CRs).\u00a0 Which inherently built-in the new additional spending - in perpetuity.<br/>So we really have now had almost TEN TRILLION DOLLARS in government \"Stimulus\" spending.\u00a0 Hooray.<br/>Obama also signed massive-government-expanding Obamacare.<br/>Obama also dramatically increased regulations of all sorts - on everything.\u00a0 When he left office, the cost for the private sector to comply with just federal regs - was TWO TRILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR.<br/>Obama's economic results - stunk on ice.<br/>Obama never, ever had a year of at least 2% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth - the first president in our history to achieve such ignominy.\u00a0 A pathetic paltriness Obama said was \"The new normal.\"<br/>And Obamacare, on average, doubled health insurance premiums and tripled deductibles for about one hundred million Americans - and threw our entire system into chaos.<br/>Obama's \"Let's have government do more\" approach - was an epic failure.<br/>Enter Trump.<br/>Trump immediately began slashing regulations - at a tremendous pace.\u00a0 He hasn't stopped yet.<br/>Trump and Congressional Republicans cut taxes - the antithesis of the Obama-Democrat \"Stimulus.\"\u00a0 Rather than government spending more of the money our producers produced - the tax cut allowed the producers to keep more of their production.\u00a0 So they can continue to more productively produce.<br/>And while Trump and the Republicans failed to fully repeal Obamacare - they have removed devastating components of its heinousness.<br/>Trump's economic results are in - and they have been extraordinary and fantastic.<br/>Since Trump became president, America has added 7,000,000 new gigs.\u00a0 Consumer confidence is at decades-old-highs.<br/>Wages are FINALLY increasing substantially - for the first time in nearly half a century.\u00a0 In part because of a dramatically better jobs market - in part because Trump is working seriously towards ending the open-borders-flood of Third World wage and job competitors into the country.<br/>Trump's strategic tariffs - are quickly netting MUCH better trade deals with nations the world over.\u00a0 One result: Jobs considered \"gone forever\" - are returning by the millions.\u00a0 Obama asked if Trump had a \"magic wand\" to bring back those jobs.\u00a0 No wand necessary - simply a move to get the government back into the America First business.<br/>The stock market set hundreds of new record highs.\u00a0 Recently receding only because the Federal Reserve has (finally, properly) started raising interest rates.\u00a0 Low rates had caused money to pour into the market - because it couldn't make more money anywhere else.\u00a0 Money is now leaving Wall Street - because it finds a MUCH more attractive Main Street in which to invest.<br/>The last two GDP-growth quarters have been 4.2% and 3.5% - and we're looking at a prospective 4.0% year.\u00a0 More than double Obama's best \"new normal\" year.<br/>Oh: And the tax cuts - aren't responsible for the continued ridiculous deficits.\u00a0 Federal revenue is up 9% this year over last.\u00a0 The problem is - federal spending is up even more than that.\u00a0 We haven't yet caught up to the built-in \"Stimulus\" - plus all the other additional spending we've piled on top.<br/>Yet again: It ain't a revenue problem - it's a spending problem.<br/>And this past year - we had the first drop in Obamacare premiums EVER.<br/>Trump's \"Let's have government do less\" approach - has already proven to be a roaring success.<br/>We need to apply this less government approach - to EVERYTHING.<br/>To wit: The Internet.<br/>The private sector has in the last quarter century invested more than one trillion dollars building out the infrastructure that makes the Internet possible.<br/>Which is why it has grown faster - than anything ever in the history of humanity.\u00a0 And become a free speech-free market Xanadu.\u00a0 (That is, until Big Tech started its Leftist mass censoring.)<br/>The private sector made the Internet happen - because the federal government wisely left the Internet virtually regulation-free.<br/>Obama at the end of his awful administration - imposed a massive regulatory regime.\u00a0 Ridiculously misnamed Network Neutrality.\u00a0 Which Trump has already, thankfully dumped.<br/>City and municipal governments have all along the way been a massive impediment to additional Internet growth.\u00a0 They view Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as cash registers.\u00a0 Charging them huge fees and extorting huge bribes - in exchange for granting permission to ISPs to provide We the Constituents Internet.<br/>About half of the trillion dollars ISPs invested in the Internet - didn't actually go to the Internet.\u00a0 It instead was skimmed by local governments.<br/>Trump has now fixed that - capping the ISP shakedowns in which local governments can engage.\u00a0 Of course, the local governments are suing to undo that.\u00a0 Here's hoping Trump's less-government common-sense prevails in court.<br/>Because: The World Wide Web - is the WORLD Wide Web.\u00a0 Thus, the federal government should be setting policy for the US - and then negotiating interaction terms with the nations of the world.<br/>You can't have fifty individual states - and thousands of municipalities - imposing thousands of different regulatory regimes.\u00a0 It's a blatant violation of the Constitution's Interstate Commerce Clause - and would royally screw up the Internet.<br/>Also, government at all levels has for almost two decades been spending government \"stimulus\" money - trying to get the government into the ISP business.<br/>Get that?\u00a0 Governments skim half a trillion dollars from ISP investment in bribes and fees.\u00a0 Governments tax the living daylight out of ISPs.\u00a0 And then use the ISPs' money - to create government competitors to ISPs.\u00a0 Which is really, extraordinarily lame.<br/>It's also really stupid.\u00a0 Government Internet has failed everywhere it's been tried - over, and over, and over, and over again.<br/>Because government \"stimulus\" of all sorts has failed - over, and over, and over, and over again.<br/>Because that's the way the world works.\u00a0 Human nature - is human nature.<br/>Heck, Obama's $878 billion \"Stimulus\" - had $7.2 billion dedicated to government Internet.\u00a0 Guess what?\u00a0 It all stunk on ice too.<br/>So we need the Trump less government approach - applied everywhere.<br/>Including - especially - to the Internet.<br/>No Net Neutrality.\u00a0 From any governments anywhere.<br/>No new regs of any other kind.\u00a0 From any government anywhere.<br/>No new taxes.\u00a0 And no more \"stimuluses.\"<br/>Please.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

We have Barack Obama's government-centric, high-tax-and-regulations, government-money-'Stimulus,' Socialism model. And we have Donald Trump's private-sector-centric, low-tax-and-regulations, 'Let the producers keep their coin and keep producing,' Capitalism model. The numbers are in - and they ain't great for Obama and the Democrats' Socialism. </p><p>Shocker, I know. We only had a preceding century's worth of Socialism failure visual aides at which to look. It's really surprising Obama's redux - failed just as utterly. Just about the first thing Obama did - was sign an $878 billion 'Stimulus' bill. Passed to have the government massively spend - to allegedly stimulate private sector growth. Meaning government took nearly a trillion dollars of additional money away from productive people. Thereby handing it to the world's least productive people - government bureaucrats. By the way: That additional trillion-dollar-per-annum in spending - was then built into the annual federal government budget. Because Congress for years stopped passing budgets - we operated on serial Continuing Resolutions (CRs). Which inherently built-in the new additional spending - in perpetuity. So we really have now had almost TEN TRILLION DOLLARS in government 'Stimulus' spending. Hooray. Obama also signed massive-government-expanding Obamacare. Obama also dramatically increased regulations of all sorts - on everything. When he left office, the cost for the private sector to comply with just federal regs - was TWO TRILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. Obama's economic results - stunk on ice. Obama never, ever had a year of at least 2% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth - the first president in our history to achieve such ignominy. A pathetic paltriness Obama said was 'The new normal.' And Obamacare, on average, doubled health insurance premiums and tripled deductibles for about one hundred million Americans - and threw our entire system into chaos. Obama's 'Let's have government do more' approach - was an epic failure. Enter Trump. Trump immediately began slashing regulations - at a tremendous pace. He hasn't stopped yet. Trump and Congressional Republicans cut taxes - the antithesis of the Obama-Democrat 'Stimulus.' Rather than government spending more of the money our producers produced - the tax cut allowed the producers to keep more of their production. So they can continue to more productively produce. And while Trump and the Republicans failed to fully repeal Obamacare - they have removed devastating components of its heinousness. Trump's economic results are in - and they have been extraordinary and fantastic. Since Trump became president, America has added 7,000,000 new gigs. Consumer confidence is at decades-old-highs. Wages are FINALLY increasing substantially - for the first time in nearly half a century. In part because of a dramatically better jobs market - in part because Trump is working seriously towards ending the open-borders-flood of Third World wage and job competitors into the country. Trump's strategic tariffs - are quickly netting MUCH better trade deals with nations the world over. One result: Jobs considered 'gone forever' - are returning by the millions. Obama asked if Trump had a 'magic wand' to bring back those jobs. No wand necessary - simply a move to get the government back into the America First business. The stock market set hundreds of new record highs. Recently receding only because the Federal Reserve has (finally, properly) started raising interest rates. Low rates had caused money to pour into the market - because it couldn't make more money anywhere else. Money is now leaving Wall Street - because it finds a MUCH more attractive Main Street in which to invest. The last two GDP-growth quarters have been 4.2% and 3.5% - and we're looking at a prospective 4.0% year. More than double Obama's best 'new normal' year. Oh: And the tax cuts - aren't responsible for the continued ridiculous deficits. Federal revenue is up 9% this year over last. The problem is - federal spending is up even more than that. We haven't yet caught up to the built-in 'Stimulus' - plus all the other additional spending we've piled on top. Yet again: It ain't a revenue problem - it's a spending problem. And this past year - we had the first drop in Obamacare premiums EVER. Trump's 'Let's have government do less' approach - has already proven to be a roaring success. We need to apply this less government approach - to EVERYTHING. To wit: The Internet. The private sector has in the last quarter century invested more than one trillion dollars building out the infrastructure that makes the Internet possible. Which is why it has grown faster - than anything ever in the history of humanity. And become a free speech-free market Xanadu. (That is, until Big Tech started its Leftist mass censoring.) The private sector made the Internet happen - because the federal government wisely left the Internet virtually regulation-free. Obama at the end of his awful administration - imposed a massive regulatory regime. Ridiculously misnamed Network Neutrality. Which Trump has already, thankfully dumped. City and municipal governments have all along the way been a massive impediment to additional Internet growth. They view Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as cash registers. Charging them huge fees and extorting huge bribes - in exchange for granting permission to ISPs to provide We the Constituents Internet. About half of the trillion dollars ISPs invested in the Internet - didn't actually go to the Internet. It instead was skimmed by local governments. Trump has now fixed that - capping the ISP shakedowns in which local governments can engage. Of course, the local governments are suing to undo that. Here's hoping Trump's less-government common-sense prevails in court. Because: The World Wide Web - is the WORLD Wide Web. Thus, the federal government should be setting policy for the US - and then negotiating interaction terms with the nations of the world. You can't have fifty individual states - and thousands of municipalities - imposing thousands of different regulatory regimes. It's a blatant violation of the Constitution's Interstate Commerce Clause - and would royally screw up the Internet. Also, government at all levels has for almost two decades been spending government 'stimulus' money - trying to get the government into the ISP business. Get that? Governments skim half a trillion dollars from ISP investment in bribes and fees. Governments tax the living daylight out of ISPs. And then use the ISPs' money - to create government competitors to ISPs. Which is really, extraordinarily lame. It's also really stupid. Government Internet has failed everywhere it's been tried - over, and over, and over, and over again. Because government 'stimulus' of all sorts has failed - over, and over, and over, and over again. Because that's the way the world works. Human nature - is human nature. Heck, Obama's $878 billion 'Stimulus' - had $7.2 billion dedicated to government Internet. Guess what? It all stunk on ice too. So we need the Trump less government approach - applied everywhere. Including - especially - to the Internet. No Net Neutrality. From any governments anywhere. No new regs of any other kind. From any government anywhere. No new taxes. And no more 'stimuluses.' Please.

And this is a  Fox News alert.  I'm Bret Baier, live tonight in Miami. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is telling reporters tonight that  she is now pushing for an independent probe outside of congress to study  the allegations of Russian involvement in the election.  She's also calling  for congressional investigations, but an independent commission called for  by the President, she says, like the 9/11 commission. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meantime more electors, Pelosi's daughter among them, are now calling for  an intelligence briefing on what is known about Russian hacking before  making the electoral vote official on December 19th.  More on all of this  in just a moment.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, today was decision day for President-Elect Donald Trump.  And he  made official what we told you last night.  ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson is  his pick to be America's top diplomat.  Like Trump, Tillerson has never  served in government but has business ties all over the world. </p><p>But it's the Exxon CEO's ties to one particular country that are raising  eyebrows in Washington -- Russia.  Trump's chief of staff calls Tillerson a  diplomat who happens to be able to drill oil. </p><p>Reaction today from Democrats and some Republicans is signaling what could  be a big fight on Capitol Hill come confirmation time. </p><p>Senior national correspondent John Roberts is live tonight in Wisconsin  where President-Elect Trump's thank-you tour resumes in about two hours and  more breaking news from the transition, new picks. </p><p>Good evening -- John.   </p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Bret -- good evening  to you.  We had learned in just the last hour that Donald Trump has made  another decision.  He intends to name Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke as  secretary of the Interior. </p><p>One of the things that Donald Trump really likes about Zinke is his  military record.  He was a member of SEAL Team Six holding the rank of  commander.  All in all, it was another busy day at Trump Tower. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ROBERTS:  Another surprise appearance by Donald Trump in the lobby of Trump  Tower today, after a meeting with his old friend, Kanye West.   </p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  He's a good man.   </p><p>ROBERTS:  Later a visit from Microsoft founder Bill Gates ahead of  tomorrow's big tech summit.  But the headline today was Trump's outside- the-box pick for secretary of State, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson.   </p><p>MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We just couldn't be more grateful  that someone of Rex Tillerson's proven leadership and accomplishments has  been willing to step forward to serve our nation as our next secretary of  State.   </p><p>ROBERTS:  While some members of congress including Republican Marco Rubio  had concerns about Tillerson's deep ties to Russia, Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell today offered his full support. </p><p>Robert Gates who served as secretary of Defense under Presidents Bush and  Obama today said of Tillerson quote, \"He would bring to the position vast  knowledge, experience and success in dealing with dozens of governments and  leaders in every corner of the world.\" </p><p>Bush secretary of State Condoleezza Rice added that Tillerson, quote, \"will  represent the interests and the values of the United States with resolve  and commitment.\" </p><p>And former Vice President Dick Cheney said Tillerson has, quote, \"the  ability and judgment to deal with the very dangerous world we find  confronting us.\" </p><p>Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus today defended Tillerson's  relationship with Vladimir Putin.   </p><p>REINCE PRIEBUS, TRUMP CHIEF OF STAFF:  The truth is that having  relationships with people is not a bad thing.  I mean we have a lot of  problems in this world and we're not going solve those problems by making  believe that people don't exist.   </p><p>ROBERTS:  With only four cabinet positions left, Fox News has learned that  Trump has decided on former Texas Governor Rick Perry to be his Energy  secretary.  In the height of irony, energy is one of three departments  Perry pledged to eliminate when he ran for president last cycle and the one  he couldn't remember in a debate that torpedoed his candidacy.   </p><p>RICK PERRY (R), FORMER GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:  And let's see -- I can't, the  third one, I can't.  Sorry.  Oops.   </p><p>ROBERTS:  The nation will have to wait a while longer to find out how  Donald Trump will separate himself from his vast business empire.  A press  conference set for Thursday has now been pushed back to early January. </p><p>Transition sources say Trump's team bit off more than it could chew filling  all the cabinet positions and just couldn't get the business plan in place  in time.   </p><p>PRIEBUS:  What President-Elect Trump is doing with a lot of lawyers and a  lot of people involved is just making sure that all government ethics are  followed, that the is are dotted and the ts are crossed and he's going to  make sure that nothing is compromised.   </p><p>ROBERTS:  On Twitter last night, Trump did give some hints of his plans.   Pledging to leave his businesses by January 20th and turn them over to sons  Eric and Don Jr. to manage with the condition that they make no new deals  during his presidency. </p><p>The plan would appear to have Trump stay as an owner and free up daughter,  Ivanka, to possibly take a position in his administration. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ROBERTS:  By postponing that press conference until January, Trump derives  two benefits.  First of all it gives him more time to get his plan in place  and second it avoids answering any difficult questions about his finances,  his businesses or the CIA claim that Russian hackers are trying to help him  become president before the electors vote, and that will happen on December  19th next Tuesday -- Bret. </p><p>BAIER:  John Roberts, live in Wisconsin.  John -- thank you.   </p><p>We told you at the top of the program, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  wants an independent probe of alleged Russian involvement in last month's  election.  But not everybody in the spy business sees Russia's digital  fingerprints on the outcome.  Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine  Herridge sorts it all out for us tonight.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  A U.S.  government source says the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper  who oversees the 17 intelligence agencies is not on the same page as CIA  director John Brennan.  The issue comes down to the hackers' intent, and  whether there is strong evidence that Vladimir Putin's government meddled  to ensure a Trump victory. </p><p>The White House spokesman said today Mr. Obama wants a formal assessment  public.   </p><p>JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  That's something that we'll try  to do.  The President does believe that we should, particularly when it  relates to something as central to our democracy as the conduct of a  national election.   </p><p>HERRIDGE:  The timing and targets of the cyber attacks varied widely.  The  hacks exposed via WikiLeaks e-mails belonging to the Clinton campaign team  and the DNC.  Another wave of attacks hit voter registration data from  state boards of elections.   </p><p>JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  We gave considerable  thought to timing out Russia with that statement.   </p><p>HERRIDGE:  DNI Clapper told lawmakers last month that after the U.S.  government publicly blamed Russia, the attacks against the state boards  dropped off.   </p><p>CLAPPER:  I was referring to the cyber reconnaissance that we had observed.   </p><p>HERRIDGE:  Clapper said the Russian link to WikiLeaks and the Clinton  campaign e-mails was more tenuous, when pressed by the committee's senior  Democrat.   </p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  I want to drill down a little further  into your comment that the Russian activity curtailed after the issuance of  the statement.  The dumping of documents didn't end.   </p><p>CLAPPER:  As far as the WikiLeaks connection, the evidence there is not  strong and we don't have good insight into the sequencing of the releases  or when the data may have been provided.   </p><p>HERRIDGE:  In a letter Monday, the Republican chairman of the House  Committee, Devin Nunes, asked Clapper to reconcile by Friday media reports  that the CIA and FBI have developed conflicting intelligence assessments.   A former intelligence officer said discerning Russia's motivation would be  challenging.   </p><p>LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  For e-mail traffic and  signals intelligence, you see patterns.  What you need to define and find  out intent is someone on the inside.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>HERRIDGE:  And late today the House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for  the creation of an independent probe along the lines of the 9/11 Commission  that investigated the 2001 terrorist attacks.  Pelosi also supports a  separate congressional investigation and insisted to reporters tonight that  her position would be exactly the same if Clinton had won in November --  Bret.   </p><p>BAIER:  More on this with the panel.   </p><p>Catherine -- thank you. </p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome. </p><p>BAIER:  The alleged interference by Russia is also prompting some of the  people who actually elect the president to ask for more information. </p><p>Chief Washington correspondent James Rosen has that part of the story  tonight.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  George W. Bush of the  state of Texas has received for president of the United States 271 votes.   </p><p>JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And with that, Vice  President Al Gore, Democratic nominee and winner of the popular vote in  2000, serving as president of the Senate, certified that the Electoral  College had awarded the presidency to Republican nominee, George W. Bush. </p><p>Now the never-Trumpers -- remember them -- see the Electoral College which  Donald Trump also won without capturing the popular vote as the final arena  for blocking the President-Elect from taking the oath.  30 members of the  Electoral College including one Republican citing the conclusion of the  Central Intelligence Agency that Russia actively interfered to sway the  outcome of the election have written to Director of National Intelligence  General James Clapper seeking a briefing on the underlying intelligence  before the electors cast their votes December 19th.  And leading the charge  is a California elector who is the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy  Pelosi.   </p><p>CHRISTINE PELOSI, CALIFORNIA ELECTOR:  Our independent elections ought to  be what define us as a country.  And so if there is evidence that not only  was the election tainted but that one of the candidates knew about that and  profited from it, then that certainly is something that the electors should  know in advance.   </p><p>ROSEN:  Supporting the request is the chairman of Hillary Clinton's  campaign, John Podesta, the very person whose e-mail account posted online  by WikiLeaks is said by CIA to have been hacked with Russian complicity. </p><p>The White House, however, stopped short of endorsing the request, indeed,  pointed out a big hurdle to granting it.   </p><p>EARNEST:  Look, I know that, you know, some of the requests was for  classified information and it's not clear that all of the electors, and I'm  sure most of them don't, don't have security clearances.   </p><p>ROSEN:  The President-Elect told \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" that Democrats are  peddling the account of Russian meddling, because, quote, they suffered one  of the greatest defeats in the history of American politics.   </p><p>TRUMP:  It's ridiculous.  We ought to get back to making America great  again which is what we're going to do and we've already started the  process.   </p><p>ROSEN:  As the Electoral College vote approaches, some Trump electors have  reported being on the receiving end of hate mail and worse.   </p><p>MICHAEL, MICHIGAN ELECTOR:  Unfortunately, I've received a couple of death  threats, some death wishes and just some angry messages from people who are  disappointed in the election results.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ROSEN:  A source at the Republican National Committee told me that what  concern exists over this play for the Electoral College is tied not to  defections but to resignations.  Not all states have replacement mechanisms  in place -- Bret. </p><p>BAIER:  All right, James.  Thank you.   </p><p>Now that the President-Elect has selected three more cabinet members, there  is one unofficial position to talk about tonight.  Maybe it can be called  ambassador to the left. </p><p>National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports it appears one of  the first daughters-to-be may already have the job.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  She's the  executive vice president of the Trump Organization, a former model, and  mother of three.  And she may just be her father's secret weapon, serving  as a bridge to the left.  A lifestyle guru who's built a business in her  own right, Ivanka Trump has pushed her father on the environment and  women's health issues.   </p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF DONALD TRUMP:  Equality, childcare -- these are  things that are very important for me.   </p><p>GRIFFIN:  She helped soften her father's image in the wake of the \"Access:  Hollywood\" audiotape starring in this campaign ad called \"Motherhood\".  </p><p>I. TRUMP:  He will provide tax credits for childcare.   </p><p>GRIFFIN:  Ivanka helped insert language into her father's platform that  would appeal to your average Democrat.  In fact, she and her brothers  couldn't vote for their father in the New York primary because they were  still registered Democrats.   </p><p>I. TRUMP:  Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it  a practice at his company throughout his entire career.   </p><p>GRIFFIN:  In recent weeks, Ivanka has arranged for her father to meet with  former Vice President Al Gore, to hear his views on global warming -- a  move that took environmentalists by surprise.  She's met twice with  Leonardo DiCaprio to talk about the environment.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It looks a little bit like a head fake when you have  her meet with Al Gore one day and then the next day Donald Trump turns  around and picks for EPA someone who hasn't always said that he believes  that climate change is real.   </p><p>Reporter:  Ivanka and husband, Jared Kushner, traveled to Washington, D.C.,  on Sunday and dined at their family hotel with Senate Majority leader Mitch  McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, Trump's pick for Transportation  secretary.  They also may have been house hunting. </p><p>Longtime political producer and Washington host, Tammy Haddad, said  Democrats would be wise to embrace Ivanka.   </p><p>TAMMY HADDAD, POLITICAL PRODUCER:  I don't know if Ivanka Trump can change  anyone's mind.  I don't know if the Democrats will listen to him.  I don't  know if people in Washington who were against him will now come into the  tent.  What I do know is that Ivanka Trump has the biggest opportunity to  bring the most people in.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>GRIFFIN:  Once friends with Chelsea Clinton, Ivanka reportedly was the one  her father handed the phone to when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  called him after the election to talk about women's health care.  As first  daughter, she may be one of her father's most important ambassadors --  Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Jennifer -- thank you.   </p><p>Stocks were up today.  The Dow gained 115 for another record close, closing  just shy of 20,000.  The S&amp;P 500 finished ahead 15.  The Nasdaq surged 51. </p><p>Let's get some analysis of the markets tonight.  Fox Business Network's  Trish Regan is in New York.  Good evening -- Trish.  89 points until 20k --  we think it happens this week.  What is behind all this momentum?   </p><p>TRISH REGAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I think it very well could.  I  mean there was a good shot of it happening today.  At one point we were  really within that 50-point range of hitting 20,000.  But I think it could  happen as soon as tomorrow, certainly sometime this week and certainly  before the end of the year. </p><p>Traders are banking on this.  There's a lot of momentum right now and it's  hard to stop.  There's an expectation that there will be lower taxes, that  there will be less regulation and these are things that are just music to  businesses' ears and it's one of the reasons why you're seeing all this  upside right now -- Bret.   </p><p>BAIER:  You know, we often talk, Trish, about the Fed and the Federal  Reserve announces its decision on interest rates tomorrow.  Most are  expecting a bump in interest rates by a quarter of a point.  What else are  they watching out for with the Fed?   </p><p>REGAN:  Well, they want to see what exactly the Fed says in terms of its  tone for the future because the question is, all right, you may get that  quarter-point hike, but are you going to get another one at the next Fed  meeting?  Does the Fed actually think the economy is gaining enough  strength that it can move forward with this interest rate rising policy,  you know, one after another in each meeting?  Or are they going to sort of  space these out?  So they'll be looking to find out what the pace of the  increase for these interest rate hikes actually will be. </p><p>There's also some questions about whether or not the market can sustain  these kind of levels once interest rates move higher.  So that will be very  critical to watch the market tomorrow, to see how traders react to this  expectation of the quarter point hike. </p><p>And we'll also be watching very carefully to see if Janet Yellen, head of  the Federal Reserve, says anything about Donald Trump and how she thinks  the economy might fare under him.  She obviously doesn't want to get too  political, the Fed never does.  Nut these are the things that traders will  be looking to hear.   </p><p>BAIER:  Trish, as always -- thank you.  We'll be watching you on FBN  tomorrow for all that breaking news.   </p><p>Pro-immigration forces have come up with a new way to fight Donald Trump  over his stated plans to deport illegal immigrants with criminal records. </p><p>Correspondent Claudia Cowan reports tonight from San Francisco.  It  involves making you pay to fight the feds -- Claudia. </p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, San Francisco is doubling  down on its so-called sanctuary city status by considering a $5 million  plan to hire more lawyers to defend illegal immigrants facing deportation  including those who've been arrested for committing other crimes in this  country. </p><p>At a recent rally here on the steps of San Francisco's city hall former  detainees said their lack of access to an immigration lawyer turned their  lives upside-down.  And they're worried about President-Elect Donald  Trump's idea to deport millions of illegal immigrants -- a plan Trump has  since tempered. </p><p>But county supervisor David Campos introduced the legislation arguing  everyone deserves the same access to public resources and he defends this  use of tax dollars.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID CAMPOS, SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISOR:  We're going to invest the  resources needed to make sure that the 44,000 undocumented people who live  in the city and county of San Francisco have at a minimum legal  representation if they're taken into immigration court.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>COWAN:  But the move faces opposition even inside city hall.  Mayor Ed Lee,  a staunch supporter of policies friendly to illegal immigrants, says he's  concerned about some of the funding aspects of this legislation, while  critics of the whole idea contend moves like this continue to encourage  illegal immigration.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RICK OLTMAN, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ACTIVIST:  What we need to be sending is a  message around the world, a message of discouragement to reduce the flow to  our border.  That will make securing the border easier.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>COWAN:  But in the wake of the election other cities including New York and  Chicago are also looking to set aside millions of dollars to hire lawyers  to help fight deportations.  But eventually city officials may also have to  consider which city programs will have to go because President-Elect Trump  has also vowed to cut federal funding to these so-called sanctuary cities  and here in San Francisco that could total more than $1 billion a year --  Bret. </p><p>BAIER:  Claudia -- thank you.   </p><p>Up next, what will President-Elect Donald Trump do in his first 100 days in  office about energy and infrastructure?  Some big changes could be afoot.   Stay tuned. </p><p>Back live in Miami tonight after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BAIER:  Welcome back to Miami. </p><p>Tonight's installment of our series on the first 100 days of the Trump  administration focuses on energy and infrastructure.  Donald Trump's  election is providing hope to areas of the country that have lost much of  their way of life because of changing attitudes about coal and green  energy. </p><p>National correspondent William La Jeunesse takes us to one of those places  tonight.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fire.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just the coal itself, it's the downstream value to our  economy, to our people, to our community.   </p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hotchkiss, Colorado  calls itself the friendliest town around.  It's anything but for the coal  industry. </p><p>In this area of Western Colorado there were three coal mines, now there's  only one.  But coal isn't the only casualty.  You're also killing a  community. </p><p>MAYOR WENDELL KOONTZ, HOTCHKISS, COLORADO:  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, this  is empty.   </p><p>Yes, this used to be a quilt store.   </p><p>This is Pastime Friendly Tavern.  It closed just this year.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Mayor Wendell Koontz saw 1,200 jobs disappear in one year.   </p><p>KOONTZ:  For every one job at the mine they estimate there's five to seven  jobs down valley.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Coal provided 50 percent of U.S. electricity eight years ago  -- today, 31 percent and falling. </p><p>Is it market driven?  Is it politics?  What does Donald Trump represent in  that equation?   </p><p>KOONTZ:  It's probably a little bit of both.  The shutdown of a lot of the  coal-fired plants and the loss of market is due to regulations that have  restricted emissions from coal-fired plants.  So it is a combination of  that and cheap natural gas.   </p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to save that coal industry, believe me.  We're going to  save it.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  President Trump promised to cut coal regulations including  the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement which dramatically restrict  U.S. carbon emissions.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's tough on the communities.  It's tough on the  people at the mine, you know.  You have friends that you worked with for  years that are no longer there.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They don't know what to do.  I mean, this is their  livelihood.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Think about it, when you're 40, 50 years old, what do  you do?  Do you go back to college and say, ok, what do I want to be when I  grow up?   </p><p>TRUMP:  Under my presidency, we'll accomplish a complete American energy  independence.  Complete.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  To do that, Trump promises to open federal lands to oil and  gas drilling and lift the effective ban on offshore drilling outside the  Gulf of Mexico.   </p><p>ROB BISHOP (R-UT), HOUSE NATURAL RESOURCES CHAIRMAN:  I am excited and I am  nervous at the same time because it's not going to be as easy as some  people think.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Why?  Because Congressman Rob Bishop says opponents can still  use the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Protection  Act to stop energy development.   </p><p>BISHOP:  The goal is to have abundant, affordable energy.  That makes our  economy grow.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  That includes alternative energy.  Though Trump criticized  wind and solar in the campaign, renewables now provide more than 30 percent  of the power in ten states.   </p><p>STEVE LOCKHARD, TPI COMPOSITES CEO:  The cost of wind has come down 61  percent in the last 6 years.  It's equal to or better than low cost natural  gas in the U.S.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Steve Lockhart's company makes wind turbine blades in Iowa.   </p><p>LOCKHARD:  We contribute $50 million a year just in payroll and direct  benefits to our employees.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Because 600,000 now work in wind and solar, most expect Trump  won't cut the production tax credit.  His infrastructure plan also  modernizes the power grid while support for the North Dakota Access and  Keystone Pipelines would move oil more cheaply.   </p><p>HERB MORGAN, FLUOR CORP SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT:  Looking at the President's  trillion dollars over ten years from a Fluor perspective, we think that's,  you know, a wonderful thing.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Business and labor support his infrastructure plan.  The  challenge is building big projects without producing big deficits.   </p><p>TRUMP:  It will be deficit neutral.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Trump would essentially replace federal subsidies with tax  breaks to induce private companies to invest their money.   </p><p>MORGAN:  We had about 1,400 craft work on this job.  That translated into  another 7,500 jobs.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  In other projects, say road and rail, government can reduce  its upfront cost by spreading the risks and sharing the reward or revenue  stream.  In this case -- from tolls, ticket sales or fees.   </p><p>TRUMP:  This is your treasure and you, the American people, are entitled to  share in the riches.   </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Trump hopes to leverage federal money and tax policy to  induce investment.  But ultimately projects and industries live or die only  if they make money. </p><p>In Hotchkiss, Colorado -- William La Jeunesse, Fox News.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BAIER:  Our 15-part series looking ahead to the first 100 days of the Trump  presidency continues tomorrow with a look at the fate of the Iran nuclear  deal.   </p><p>A lot of news on the abortion front tonight.  Ohio Republican Governor John  Kasich has signed a bill imposing a 20-week abortion ban.  Kasich vetoed a  separate measure that would have barred abortions at the first detectable  fetal heartbeat. </p><p>The Oklahoma Supreme Court has thrown out a law requiring doctors at  clinics to have hospital admitting privileges.  That ruling overturns a  lower court decision. </p><p>And here in Florida a federal judge is being asked to block additional  parts of this state's contentious abortion law over constitutional rights  issues.  The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Florida, filed a  lawsuit late yesterdays on behalf of several ministers, rabbis and  organizations that provide abortion counseling services to women.   </p><p>Tonight, we bring you an exclusive first look at some shocking information  about just how dangerous some abortion clinics are in this country. </p><p>Chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream tells us the information comes as  President-Elect Donald Trump considers his policy on abortion funding.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT:  A brand new report by  the pro-life legal advocacy group, Americans United for Life, tracks  hundreds of abortion clinics in 32 states, compiling more than 1,400 health  and safety violations since 2008. </p><p>Calling it the evidence the Supreme Court needs to see, following the  justices' decision to strike down Texas clinic regulations earlier this  year.   </p><p>CLARKE FORSYTHE, AMERICANS UNITED FOR LIFE:  This report is a rebuke to the  Supreme Court's tragic decision in June in the Texas abortion case where  the court threw out health and safety standards for Texas abortion clinics  saying that we need more proof.  Well here's the proof. </p><p>BREAM:  The report and accompanying videos entitled \"Unsafe\" come at the  same time the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute is publishing its own  warnings, highlighting concerns about access and funding for abortions.  In  the report's section entitled \"Patient safeguards\", Guttmacher focuses on  doing away with barriers or delays, not clinic regulations or protocols. </p><p>Guttmacher's concerns are shared by other pro-choice groups but fear what a  Trump administration may mean including Planned Parenthood which receives  roughly half a billion dollars in government funding each year.   </p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  Should American taxpayers though pay $500  billion to that organization?   </p><p>TRUMP:  No, I said to fund, I didn't say pay.  I said I have a lot of  respect for some of the things they do -- the cervical cancer on women --  they do many, many goods things.  I know many women --  </p><p>HANNITY:  No taxpayer money.   </p><p>TRUMP:  No.  Not while they do abortions.  I made that clear.   </p><p>BREAM:  In a fund-raising e-mail today, Planned Parenthood warned, quote,  \"We're just weeks away from a frightening unprecedented moment\" adding that  Trump will bring, quote, \"some of the worst threats to reproductive rights  and health care we've ever faced\".  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BREAM:  While it would take time and cooperation on Capitol Hill for  President-Elect Trump to make good on his pledge to defund Planned  Parenthood, it's his upcoming Supreme Court nomination that has pro-choice  groups most worried and pro-life groups who supported him watching very  closely -- Bret. </p><p>BAIER:  Shannon -- thank you.   </p><p>The U.S. is stopping some sales of military arms to Saudi Arabia over  concerns about the killing of civilians in Yemen.  The White House ordered  a review in October following the bombing of a funeral home in Yemen that  killed more than 140 people.  Fox News is told the sale involved so-called  smart bombs to the Saudis.  The cancelation does not affect last week's  sale of ch-47 Chinook helicopters valued at nearly $3.5 billion. </p><p>Meantime, however, on Sunday, Iran signed a $16 billion deal for 80  nonmilitary Boeing aircraft -- the largest American deal with Iran in  nearly 40 years.   </p><p>Iran -- a country that U.S. officials say has killed hundreds of Americans  and still funds terrorists around the Middle East.  In fact, today Iran's  president met with the head of the Palestinian Islamic jihad, a group  designated by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist organization.   </p><p>Syrian rebels say an agreement has been reached with Russia for a ceasefire  in Aleppo to evacuate remaining civilians and rebels from besieged  districts there.  They say the ceasefire went into effect a few hours ago.   Yesterday, pro-government forces said they controlled 99 percent of eastern  Aleppo.   </p><p>There is an amazing new potential threat to your privacy coming out of  Russia tonight and it has nothing to do with hacking elections.  Instead  it's all about something intensely personal -- your face.  Senior foreign  affairs correspondent Amy Kellogg explains.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>AMY KELLOGG, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  It's a face recognition app which has  surpassed all others.  It even beat out Google in a mega-face competition  in the U.S.  It was launched earlier this year by two young Russian men.   Here's how FindFace works.  You can snap a picture of someone on the  street, on a bus, and the app will find the person with 70 percent accuracy  if the person has an account on VK, Russia's version of Facebook.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It makes us easier to find someone.  If, for  instance, we are walking around the streets and see a beautiful man or a  handsome man, we can easily take a photo of him and find him and write,  call him, if you wanted.   </p><p>KELLOGG:  The lonely hearts hook is just one way to showcase the  technology.  Law enforcement, casinos, and retail are all knocking on the  company's doors because its special algorithms provide faster and more  user-friendly face recognition than others.   </p><p>ARTEM KUKHARENKO, FINDFACE CO-FOUNDER:  Millions photos, search them in  less than one second, for most of them is like a spaceship, both from  police and private persons, from ordinary people that, for example, in  police, they found a lot of criminals from cold cases.   </p><p>KELLOGG:  Others say this is a huge invasion of privacy.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't like that someone can find me and find  information about me.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>KELLOGG:  FindFace claims that it will be able to match photos with those  who have Twitter accounts any day now, but Twitter is pushing back, saying  it does not have a partnership with the company and considers use of its  data a violation of its rules.  Bret?   </p><p>BAIER:  Interesting.  Amy, thank you.   </p><p>President-elect Trump makes it official.  Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson  will be his nominee for secretary of state.  Reaction is in in Washington.   We'll get reaction from our panel to that and other picks tonight when we  come back.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT:  He's much more than a business  executive.  I mean, he's a world-class player.   </p><p>REINCE PRIEBUS, TRUMP CHIEF OF STAFF:  Rex Tillerson is a really tough guy.   The good lord didn't put oil in all freedom-loving democracies across the  world.   </p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, (R) FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR:  Donald Trump has selected  somebody who knows the world and can advise him on the world.  If you pick  somebody like that, somewhere, someplace, they're going to have some issues  that you're going to have to deal with.   </p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER, (R) TENNESSEE:  Obviously there's been some flirting, if  you will, with Russia that's been a little different than what we're used  to.  Obviously Rex Tillerson will come to these hearings with that  knowledge, and I'm sure will, I hope will do everything he can to allay any  fears that people have.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BAIER:  As we reported last night, Rex Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon Mobil,  is Donald Trump's pick to be the nominee of secretary of state.  He tweeted  out, the president-elect did today, \"The thing I like best about Rex  Tillerson is that he has vast experience in dealing successfully with all  types of foreign governments.\" He's not alone in that.  Former vice  president Dick Cheney releasing a statement saying \"This election of Rex  Tillerson to be secretary of state is an inspired choice.  He has the vast  experience, ability, and judgment to deal with the very dangerous world we  find confronting us.  His extensive knowledge of the global situation will  be an asset in representing our nation.\"  </p><p>But not all Republicans feel that way.  Obviously Democrats have weighed  in, but Marco Rubio, senator from right here in Florida, tweeted out \"Being  a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I am hoping for a secretary of  state.\"  </p><p>With that, let's bring in our panel, I'm in Miami, they're in  Washington, editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham, Anne Gearan,  political correspondent for \"The Washington Post,\" and syndicated columnist  Charles Krauthammer.  Laura, you've listened to the reaction all day to Rex  Tillerson.  Your thoughts on where this is coming down, and is this going  to be a confirmation fight on Capitol Hill?   </p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM:  I'm not sure how much of a  fight it's going to be.  I think it's quite something to hear from Senator  Corker talk about the flirtation between Tillerson and Putin when, first of  all, under the Bush administration, I remember those gauzy pictures  captured with Putin and President Bush at the ranch in cowboy duds, and  looking into his soul and seeing deeply into it.  And of course the failed  Russian reset on behalf of Hillary Clinton's efforts with the former Soviet  Union, and then, of course, Barack Obama's telling Medvedev that he'd have  more flexibility after the 2012 election cycle.  It seems to me there was a  lot of attempts to get closer to Russia in the last two administrations but  not a lot of success in dealing with Russia.   </p><p>So I think it's good to have someone from a different community, the  business community, who's actually been successful in dealing with the  former Soviet Union.  And I think it's refreshing to have someone from his  background and I think it's about time.  We've had a lot of intelligence  and foreign policy failures with the so-called pros in charge.   </p><p>BAIER:  And the Trump transition team is pointing out Tillerson is a tough  negotiator around the world.  He said no numerous times to Vladimir Putin  in tough deals and deal making, he knows world leaders around the world.   But clearly the opposition to Tillerson is pretty fierce on the left, and  it seems like they're going to make at least Tillerson a target in the  confirmation process.   </p><p>ANNE GEARAN, \"WASHINGTON POST\":  Sure.  They're going to try to bloody him  up a little bit.  I mean, as a practical matter, his being somebody that  Democrats don't particularly like or wouldn't be their pick, it is not much  of a concern for a Trump White House as long as they can hold together at  least 50 and probably 51 at least of the Republican votes, they can get him  through.   </p><p>But I'm really interested in how they are -- the Trump team is trying to  turn what seems to be Tillerson's greatest liability, his time on the world  stage in dealing with foreign governments and the kinds of deals he's had  to make to get his business deals done, into an asset, saying that this is  a guy who understands how not only -- not only does he understand  geopolitics and how the world works, but he understands how these leaders  think, and even if we as a country don't agree with those leaders,  understanding their worldview and understanding how they make deals and how  they view the United States from a business perspective is actually an  asset.  That's going to be the chief argument they make on the Hill.   </p><p>BAIER:  Charles, obviously Exxon Mobil one of the biggest if not the  biggest company in the world, and we've talked many times about the  bureaucracy in Washington.  The State Department is a behemoth when it  comes to bureaucracy.  To shake that up, you need somebody perhaps that has  the experience of shaking up companies?   </p><p>CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  I think that's an asset.  His  knowledge of the world is an asset.  To some extent, his relationship with  Putin is an asset if it gives him insight into how to deal with him. </p><p>But, look, the issue is going to be what are his feelings about Putin right  now?  What will they be as a representative not of an oil company that has  interest in the oil in the Russian arctic, but as secretary of state of the  United States?   </p><p>And that's why you have hearings.  They're going to ask him what is your  sense of Putin's motive?  Is he a potential ally?  Is he an adversary?  Is  he somebody who, as it appears to many of us, is intent on diminishing  American influence and expanding Russian fear of influence, particularly in  eastern Europe and the Middle East?   </p><p>But we shouldn't prejudge him until we hear what he has to say.  And the  reason is that he comes in as a man who dealt on behalf of the oil company,  his oil company as a fiduciary.  It reminds me of 1982 when Alexander Hague  stepped down as secretary of state and George Schultz came up.  And he was  the president of Bechtel, an engineering construction around the world,  that had extensive dealings with the Saudis and Gulf Arabs.  It was  suspected that perhaps Schultz had sympathies that would tilt him on the  Arab side of the Arab-Israeli dispute.  It turned out not to be the case at  all and Schultz is one of the great secretaries of state of the second half  of the last century.  So we will see how the man acts and speaks  representing his country and not an oil company.   </p><p>BAIER:  Meantime, Laura, you have pick for secretary of energy, former  Texas governor Rick Perry.  And all day long every cable channel played the  infamous 40-second sound bite from that debate where he can't remember the  third agency, which happens to be energy, that he wants to get rid of in  the GOP primary.  But obviously his career is not judged by a brain freeze  in that debate.  What about Governor Perry for energy?   </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I think Perry is perfectly acceptable and terrific pick.  As  former governor of the state of Texas, we know the job boom that Texas has  been experiencing even with the declining price of oil.  And the industry  there, of course, energy, health care that has shown so much incredible  improvement and growth whereas many sectors of the U.S. economy have really  been lagging behind.   </p><p>Rick Perry was a terrific leader of that state, and his brain freeze at the  debate notwithstanding, I think he's in line with Trump's view we have to  real he move forward to deregulate and remove some of the tangle of the  bureaucracy in the energy sector while, of course, protecting the  environment and doing a good balancing act there, that it's absolutely  incumbent upon the department of energy and this president to make sure we  have good-paying jobs in the United States, which in large part are found  in the energy sector.  So I think it's a terrific pick and I think it's  nice to see all these people who didn't have all that many good words for  Donald Trump getting onboard.  I think it's good stuff.   </p><p>BAIER:  Yes, a cancer of conservatism to a pick in his cabinet.  Anne, and  then Charles, I want it play one more sound bite quickly before we go to  the next panel, and that is different people who showed up at Trump tower  today.  It was quite a mix.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We had a good conversation about innovation, how it can  help in health, education, impact foreign aid and energy.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're not here because of politics.  We are here to  help the president of the United States help his people that need help.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Forget black or white.  Black or white is irrelevant.   The bottom line is job creation, economic development in these urban  neighborhoods.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I just want to take a picture right now.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BAIER:  \"Just want to take a picture.\"  Kanye West, he tweeted out after  that moment saying \"I feel it's important to have a direct line of  communication with our future president if we truly want change.\" And then  tweeted out, \"2024.\" Look out.  All right, Anne then Charles, what about  this mix of folks today?   </p><p>GEARAN:  I don't even know where to start.  Ridiculous to the sublime and  something in between.  The idea of both Kanye West and Bill Gates having  significant face time with the president-elect shows at the very least the  president-elect has a varied interest.   </p><p>BAIER:  Charles, some people said that this was about not talking about  extracting himself from his businesses and delaying that press conference.   You buy that?   </p><p>KRAUTHAMMER:  No, I don't.  I mean, there were a lot of ways to avoid that,  but showing up with Kanye West is not one you would pick out of a hat.   </p><p>Look, this is very Trumpian.  The man knows how to put on a show and he  knows how to write a script.  What I liked best about today is that he  gives the energy department to a man whose campaign died because he  couldn't remember the name of the department that he wanted to abolish of  which he's now going to be the head.  That's good script writing, and I  think he ought to remain executive producer of \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" He's  earned the credential.   </p><p>BAIER:  Next up, the mixed messages from the intelligence community about  Russian interference in the election and reaction to all of that.     </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We knew that ahead of the election.  But it never got  the attention that I think it should, and so it's pretty soul-crushing to  have that come out now and confirm that they were, in fact, trying to help  Donald Trump.   </p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  It was Jim Comey's fault.  There  were going to have a recount in three states which ended up in an  embarrassing mess, millions of dollars spent, and all we did was gain more  votes for Donald Trump.  And then it was Russian interference.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BAIER:  Well, there you see the campaign managers for the two campaigns  talking about all of this talk of Russian interference in the election,  hacking and what impact it has.  Now we hear that the House Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi wants an independent probe like a 9/11 Commission to look into  this in addition to Congressional hearings on it.  Of course, there is some  debate in intelligence community.  This is the national intelligence  director November 17th on this very issue.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As far as the WikiLeaks connection, the evidence there  is not strong and we don't have good insight into the sequencing of the  releases or when that -- when the data may have been provided.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BAIER:  All right so where's this going and what's next?  We're back with  the panel.  Laura?   </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I think that the interagency squabbling over how much Russia  affected the election is kind of -- at this point it's beside the point.   It's clear, and I think Kellyanne is right about this, the left, they're  hopscotching from excuse to excuse.  They started with Comey.  And then  they said let's get rid of the Electoral College.  Then it was Russia.  And  then they will probably move on to something else.   </p><p>We have serious challenges, cyber security challenges in the United States.   And I think we have had intelligence failure after intelligence failure  since 9/11.  I mean, we obviously messed up Benghazi.  We didn't really  foresee the militarization of space that China is doing.  We really didn't  see what was coming in North Korea.  We missed overrun at the border and  what could be the implication of that.  There's a lot of things we are  missing.   </p><p>And on top of it, we are not on top of the curve when it comes to hacking  into government systems which has been going on for years and years.   Personnel files, 50 million of them were hacked by the Chinese.  And I  don't recall Barack Obama or any of the Democrats on Capitol Hill being  concerned that China would use the private information, the background  checks of millions of government employees, including yours truly, by the  way, for any nefarious means.  They didn't really make any big deal of  that.  </p><p>So now this is the big narrative because the Electoral College is going to  meet next week and we want to try to delegitimize the Trump victory.  This  does not surprise me at all.  I think they should do an investigation, but  come on.  This is now just, you know, pick your excuse except for your  policy failures.   </p><p>BAIER:  And what about that?  The electors, I guess there is 19, 20 of  them, calling for an intelligence briefing.  There are now Democrats saying  that is very important, that that happened before December 19th.  Is there  any constituency that believes that somehow this vote is going to change by  this whatever happens?   </p><p>GEARAN:  No, no.  I think Jennifer Palmieri and others from the Clinton  campaign would say the same.  They do not think that a briefing for  electors is going to overturn the results, just as they said ahead of the  recount that they didn't expect the recounts to overturn the results of the  election.   </p><p>That said, they are feeling very bruised because they did argue at the time  of the DNC hack in the spring and summer and then again when John Podesta - - it was clear that John Podesta's email had not only been hacked but being  released through WikiLeaks, they did contend then that this was a foreign  government attempt to undermine the credibility of the election with the  clear intent of making any victory that Hillary Clinton would at that time  have achieved seem cheapened.   </p><p>So they can make that argument.  They made it to me.  They made it to many  other reporters.  And they are feeling now they didn't get the kind of  hearing for that that it deserved.   </p><p>BAIER:  Yes.  And Charles, obviously, Reince Priebus and others are saying  Russia didn't make Hillary Clinton not stop in Wisconsin.  They didn't make  the economic message not identify with blue collar workers.  They are  pushing back hard.  But the overall concern about Russia doing anything is  real not only on the Democratic side but on the Republican side.   </p><p>KRAUTHAMMER:  The overall concern is real.  The idea that it gave the  election to Donald Trump I think is absurd.  The intelligence agencies  themselves are split.  There's no way to discern intent without having a  source inside, and we don't.   </p><p>But the real issue is this.  There is an extensive report on how this thing  developed over 18 months with the Obama administration knowing about this,  knowing about all kinds of intrusions by the Russians through others, and  the passivity of Barack Obama in the face of this is simply staggering.  It  quotes officials as saying in the end people were saying we have to do  something, some kind of retaliation to prevent or deter the Russians and/or  others, and Obama never did in part because he didn't want to lose  influence with Russia in Syria.  We can see how well that influence went  today when Aleppo essentially fell.  So this is a president who let it go  at a time when he could have done something.  We're going to have to be  clear to the Russians if they ever try anything like this again they will  suffer.   </p><p>BAIER:  Panel, Charles, Anne, Laura, thank you very much.  That's it for  the panel, but up next from here in warm Miami an adorable Facebook video  with nearly 25 million views.  It's a little chilly.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BAIER:  Finally tonight, from Miami to a park in Japan that is spreading  holiday cheer by putting some of its cutest residents in Santa suits.  Yes.   I don't know.  It had 25 million views on Facebook.  This is a park in  Japan.  They dressed up six of the penguins in Santa outfits, let them  waddle around.  They are hoping that they can get the Christmas spirit out  and about with their little penguin friends.  We thought it was good video.   So we will end the show with that. </p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  That's it for this SPECIAL  REPORT from Miami, fair, balanced and unafraid.  Here comes Tucker.   </p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

And this is a <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>alert. I'm Bret Baier, live tonight in Miami.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The House Minority Leader <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>is telling reporters tonight that she is now pushing for an independent probe outside of congress to study the allegations of Russian involvement in the election. She's also calling for congressional investigations, but an independent commission called for by the President, she says, like the 9/11 commission.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meantime more electors, Pelosi's daughter among them, are now calling for an intelligence briefing on what is known about Russian hacking before making the electoral vote official on December 19th. More on all of this in just a moment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, today was decision day for President-Elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>And he made official what we told you last night. ExxonMobil CEO <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>is his pick to be America's top diplomat. Like Trump, Tillerson has never served in government but has business ties all over the world.</p><p>But it's the Exxon CEO's ties to one particular country that are raising eyebrows in Washington -- Russia. Trump's chief of staff calls Tillerson a diplomat who happens to be able to drill oil.</p><p>Reaction today from Democrats and some Republicans is signaling what could be a big fight on Capitol Hill come confirmation time.</p><p>Senior national correspondent John Roberts is live tonight in Wisconsin where <person><nameText>President-Elect Trump's </nameText></person>thank-you tour resumes in about two hours and more breaking news from the transition, new picks.</p><p>Good evening -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening to you. We had learned in just the last hour that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has made another decision. He intends to name Montana Congressman <person><nameText>Ryan Zinke </nameText></person>as secretary of the Interior.</p><p>One of the things that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>really likes about Zinke is his military record. He was a member of SEAL Team Six holding the rank of commander. All in all, it was another busy day at Trump Tower.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: Another surprise appearance by <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in the lobby of Trump Tower today, after a meeting with his old friend, Kanye West.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT: He's a good man.</p><p>ROBERTS: Later a visit from Microsoft founder Bill Gates ahead of tomorrow's big tech summit. But the headline today was Trump's outside- the-box pick for secretary of State, ExxonMobil CEO <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson.</nameText></person></p><p>MIKE PENCE (R), <person><nameText>VICE PRESIDENT</nameText></person>-ELECT: We just couldn't be more grateful that someone of <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson's </nameText></person>proven leadership and accomplishments has been willing to step forward to serve our nation as our next secretary of State.</p><p>ROBERTS: While some members of congress including Republican Marco Rubio had concerns about Tillerson's deep ties to Russia, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today offered his full support.</p><p>Robert Gates who served as secretary of Defense under Presidents Bush and Obama today said of Tillerson quote, \"He would bring to the position vast knowledge, experience and success in dealing with dozens of governments and leaders in every corner of the world.\"</p><p>Bush secretary of State Condoleezza Rice added that Tillerson, quote, \"will represent the interests and the values of the United States with resolve and commitment.\"</p><p>And former <person><nameText>Vice President </nameText></person>Dick Cheney said Tillerson has, quote, \"the ability and judgment to deal with the very dangerous world we find confronting us.\"</p><p>Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus today defended Tillerson's relationship with Vladimir Putin.</p><p>REINCE PRIEBUS, TRUMP CHIEF OF STAFF: The truth is that having relationships with people is not a bad thing. I mean we have a lot of problems in this world and we're not going solve those problems by making believe that people don't exist.</p><p>ROBERTS: With only four cabinet positions left, <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>has learned that Trump has decided on former Texas Governor Rick Perry to be his Energy secretary. In the height of irony, energy is one of three departments Perry pledged to eliminate when he ran for president last cycle and the one he couldn't remember in a debate that torpedoed his candidacy.</p><p>RICK PERRY (R), FORMER GOVERNOR OF TEXAS: And let's see -- I can't, the third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops.</p><p>ROBERTS: The nation will have to wait a while longer to find out how <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will separate himself from his vast business empire. A press conference set for Thursday has now been pushed back to early January.</p><p>Transition sources say Trump's team bit off more than it could chew filling all the cabinet positions and just couldn't get the business plan in place in time.</p><p>PRIEBUS: What <person><nameText>President-Elect Trump </nameText></person>is doing with a lot of lawyers and a lot of people involved is just making sure that all government ethics are followed, that the is are dotted and the ts are crossed and he's going to make sure that nothing is compromised.</p><p>ROBERTS: On Twitter last night, Trump did give some hints of his plans. Pledging to leave his businesses by January 20th and turn them over to sons Eric and Don Jr. to manage with the condition that they make no new deals during his presidency.</p><p>The plan would appear to have Trump stay as an owner and free up daughter, Ivanka, to possibly take a position in his administration.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: By postponing that press conference until January, Trump derives two benefits. First of all it gives him more time to get his plan in place and second it avoids answering any difficult questions about his finances, his businesses or the CIA claim that Russian hackers are trying to help him become president before the electors vote, and that will happen on December 19th next Tuesday -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: John Roberts, live in Wisconsin. John -- thank you.</p><p>We told you at the top of the program, House Minority Leader <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>wants an independent probe of alleged Russian involvement in last month's election. But not everybody in the spy business sees Russia's digital fingerprints on the outcome. Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge sorts it all out for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: A U.S. government source says the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper who oversees the 17 intelligence agencies is not on the same page as CIA director John Brennan. The issue comes down to the hackers' intent, and whether there is strong evidence that Vladimir Putin's government meddled to ensure a Trump victory.</p><p>The White House spokesman said today Mr. Obama wants a formal assessment public.</p><p>JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: That's something that we'll try to do. The President does believe that we should, particularly when it relates to something as central to our democracy as the conduct of a national election.</p><p>HERRIDGE: The timing and targets of the cyber attacks varied widely. The hacks exposed via WikiLeaks e-mails belonging to the Clinton campaign team and the DNC. Another wave of attacks hit voter registration data from state boards of elections.</p><p>JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: We gave considerable thought to timing out Russia with that statement.</p><p>HERRIDGE: DNI Clapper told lawmakers last month that after the U.S. government publicly blamed Russia, the attacks against the state boards dropped off.</p><p>CLAPPER: I was referring to the cyber reconnaissance that we had observed.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Clapper said the Russian link to WikiLeaks and the Clinton campaign e-mails was more tenuous, when pressed by the committee's senior Democrat.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: I want to drill down a little further into your comment that the Russian activity curtailed after the issuance of the statement. The dumping of documents didn't end.</p><p>CLAPPER: As far as the WikiLeaks connection, the evidence there is not strong and we don't have good insight into the sequencing of the releases or when the data may have been provided.</p><p>HERRIDGE: In a letter Monday, the Republican chairman of the House Committee, Devin Nunes, asked Clapper to reconcile by Friday media reports that the CIA and FBI have developed conflicting intelligence assessments. A former intelligence officer said discerning Russia's motivation would be challenging.</p><p>LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>MILITARY ANALYST: For e-mail traffic and signals intelligence, you see patterns. What you need to define and find out intent is someone on the inside.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE: And late today the House Minority Leader <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>called for the creation of an independent probe along the lines of the 9/11 Commission that investigated the 2001 terrorist attacks. Pelosi also supports a separate congressional investigation and insisted to reporters tonight that her position would be exactly the same if Clinton had won in November -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: More on this with the panel.</p><p>Catherine -- thank you.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>BAIER: The alleged interference by Russia is also prompting some of the people who actually elect the president to ask for more information.</p><p>Chief Washington correspondent James Rosen has that part of the story tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AL GORE, FORMER <person><nameText>VICE PRESIDENT </nameText></person>OF THE UNITED STATES: George W. Bush of the state of Texas has received for president of the United States 271 votes.</p><p>JAMES ROSEN, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: And with that, <person><nameText>Vice President </nameText></person>Al Gore, Democratic nominee and winner of the popular vote in 2000, serving as president of the Senate, certified that the Electoral College had awarded the presidency to Republican nominee, George W. Bush.</p><p>Now the never-Trumpers -- remember them -- see the Electoral College which <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>also won without capturing the popular vote as the final arena for blocking the President-Elect from taking the oath. 30 members of the Electoral College including one Republican citing the conclusion of the Central Intelligence Agency that Russia actively interfered to sway the outcome of the election have written to Director of National Intelligence General James Clapper seeking a briefing on the underlying intelligence before the electors cast their votes December 19th. And leading the charge is a California elector who is the daughter of House Minority Leader <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi.</nameText></person></p><p>CHRISTINE PELOSI, CALIFORNIA ELECTOR: Our independent elections ought to be what define us as a country. And so if there is evidence that not only was the election tainted but that one of the candidates knew about that and profited from it, then that certainly is something that the electors should know in advance.</p><p>ROSEN: Supporting the request is the chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign, John Podesta, the very person whose e-mail account posted online by WikiLeaks is said by CIA to have been hacked with Russian complicity.</p><p>The White House, however, stopped short of endorsing the request, indeed, pointed out a big hurdle to granting it.</p><p>EARNEST: Look, I know that, you know, some of the requests was for classified information and it's not clear that all of the electors, and I'm sure most of them don't, don't have security clearances.</p><p>ROSEN: The President-Elect told \"<person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>SUNDAY\" that Democrats are peddling the account of Russian meddling, because, quote, they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of American politics.</p><p>TRUMP: It's ridiculous. We ought to get back to making America great again which is what we're going to do and we've already started the process.</p><p>ROSEN: As the Electoral College vote approaches, some Trump electors have reported being on the receiving end of hate mail and worse.</p><p>MICHAEL, MICHIGAN ELECTOR: Unfortunately, I've received a couple of death threats, some death wishes and just some angry messages from people who are disappointed in the election results.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROSEN: A source at the Republican National Committee told me that what concern exists over this play for the Electoral College is tied not to defections but to resignations. Not all states have replacement mechanisms in place -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: All right, James. Thank you.</p><p>Now that the President-Elect has selected three more cabinet members, there is one unofficial position to talk about tonight. Maybe it can be called ambassador to the left.</p><p>National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports it appears one of the first daughters-to-be may already have the job.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JENNIFER GRIFFIN, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: She's the executive <person><nameText>vice president </nameText></person>of the Trump Organization, a former model, and mother of three. And she may just be her father's secret weapon, serving as a bridge to the left. A lifestyle guru who's built a business in her own right, Ivanka Trump has pushed her father on the environment and women's health issues.</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Equality, childcare -- these are things that are very important for me.</p><p>GRIFFIN: She helped soften her father's image in the wake of the \"Access: Hollywood\" audiotape starring in this campaign ad called \"Motherhood\".</p><p>I. TRUMP: He will provide tax credits for childcare.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Ivanka helped insert language into her father's platform that would appeal to your average Democrat. In fact, she and her brothers couldn't vote for their father in the New York primary because they were still registered Democrats.</p><p>I. TRUMP: Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career.</p><p>GRIFFIN: In recent weeks, Ivanka has arranged for her father to meet with former <person><nameText>Vice President </nameText></person>Al Gore, to hear his views on global warming -- a move that took environmentalists by surprise. She's met twice with Leonardo DiCaprio to talk about the environment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It looks a little bit like a head fake when you have her meet with Al Gore one day and then the next day <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>turns around and picks for EPA someone who hasn't always said that he believes that climate change is real.</p><p>Reporter: Ivanka and husband, Jared Kushner, traveled to Washington, D.C., on Sunday and dined at their family hotel with Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, Trump's pick for Transportation secretary. They also may have been house hunting.</p><p>Longtime political producer and Washington host, Tammy Haddad, said Democrats would be wise to embrace Ivanka.</p><p>TAMMY HADDAD, POLITICAL PRODUCER: I don't know if Ivanka Trump can change anyone's mind. I don't know if the Democrats will listen to him. I don't know if people in Washington who were against him will now come into the tent. What I do know is that Ivanka Trump has the biggest opportunity to bring the most people in.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFIN: Once friends with Chelsea Clinton, Ivanka reportedly was the one her father handed the phone to when House Minority Leader <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>called him after the election to talk about women's health care. As first daughter, she may be one of her father's most important ambassadors -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Jennifer -- thank you.</p><p>Stocks were up today. The Dow gained 115 for another record close, closing just shy of 20,000. The S&amp;P 500 finished ahead 15. The Nasdaq surged 51.</p><p>Let's get some analysis of the markets tonight. Fox Business Network's Trish Regan is in New York. Good evening -- Trish. 89 points until 20k -- we think it happens this week. What is behind all this momentum?</p><p>TRISH REGAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I think it very well could. I mean there was a good shot of it happening today. At one point we were really within that 50-point range of hitting 20,000. But I think it could happen as soon as tomorrow, certainly sometime this week and certainly before the end of the year.</p><p>Traders are banking on this. There's a lot of momentum right now and it's hard to stop. There's an expectation that there will be lower taxes, that there will be less regulation and these are things that are just music to businesses' ears and it's one of the reasons why you're seeing all this upside right now -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: You know, we often talk, Trish, about the Fed and the Federal Reserve announces its decision on interest rates tomorrow. Most are expecting a bump in interest rates by a quarter of a point. What else are they watching out for with the Fed?</p><p>REGAN: Well, they want to see what exactly the Fed says in terms of its tone for the future because the question is, all right, you may get that quarter-point hike, but are you going to get another one at the next Fed meeting? Does the Fed actually think the economy is gaining enough strength that it can move forward with this interest rate rising policy, you know, one after another in each meeting? Or are they going to sort of space these out? So they'll be looking to find out what the pace of the increase for these interest rate hikes actually will be.</p><p>There's also some questions about whether or not the market can sustain these kind of levels once interest rates move higher. So that will be very critical to watch the market tomorrow, to see how traders react to this expectation of the quarter point hike.</p><p>And we'll also be watching very carefully to see if Janet Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, says anything about <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and how she thinks the economy might fare under him. She obviously doesn't want to get too political, the Fed never does. Nut these are the things that traders will be looking to hear.</p><p>BAIER: Trish, as always -- thank you. We'll be watching you on FBN tomorrow for all that breaking news.</p><p>Pro-immigration forces have come up with a new way to fight <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>over his stated plans to deport illegal immigrants with criminal records.</p><p>Correspondent Claudia Cowan reports tonight from San Francisco. It involves making you pay to fight the feds -- Claudia.</p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Bret, San Francisco is doubling down on its so-called sanctuary city status by considering a $5 million plan to hire more lawyers to defend illegal immigrants facing deportation including those who've been arrested for committing other crimes in this country.</p><p>At a recent rally here on the steps of San Francisco's city hall former detainees said their lack of access to an immigration lawyer turned their lives upside-down. And they're worried about President-Elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>idea to deport millions of illegal immigrants -- a plan Trump has since tempered.</p><p>But county supervisor David Campos introduced the legislation arguing everyone deserves the same access to public resources and he defends this use of tax dollars.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID CAMPOS, SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISOR: We're going to invest the resources needed to make sure that the 44,000 undocumented people who live in the city and county of San Francisco have at a minimum legal representation if they're taken into immigration court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COWAN: But the move faces opposition even inside city hall. Mayor Ed Lee, a staunch supporter of policies friendly to illegal immigrants, says he's concerned about some of the funding aspects of this legislation, while critics of the whole idea contend moves like this continue to encourage illegal immigration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICK OLTMAN, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ACTIVIST: What we need to be sending is a message around the world, a message of discouragement to reduce the flow to our border. That will make securing the border easier.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COWAN: But in the wake of the election other cities including New York and Chicago are also looking to set aside millions of dollars to hire lawyers to help fight deportations. But eventually city officials may also have to consider which city programs will have to go because <person><nameText>President-Elect Trump </nameText></person>has also vowed to cut federal funding to these so-called sanctuary cities and here in San Francisco that could total more than $1 billion a year -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Claudia -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, what will President-Elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>do in his first 100 days in office about energy and infrastructure? Some big changes could be afoot. Stay tuned.</p><p>Back live in Miami tonight after this.</p><p>BAIER: Welcome back to Miami.</p><p>Tonight's installment of our series on the first 100 days of the Trump administration focuses on energy and infrastructure. <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>election is providing hope to areas of the country that have lost much of their way of life because of changing attitudes about coal and green energy.</p><p>National correspondent William La Jeunesse takes us to one of those places tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fire.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just the coal itself, it's the downstream value to our economy, to our people, to our community.</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hotchkiss, Colorado calls itself the friendliest town around. It's anything but for the coal industry.</p><p>In this area of Western Colorado there were three coal mines, now there's only one. But coal isn't the only casualty. You're also killing a community.</p><p>MAYOR WENDELL KOONTZ, HOTCHKISS, COLORADO: UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, this is empty.</p><p>Yes, this used to be a quilt store.</p><p>This is Pastime Friendly Tavern. It closed just this year.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Mayor Wendell Koontz saw 1,200 jobs disappear in one year.</p><p>KOONTZ: For every one job at the mine they estimate there's five to seven jobs down valley.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Coal provided 50 percent of U.S. electricity eight years ago -- today, 31 percent and falling.</p><p>Is it market driven? Is it politics? What does <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>represent in that equation?</p><p>KOONTZ: It's probably a little bit of both. The shutdown of a lot of the coal-fired plants and the loss of market is due to regulations that have restricted emissions from coal-fired plants. So it is a combination of that and cheap natural gas.</p><p>TRUMP: We're going to save that coal industry, believe me. We're going to save it.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: President Trump promised to cut coal regulations including the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement which dramatically restrict U.S. carbon emissions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's tough on the communities. It's tough on the people at the mine, you know. You have friends that you worked with for years that are no longer there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They don't know what to do. I mean, this is their livelihood.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Think about it, when you're 40, 50 years old, what do you do? Do you go back to college and say, ok, what do I want to be when I grow up?</p><p>TRUMP: Under my presidency, we'll accomplish a complete American energy independence. Complete.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: To do that, Trump promises to open federal lands to oil and gas drilling and lift the effective ban on offshore drilling outside the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>ROB BISHOP (R-UT), HOUSE NATURAL RESOURCES CHAIRMAN: I am excited and I am nervous at the same time because it's not going to be as easy as some people think.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Why? Because Congressman Rob Bishop says opponents can still use the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Protection Act to stop energy development.</p><p>BISHOP: The goal is to have abundant, affordable energy. That makes our economy grow.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: That includes alternative energy. Though Trump criticized wind and solar in the campaign, renewables now provide more than 30 percent of the power in ten states.</p><p>STEVE LOCKHARD, TPI COMPOSITES CEO: The cost of wind has come down 61 percent in the last 6 years. It's equal to or better than low cost natural gas in the U.S.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Steve Lockhart's company makes wind turbine blades in Iowa.</p><p>LOCKHARD: We contribute $50 million a year just in payroll and direct benefits to our employees.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Because 600,000 now work in wind and solar, most expect Trump won't cut the production tax credit. His infrastructure plan also modernizes the power grid while support for the North Dakota Access and Keystone Pipelines would move oil more cheaply.</p><p>HERB MORGAN, FLUOR CORP SENIOR <person><nameText>VICE PRESIDENT</nameText></person>: Looking at the President's trillion dollars over ten years from a Fluor perspective, we think that's, you know, a wonderful thing.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Business and labor support his infrastructure plan. The challenge is building big projects without producing big deficits.</p><p>TRUMP: It will be deficit neutral.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Trump would essentially replace federal subsidies with tax breaks to induce private companies to invest their money.</p><p>MORGAN: We had about 1,400 craft work on this job. That translated into another 7,500 jobs.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: In other projects, say road and rail, government can reduce its upfront cost by spreading the risks and sharing the reward or revenue stream. In this case -- from tolls, ticket sales or fees.</p><p>TRUMP: This is your treasure and you, the American people, are entitled to share in the riches.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Trump hopes to leverage federal money and tax policy to induce investment. But ultimately projects and industries live or die only if they make money.</p><p>In Hotchkiss, Colorado -- William La Jeunesse, <person><nameText>Fox News.</nameText></person></p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAIER: Our 15-part series looking ahead to the first 100 days of the Trump presidency continues tomorrow with a look at the fate of the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>A lot of news on the abortion front tonight. Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich has signed a bill imposing a 20-week abortion ban. Kasich vetoed a separate measure that would have barred abortions at the first detectable fetal heartbeat.</p><p>The Oklahoma Supreme Court has thrown out a law requiring doctors at clinics to have hospital admitting privileges. That ruling overturns a lower court decision.</p><p>And here in Florida a federal judge is being asked to block additional parts of this state's contentious abortion law over constitutional rights issues. The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Florida, filed a lawsuit late yesterdays on behalf of several ministers, rabbis and organizations that provide abortion counseling services to women.</p><p>Tonight, we bring you an exclusive first look at some shocking information about just how dangerous some abortion clinics are in this country.</p><p>Chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream tells us the information comes as President-Elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>considers his policy on abortion funding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: A brand new report by the pro-life legal advocacy group, Americans United for Life, tracks hundreds of abortion clinics in 32 states, compiling more than 1,400 health and safety violations since 2008.</p><p>Calling it the evidence the Supreme Court needs to see, following the justices' decision to strike down Texas clinic regulations earlier this year.</p><p>CLARKE FORSYTHE, AMERICANS UNITED FOR LIFE: This report is a rebuke to the Supreme Court's tragic decision in June in the Texas abortion case where the court threw out health and safety standards for Texas abortion clinics saying that we need more proof. Well here's the proof.</p><p>BREAM: The report and accompanying videos entitled \"Unsafe\" come at the same time the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute is publishing its own warnings, highlighting concerns about access and funding for abortions. In the report's section entitled \"Patient safeguards\", Guttmacher focuses on doing away with barriers or delays, not clinic regulations or protocols.</p><p>Guttmacher's concerns are shared by other pro-choice groups but fear what a Trump administration may mean including Planned Parenthood which receives roughly half a billion dollars in government funding each year.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>HOST: Should American taxpayers though pay $500 billion to that organization?</p><p>TRUMP: No, I said to fund, I didn't say pay.

The White House ordered a review in October following the bombing of a funeral home in Yemen that killed more than 140 people. <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>is told the sale involved so-called smart bombs to the Saudis.

Exxon Mobil CEO <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>will be his nominee for secretary of state. Reaction is in in Washington. We'll get reaction from our panel to that and other picks tonight when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>(R) PRESIDENT-ELECT: He's much more than a business executive. I mean, he's a world-class player.</p><p>REINCE PRIEBUS, TRUMP CHIEF OF STAFF: <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>is a really tough guy. The good lord didn't put oil in all freedom-loving democracies across the world.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, (R) FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has selected somebody who knows the world and can advise him on the world. If you pick somebody like that, somewhere, someplace, they're going to have some issues that you're going to have to deal with.</p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER, (R) TENNESSEE: Obviously there's been some flirting, if you will, with Russia that's been a little different than what we're used to. Obviously <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>will come to these hearings with that knowledge, and I'm sure will, I hope will do everything he can to allay any fears that people have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: As we reported last night, <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson, </nameText></person>the CEO of Exxon Mobil, is <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>pick to be the nominee of secretary of state. He tweeted out, the president-elect did today, \"The thing I like best about <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>is that he has vast experience in dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.\" He's not alone in that. Former <person><nameText>vice president </nameText></person>Dick Cheney releasing a statement saying \"This election of <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>to be secretary of state is an inspired choice. He has the vast experience, ability, and judgment to deal with the very dangerous world we find confronting us. His extensive knowledge of the global situation will be an asset in representing our nation.\"</p><p>But not all Republicans feel that way. Obviously Democrats have weighed in, but Marco Rubio, senator from right here in Florida, tweeted out \"Being a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I am hoping for a secretary of state.\"</p><p>With that, let's bring in our panel, I'm in Miami, they're in Washington, editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham, Anne Gearan, political correspondent for \"The Washington Post,\" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Laura, you've listened to the reaction all day to <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson. </nameText></person>Your thoughts on where this is coming down, and is this going to be a confirmation fight on Capitol Hill?</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM: I'm not sure how much of a fight it's going to be. I think it's quite something to hear from Senator Corker talk about the flirtation between Tillerson and Putin when, first of all, under the Bush administration, I remember those gauzy pictures captured with Putin and President Bush at the ranch in cowboy duds, and looking into his soul and seeing deeply into it. And of course the failed Russian reset on behalf of Hillary Clinton's efforts with the former Soviet Union, and then, of course, Barack Obama's telling Medvedev that he'd have more flexibility after the 2012 election cycle. It seems to me there was a lot of attempts to get closer to Russia in the last two administrations but not a lot of success in dealing with Russia.</p><p>So I think it's good to have someone from a different community, the business community, who's actually been successful in dealing with the former Soviet Union. And I think it's refreshing to have someone from his background and I think it's about time. We've had a lot of intelligence and foreign policy failures with the so-called pros in charge.</p><p>BAIER: And the Trump transition team is pointing out Tillerson is a tough negotiator around the world. He said no numerous times to Vladimir Putin in tough deals and deal making, he knows world leaders around the world. But clearly the opposition to Tillerson is pretty fierce on the left, and it seems like they're going to make at least Tillerson a target in the confirmation process.</p><p>ANNE GEARAN, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Sure. They're going to try to bloody him up a little bit. I mean, as a practical matter, his being somebody that Democrats don't particularly like or wouldn't be their pick, it is not much of a concern for a Trump White House as long as they can hold together at least 50 and probably 51 at least of the Republican votes, they can get him through.</p><p>But I'm really interested in how they are -- the Trump team is trying to turn what seems to be Tillerson's greatest liability, his time on the world stage in dealing with foreign governments and the kinds of deals he's had to make to get his business deals done, into an asset, saying that this is a guy who understands how not only -- not only does he understand geopolitics and how the world works, but he understands how these leaders think, and even if we as a country don't agree with those leaders, understanding their worldview and understanding how they make deals and how they view the United States from a business perspective is actually an asset. That's going to be the chief argument they make on the Hill.</p><p>BAIER: Charles, obviously Exxon Mobil one of the biggest if not the biggest company in the world, and we've talked many times about the bureaucracy in Washington. The State Department is a behemoth when it comes to bureaucracy. To shake that up, you need somebody perhaps that has the experience of shaking up companies?</p><p>CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think that's an asset. His knowledge of the world is an asset. To some extent, his relationship with Putin is an asset if it gives him insight into how to deal with him.</p><p>But, look, the issue is going to be what are his feelings about Putin right now? What will they be as a representative not of an oil company that has interest in the oil in the Russian arctic, but as secretary of state of the United States?</p><p>And that's why you have hearings. They're going to ask him what is your sense of Putin's motive? Is he a potential ally? Is he an adversary? Is he somebody who, as it appears to many of us, is intent on diminishing American influence and expanding Russian fear of influence, particularly in eastern Europe and the Middle East?</p><p>But we shouldn't prejudge him until we hear what he has to say. And the reason is that he comes in as a man who dealt on behalf of the oil company, his oil company as a fiduciary. It reminds me of 1982 when Alexander Hague stepped down as secretary of state and George Schultz came up. And he was the president of Bechtel, an engineering construction around the world, that had extensive dealings with the Saudis and Gulf Arabs. It was suspected that perhaps Schultz had sympathies that would tilt him on the Arab side of the Arab-Israeli dispute. It turned out not to be the case at all and Schultz is one of the great secretaries of state of the second half of the last century. So we will see how the man acts and speaks representing his country and not an oil company.</p><p>BAIER: Meantime, Laura, you have pick for secretary of energy, former Texas governor Rick Perry. And all day long every cable channel played the infamous 40-second sound bite from that debate where he can't remember the third agency, which happens to be energy, that he wants to get rid of in the GOP primary. But obviously his career is not judged by a brain freeze in that debate. What about Governor Perry for energy?</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think Perry is perfectly acceptable and terrific pick. As former governor of the state of Texas, we know the job boom that Texas has been experiencing even with the declining price of oil. And the industry there, of course, energy, health care that has shown so much incredible improvement and growth whereas many sectors of the U.S. economy have really been lagging behind.</p><p>Rick Perry was a terrific leader of that state, and his brain freeze at the debate notwithstanding, I think he's in line with Trump's view we have to real he move forward to deregulate and remove some of the tangle of the bureaucracy in the energy sector while, of course, protecting the environment and doing a good balancing act there, that it's absolutely incumbent upon the department of energy and this president to make sure we have good-paying jobs in the United States, which in large part are found in the energy sector. So I think it's a terrific pick and I think it's nice to see all these people who didn't have all that many good words for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>getting onboard. I think it's good stuff.</p><p>BAIER: Yes, a cancer of conservatism to a pick in his cabinet. Anne, and then Charles, I want it play one more sound bite quickly before we go to the next panel, and that is different people who showed up at Trump tower today. It was quite a mix.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, impact foreign aid and energy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not here because of politics. We are here to help the president of the United States help his people that need help.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Forget black or white. Black or white is irrelevant. The bottom line is job creation, economic development in these urban neighborhoods.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just want to take a picture right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: \"Just want to take a picture.\" Kanye West, he tweeted out after that moment saying \"I feel it's important to have a direct line of communication with our future president if we truly want change.\" And then tweeted out, \"2024.\" Look out. All right, Anne then Charles, what about this mix of folks today?</p><p>GEARAN: I don't even know where to start. Ridiculous to the sublime and something in between. The idea of both Kanye West and Bill Gates having significant face time with the president-elect shows at the very least the president-elect has a varied interest.</p><p>BAIER: Charles, some people said that this was about not talking about extracting himself from his businesses and delaying that press conference. You buy that?</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: No, I don't. I mean, there were a lot of ways to avoid that, but showing up with Kanye West is not one you would pick out of a hat.</p><p>Look, this is very Trumpian. The man knows how to put on a show and he knows how to write a script. What I liked best about today is that he gives the energy department to a man whose campaign died because he couldn't remember the name of the department that he wanted to abolish of which he's now going to be the head. That's good script writing, and I think he ought to remain executive producer of \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" He's earned the credential.</p><p>BAIER: Next up, the mixed messages from the intelligence community about Russian interference in the election and reaction to all of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We knew that ahead of the election. But it never got the attention that I think it should, and so it's pretty soul-crushing to have that come out now and confirm that they were, in fact, trying to help <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: It was Jim Comey's fault. There were going to have a recount in three states which ended up in an embarrassing mess, millions of dollars spent, and all we did was gain more votes for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>And then it was Russian interference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Well, there you see the campaign managers for the two campaigns talking about all of this talk of Russian interference in the election, hacking and what impact it has. Now we hear that the House Minority Leader <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>wants an independent probe like a 9/11 Commission to look into this in addition to Congressional hearings on it. Of course, there is some debate in intelligence community. This is the national intelligence director November 17th on this very issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As far as the WikiLeaks connection, the evidence there is not strong and we don't have good insight into the sequencing of the releases or when that -- when the data may have been provided.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: All right so where's this going and what's next? We're back with the panel. Laura?</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think that the interagency squabbling over how much Russia affected the election is kind of -- at this point it's beside the point. It's clear, and I think Kellyanne is right about this, the left, they're hopscotching from excuse to excuse. They started with Comey. And then they said let's get rid of the Electoral College. Then it was Russia. And then they will probably move on to something else.</p><p>We have serious challenges, cyber security challenges in the United States. And I think we have had intelligence failure after intelligence failure since 9/11. I mean, we obviously messed up Benghazi. We didn't really foresee the militarization of space that China is doing. We really didn't see what was coming in North Korea. We missed overrun at the border and what could be the implication of that. There's a lot of things we are missing.</p><p>And on top of it, we are not on top of the curve when it comes to hacking into government systems which has been going on for years and years. Personnel files, 50 million of them were hacked by the Chinese. And I don't recall Barack Obama or any of the Democrats on Capitol Hill being concerned that China would use the private information, the background checks of millions of government employees, including yours truly, by the way, for any nefarious means. They didn't really make any big deal of that.</p><p>So now this is the big narrative because the Electoral College is going to meet next week and we want to try to delegitimize the Trump victory. This does not surprise me at all. I think they should do an investigation, but come on. This is now just, you know, pick your excuse except for your policy failures.</p><p>BAIER: And what about that? The electors, I guess there is 19, 20 of them, calling for an intelligence briefing. There are now Democrats saying that is very important, that that happened before December 19th. Is there any constituency that believes that somehow this vote is going to change by this whatever happens?</p><p>GEARAN: No, no. I think Jennifer Palmieri and others from the Clinton campaign would say the same. They do not think that a briefing for electors is going to overturn the results, just as they said ahead of the recount that they didn't expect the recounts to overturn the results of the election.</p><p>That said, they are feeling very bruised because they did argue at the time of the DNC hack in the spring and summer and then again when John Podesta - - it was clear that John Podesta's email had not only been hacked but being released through WikiLeaks, they did contend then that this was a foreign government attempt to undermine the credibility of the election with the clear intent of making any victory that Hillary Clinton would at that time have achieved seem cheapened.</p><p>So they can make that argument. They made it to me. They made it to many other reporters. And they are feeling now they didn't get the kind of hearing for that that it deserved.</p><p>BAIER: Yes. And Charles, obviously, Reince Priebus and others are saying Russia didn't make Hillary Clinton not stop in Wisconsin. They didn't make the economic message not identify with blue collar workers. They are pushing back hard. But the overall concern about Russia doing anything is real not only on the Democratic side but on the Republican side.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: The overall concern is real. The idea that it gave the election to <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>I think is absurd. The intelligence agencies themselves are split. There's no way to discern intent without having a source inside, and we don't.</p><p>But the real issue is this. There is an extensive report on how this thing developed over 18 months with the Obama administration knowing about this, knowing about all kinds of intrusions by the Russians through others, and the passivity of Barack Obama in the face of this is simply staggering. It quotes officials as saying in the end people were saying we have to do something, some kind of retaliation to prevent or deter the Russians and/or others, and Obama never did in part because he didn't want to lose influence with Russia in Syria. We can see how well that influence went today when Aleppo essentially fell. So this is a president who let it go at a time when he could have done something. We're going to have to be clear to the Russians if they ever try anything like this again they will suffer.</p><p>BAIER: Panel, Charles, Anne, Laura, thank you very much. That's it for the panel, but up next from here in warm Miami an adorable Facebook video with nearly 25 million views. It's a little chilly.</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, from Miami to a park in Japan that is spreading holiday cheer by putting some of its cutest residents in Santa suits. Yes. I don't know. It had 25 million views on Facebook. This is a park in Japan. They dressed up six of the penguins in Santa outfits, let them waddle around. They are hoping that they can get the Christmas spirit out and about with their little penguin friends. We thought it was good video. So we will end the show with that.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT from Miami, fair, balanced and unafraid. Here comes Tucker.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2016121301cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MCX-B0P1-JB20-G42T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8063\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 13, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>XOM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Espionage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Energy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Infrastructure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Abortion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Ad Policy[3] He is\u2014it should go without saying\u2014wrong. Indeed, the whole point of writing the First Amendment was to establish the right of the people and the media to object to claims by presidents and other powerful officials\u2014especially when those claims are lies. Unfortunately, Trump needs his lies. Desperately. The president understands that at a point when his approval ratings are collapsing[4] because of a jarringly awful response to the coronavirus pandemic and mass unemployment, only a campaign based on false premises and the crudest deceits can keep him competitive in the 2020 presidential race. So this president is ready to use the power of his position to attack the basic underpinnings of the First Amendment. Furious that Twitter attached a clarifying link to a false tweet he sent about mail-in voting, Trump on Wednesday tweeted[5], 'Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!' On Thursday, in what The Hill described[6] as 'a marked escalation of his lengthy feud with Silicon Valley over allegations of anti-conservative bias,' Trump signed an executive order that seeks to increase the authority of the government to regulate social media platforms. Trump's order would strip liability protection from companies that give a platform to controversial content, have Attorney General William Barr work with states to develop regulations, and ensure that government funding does not go to news outlets that 'suppress' speech that the administration favors.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/authors/john-nichols/\">https://www.thenation.com/authors/john-nichols/</url> MORE FROM John Nichols[7] Trump declared, 'We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers.' Trump's statement twisted the truth to the breaking point\u2014as he acknowledged[8] even as he signed the order, saying, 'I guess it's going to be challenged in court.' The president is not defending the First Amendment. He is proposing a fiercely unconstitutional reinterpretation of it that serves his political interests. 'Much as he might wish otherwise, Donald Trump is not the president of Twitter,' declared[9] the American Civil Liberties Union as a draft of the president's order circulated early Thursday. 'This order, if issued, would be a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies.' That's true. But this is about more than Trump's feud[10] with the managers of a social media platform. As Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe reminds us[11], 'The unconstitutional character of his threats doesn't prevent them from undermining everyone's liberties.' Trump is playing politics. He knows he has to discredit even mild assertions of the facts because, as he prepares for a difficult reelection race, he has nothing but lies to offer the American people. So he is not merely attacking fact-checking but trying to revoke the right to speak truth to power. The specifics of what Trump proposes are draconian. The media advocacy group Free Press[12] reviewed the draft of the president's order and labeled it an 'unconstitutional attempt to silence critics and fact checkers.' Of deepest concern were plans to: require the Federal Communications Commission to craft a rule that would potentially exempt social-media companies from protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law that shields companies from legal liability for the material their users post online. call on the White House Office of Digital Strategy to 'reactivate' a tool through which people can report cases of so-called 'online censorship and other potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices by online platforms.' The tool would collect complaints of online censorship and submit them to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission for potential follow-up. prohibit all federal agencies and offices from spending government money on advertising with platforms that allegedly 'violate free speech principles.' Free Press senior policy counsel Gaurav Laroia argued on Thursday that the draft order represents 'a naked attempt by the president to bully into silence Twitter, other social-media sites and anyone who attempts to correct or criticize Trump. This blatant and bungling attempt at censorship is outrageous and unconstitutional.' It is also a political strategy.  Current Issue       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/june-1-8-2020-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/june-1-8-2020-issue/</url> Trump has a base of core supporters who are likely to embrace whatever he says, no matter how outrageous it may be. But that base is insufficient to reelect him. To get the votes he needs, he has to be able to convince a wider portion of the electorate that factual reports of his wrongdoing and incompetence are part of a media conspiracy to dislodge him from the White House. That's why the president keeps claiming that media outlets and individual journalists are 'enemies of the people.' And that's why he and his campaign are now going after Twitter and other social media platforms. When Twitter finally got around to some mild fact-checking of Trump, the president's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, reacted by saying[13], 'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters. Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility.' Trump has charted his course. The question now is whether presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his campaign will counter Trump effectively. To do that, the Democratic campaign must provide a robust defense of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and net neutrality\u2014the First Amendment of the Internet. One statement won't do. Biden and his supporters have to make this fight central to their 2020 campaign and explain what's at stake. They do not have to defend media monopolies or tech titans. They have to defend the Constitution itself\u2014boldly, and in explicit detail. Trump has made the First Amendment an issue by attacking it. Democrats must mount a campaign that champions freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to tell presidents they are wrong.

Furious that Twitter attached a clarifying link to a false tweet he sent about mail-in voting, Trump on Wednesday       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">tweeted</url>, \"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!\"</p><p>On Thursday, in what <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Hill</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/500006-trump-signs-order-targeting-social-media-firms-legal-protections\">described</url> as \"a marked escalation of his lengthy feud with Silicon Valley over allegations of anti-conservative bias,\" Trump signed an executive order that seeks to increase the authority of the government to regulate social media platforms. The order would strip liability protection from companies that give a platform to controversial content, have Attorney General William Barr work with states to develop regulations, and ensure that government funding does not go to news outlets that \"suppress\" speech that the administration favors.</p><p>Trump declared, \"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers.\"</p><p>His statement twisted the truth to the breaking point-as even he seemed to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/28/coronavirus-us-live-trump-executive-order-twitter-death-toll-latest-updates\">acknowledge</url> when he admitted during the signing of the order, \"I guess it's going to be challenged in court.\"</p><p>The president is not defending the First Amendment. He is proposing a fiercely unconstitutional reinterpretation of it that serves his political interests.</p><p>\"Much as he might wish otherwise, Donald Trump is not the president of Twitter,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1266017892308410368\">declared</url> the American Civil Liberties Union as a draft of the order circulated early Thursday. \"This order, if issued, would be a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies.\"</p><p>That's true. But this is about more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/28/trump-attacks-twitter-employee-while-defending-fact-checked-tweets.html\">Trump's feud</url> with the managers of a social media platform.</p><p>As Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/tribelaw/status/1265941421275709440\">reminds us</url>, \"The unconstitutional character of his threats doesn't prevent them from undermining everyone's liberties.\"</p><p>Trump is playing politics. He knows he has to discredit even mild assertions of the facts because, as he prepares for a difficult reelection race, he has nothing but lies to offer the American people. So he is not merely attacking fact-checking but trying to revoke the right to speak truth to power.</p><p>The specifics of what Trump proposes are draconian. The media advocacy group <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.freepress.net/news\">Free Press</url> reviewed the draft of the president's order and labeled it an \"unconstitutional attempt to silence critics and fact checkers.\" Of deepest concern were plans to:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>require the Federal Communications Commission to craft a rule that would potentially exempt social-media companies from protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law that shields companies from legal liability for the material their users post online.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>call on the White House Office of Digital Strategy to \"reactivate\" a tool through which people can report cases of \"online censorship and other potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices by online platforms.\" The tool would collect complaints of online censorship and submit them to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission for potential follow-up.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>prohibit all federal agencies and offices from spending government money on advertising with platforms that allegedly \"violate free speech principles.\"</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Free Press senior policy counsel Gaurav Laroia argued on Thursday that the order is \"a naked attempt by the president to bully into silence Twitter, other social-media sites and anyone who attempts to correct or criticize Trump. This blatant and bungling attempt at censorship is outrageous and unconstitutional.\"</p><p>It is also a political strategy.</p><p>Trump has core supporters who are likely to embrace whatever he says, no matter how outrageous it may be. But that base is insufficient to reelect him. To get the votes he needs, he has to convince a wider portion of the electorate that factual reports of his wrongdoing and incompetence are part of a media conspiracy to dislodge him from the White House. That's why the president keeps claiming that media outlets and individual journalists are \"enemies of the people.\" And that's why he and his campaign are now going after Twitter and other social media platforms. When Twitter finally got around to some mild fact-checking of Trump, his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/trump-campaign-statement-on-new-twitter-policy\">reacted by saying</url>, \"We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters. Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility.\"</p><p>Trump has charted his course. The question now is whether presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his campaign will counter Trump effectively. To do that, the Democratic campaign must provide a robust defense of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and Net neutrality-the First Amendment of the Internet. One statement won't do. Biden and his supporters have to make this fight central to their 2020 campaign and explain what's at stake. They do not have to defend media monopolies or tech titans. They have to defend the Constitution itself-boldly and in explicit detail. Trump has made the First Amendment an issue by attacking it. Democrats must mount a campaign that champions freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to tell presidents they are wrong.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-351332</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-F1F1-JB81-B0KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkU5NzdDMzI5QTcxNDQ5QTg3NDAwNjNGM0MwMTgxNEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODdEMDhDREQzOEQ2NDE2RkE2Njk3RTNEMUM0NTE3MEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDk1NjM1M0M1QUYxNDlEMDgxNjI1Qzk3NkRDNDhCRjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwRjUxMDRFN0JBNEMxMEI3MDhDNzhBMjA4NzU2MzM</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Scope</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFFNzEwMUYzNEU3NDdGRTg4RUM2OUM0ODI1ODg2QjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000669</classCode><className>EXECUTIVE ORDERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOB0</classCode><className>FACT CHECKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000761</classCode><className>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg</classCode><className>Freedom of Speech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000271</classCode><className>CENSORSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

In particular, their ire is targeted toward social media companies who they, sometimes fairly, perceive as biased and censorious. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president just signed an executive order instructing federal agencies to reinterpret Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the liability-shielding provision that enables social media\u2019s existence. Trump has gone even further in a series of recent tweets, explicitly calling to outright revoke Section 230 protections: TweetTweetTweet</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, it\u2019s worth considering just what the ramifications of repealing Section 230 would be. Turns out, it would actually be a very bad thing not just for freedom of expression online, but also for the president's personal political fortunes.</p><p>Despite all the confusion and obfuscation from critics, here is how Section 230 actually works. It gives all platforms and publishers alike liability protection for open platform content and allows leeway for moderation. For example, this applies to both Twitter and the New York Times. Legally speaking, a Twitter post\u2019s user is responsible for the content, not Twitter, the same is true in the comments sections of the New York Times. </p><p>However, for both publishers and platforms alike \u2014 Section 230 critics try to make a distinction here that doesn\u2019t actually exist in the law \u2014 they are legally responsible for whatever content they choose to publish. In the New York Times\u2019s case, that would be articles they edit and choose to print. </p><p>In Twitter\u2019s case, it would be the rare content they themselves publish, rather than simply provide a platform for. The information they recently published as a \u201cfact-check\u201d on one of Trump\u2019s tweets is one example. TweetTweetTweet</p><p>If Section 230 were \u201crevoked\u201d or \u201crepealed,\u201d social media platforms, such as Twitter, would no longer have any liability protection for the millions of statements published on their platform every day. Ironically, revoking this protection would almost certainly lead to more censorship, not less. </p><p>Now that they\u2019d be liable for all the content, platforms would probably have to preapprove posts and delete anything potentially legally problematic. This would mean they\u2019d have to actually start all-out censoring Trump \u2014 something they haven\u2019t done yet \u2014 because he sometimes shares potentially libelous falsehoods, such as spreading the debunked conspiracy theory that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough killed a former aide.</p><p>It\u2019s possible that without the liability shield provided by Section 230, Facebook and Twitter would have to delete Trump\u2019s account altogether to avoid putting themselves in grave legal jeopardy. </p><p>\u201cThe president is currently engaged in a campaign against an industry that helped his campaign,\u201d the Cato Institute\u2019s Mathew Feeney told me. \u201cThe irony is that absent Section 230's liability protects the president's Twitter account, and many others would be gone. Those wishing for less online conservative speech should be cheerleading for Section 230 reform.\u201d</p><p>Remember, Trump is widely successful on social media, with the ability to reach tens of millions regularly and spawn entire news cycles at whim. This was and is part of what allows him to get his political messaging out despite being reviled or at least disfavored by most of the political media. Only through social media platforms has Trump been able to get around the traditional gatekeepers that historically limited the rise of anti-establishment candidates.</p><p>So, the consequences of repealing Section 230 are clear. Conservatives should only be cheering along with Trump's regulatory efforts if they want him to deplatform himself inadvertently and sabotage his only reelection campaign. </p><p>Photo Caption:In separate tweets Thursday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump accused Karl Rove of making \"false statements\" both in print and on TV.

The video \u2014 featuring an ominous background music \u2014 showed a bunch of screenshots of the Google homepage on specific dates over the last seven years when former President Barack Obama and Trump delivered their State of the Union speeches to the Congress. Trump pinned the video, with the hashtag 'Stop The Bias.'The 24-second-long clip tried to drive the point home that while Google featured links to Obama's speeches on its homepage over the years, it stopped the tradition after Trump took office. </p><p>However, the information featured in the video was factually incorrect and hence the president's insinuation that Google was biased against him was misleading. Here are some fact-checks about the video on the supposed biasness of Google: Google's Response To President's Attack The multinational technology company claimed they did not feature the link in 2017 for Trump's speech to Congress just like they did not display a link for Obama's 2009 speech because both were simply addresses to Congress, rather than being State of the Union events. 'On Jan. 30 2018, we highlighted the live stream of President Trump's State of the Union on the google.com homepage. We have historically not promoted the first address to Congress by a new President, which is technically not a State of the Union address. As a result, we didn't include a promotion on google.com for this address in either 2009 or 2017,' Google said in a statement, Gizmodo[1]reported. Google Did Feature Link Of Trump's 2018 Speech Contrary to the claim made in the video pinned by Trump, Google said they had featured a link to the POTUS' 2018 State of the Union speech. To prove it, the tech mogul directed enquirers to a subreddit page run by the president's supporters, where a screenshot of the Google homepage from Jan. 30, 2018, was posted. In the screenshot was clearly visible a hyperlinked title reading, 'Live! Watch President Trump's State of the Union Address on YouTube.' Screenshot of Google homepage showing a link to President Donald Trump's State Of The Union speech from Jan. 30, 2018. Photo: Reddit The Video Maker Possibly Got Screenshots From Wayback Machine There is a high possibility that whoever made the video, obtained the screenshots from Wayback Machine[2], a digital archive of the World Wide Web and other information on the internet. However, the archive was not 100 percent accurate in storing records, especially when it came to keeping an account of Google Doodles and links to YouTube that sometimes featured on Google's homepage on specific days. According to Gizmodo, for example, a search for the date Jan. 29th, 2018, showed Google's homepage just having the company logo, while it actually featured a Google Doodle to commemorate singer Teresa Teng's 65th birthday. In another instance of discrepancy, the Google logo featured in the screenshot for Jan. 12, 2016, showed an outdated version of the company's emblem, which was changed in September 2015. Wayback Machine Confirmed Google's Homepage Did Feature Links To Trump's Speech Mark Graham, the director of Wayback Machine said while the archived links were a 'bit hard' to find, screenshots from the day of Trump's State of the Union speech did prove Google featured a link to the president's address on its homepage. Just a day before Trump pinned the inaccurate video on the top of his Twitter page, he launched another attack on Google: Paula Bolyard, supervising editor at PJ Media, wrote an opinion piece on theWashington Post,[3]saying president might have gotten the statistics from an article[4]she wrote Aug. 25, where she had mentioned what happened when she typed 'Trump' into the search engine's 'News' tab. She clarified despite her observation, which was in no way scientific, she firmly believed the internet should be free and the government regulating private tech companies to influence political opinion would set a dangerous precedent. 'Let me be clear: While suspicions about inherent biases being baked into the systems at Google and other tech platforms are certainly warranted, I do not believe that government regulations are the answer to that problem,' she wrote in the piece. President Donald Trump pinned a video about Google on the top of his Twitter page, Wednesday, which he claimed proved the search engine's bias toward conservatives.

But of course it was Trump. It was never going to be a dry, sober policy event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining him was a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/10/donald-trump-social-media-summit-conservative-activists\">constellation of people</url> from the world of the \"alt-right\", alternative media and conspiracy theorising.</p><p>This is a community that, born on the internet, is now feeling the squeeze from social-media companies</p><p>Step into this world, and there is a very different internet waiting to be found. It's one where members of the buzzing subreddit The_Donald call Trump \"daddy\" or GEOTUS - God Emperor of the United States. One that sees Hillary Clinton at the heart of a ring of satanic abusers. One that, in lots of different ways, is trying to throw off the influences of mainstream media, academic experts and the political establishment as so many yokes around the neck of the American people. Together, they are an angry, vibrant, technically skilled political base that has been dismissed as cranks and loons by every almost single mainstream politician, to their cost. The one exception is Trump.</p><p>He has given them interviews, feted them, and now invited them to the White House. But this is a strange, strained moment. They've been pulled into the centre of American political culture just as they've begun to be pushed out of the mainstream venues of online life. This is also a community that, born on the internet, only made possible through social media, is now feeling the squeeze from social-media companies. Many of their most prominent voices have been thrown off Twitter and Facebook, or had their revenues cut by YouTube. The_Donald itself has just been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/10/donald-trump-social-media-summit-conservative-activists\">placed under \"quarantine\"</url> by Reddit, where you have to click through warning pages to reach it. Even the algorithms, they complain, have been tweaked to stop their message being visible.</p><p>This kind of de-platforming has, in many cases, really hurt. The world of \"alt-tech\" that these people have been exiled to has nothing like the eyeballs and reach of the tech giants. After YouTube and Facebook banned Alex Jones for alleged hate speech, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/10/donald-trump-social-media-summit-conservative-activists\">New York Times reported</url> that his audience had fallen by nearly half. The summit was all about framing these removals as censorship, driven by the perceived liberal bias of the sunny, Californian, deep-blue world of big tech. A central right, they claim, is being undermined: free speech.</p><p>This is really a primal struggle for control of what the internet will look like. For \"free speech\" is now in direct conflict with another idea: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/10/donald-trump-social-media-summit-conservative-activists\">online harm</url>. The past decade has seen charities, political figures and researchers such as me point out that certain kinds of content on social media can be incredibly damaging - from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/10/donald-trump-social-media-summit-conservative-activists\">anti-vaxx</url> to hate speech and harassment. The basic freedom to say things online is now tangled up with the right to freedom from the harms that might come from it. This is a cultural war, and the content policies of the tech giants are absolutely at the heart of it.</p><p>Trump will push the tech giants, but he also needs them. He has no other way of bypassing the mainstream media or galvanising his support base. And whatever their liberal instincts, the tech giants also need him. They are companies, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/10/donald-trump-social-media-summit-conservative-activists\">fantastically profitable ones</url>. The looming threats of taxation and regulation mean they will continue to carefully walk a tightrope between expression and harm. It's rarely good business to directly take on an incumbent president.</p><p>Then there's also the issue for those such as me, and perhaps you, who have long worried that the tech giants cause harm precisely because they are not regulated. That they are over-mighty, out of control and shouldn't be making world-changing decisions about who can or can't be part of the public debate. But now, just as they begin to act on the many problems of online life, it is an entirely different kind of regulation - Trump's regulation - that might ruin it all.</p><p>This is an early skirmish in what is going to be a protracted, bruising, difficult struggle about the basic principles to govern online life. Expect no swift conclusions and many messy compromises.</p><p> Carl Miller is the author of The Death of the Gods: The New Global Power Grab</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-54426109</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-D7G1-JCJY-G4VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"711\"/><timeReceived>1:39 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

It's facing fines in the billions in the European Union for breaching antitrust laws and for rigging consumer choices in search results. Hundreds of its own staff are in revolt against a plan to re-enter China by recalibrating its search engine to meet mainland censorship laws. And, in one of his typical rage-tweeting sessions, US President Donald Trump singled out Google as being responsible for the bad press he is getting. He claimed the Google search for \"Trump News\" is \"RIGGED\", \"so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD\".</p><p/><p>Trump later broadened his attack to include Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies. White House officials such as economic adviser Larry Kudlow have threatened regulation, without providing details. In a time-honoured tradition, Trump is blaming the messenger for delivering the bad news. Even without news aggregators such as Google, it's almost certain that mainstream news outlets, the likes of The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, would still be turning out stories not to the president's liking.</p><p/><p>If it does go ahead with regulation, the Trump White House may be setting a bad precedent, not only at home but also abroad. What's to stop other powerful leaders and groups from demanding news aggregation to their own liking? In fact, industry direction is already moving in a way Trump would favour, even without regulation.</p><p/><p>The use of artificial intelligence is being pioneered by such tech giants as Google, Facebook and Spotify, the music service website that can guess your taste from past listening and offers new suggestions to you. Increasingly accurate profiles of our personal characteristics, tastes and preferences are being developed and automated by such tech companies. The current bias of Google news searches only seems to relate to the newness of stories or those that are trending, rather than following any overt political agenda.</p><p/><p>But news aggregators can easily deliver news and views that cater to the political beliefs of individuals, as Google does with consumer searches. News readers are, after all, just consumers of news, so why not give them what they want? Maybe before his presidency ends, Trump will be able to see only news that praises him to the sky.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-0d524dac-af35-11e8-b224-884456d4cde1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T5X-KTK1-JC8V-14YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"382\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 South China Morning Post Ltd.

It's facing fines in the billions in the European Union for breaching antitrust laws and for rigging consumer choices in search results. Hundreds of its own staff are in revolt against a plan to re-enter China by recalibrating its search engine to meet mainland censorship laws. And, in one of his typical rage-tweeting sessions, US President Donald Trump singled out Google as being responsible for the bad press he is getting. He claimed the Google search for \"Trump News\" is \"RIGGED\", \"so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD\". </p><p>Trump later broadened his attack to include Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies. White House officials such as economic adviser Larry Kudlow have threatened regulation, without providing details. In a time-honoured tradition, Trump is blaming the messenger for delivering the bad news. Even without news aggregators such as Google, it's almost certain that mainstream news outlets, the likes of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis> and CNN, would still be turning out stories not to the president's liking. </p><p>If it does go ahead with regulation, the Trump White House may be setting a bad precedent, not only at home but also abroad. What's to stop other powerful leaders and groups from demanding news aggregation to their own liking? In fact, industry direction is already moving in a way Trump would favour, even without regulation. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/2162143/donald-trump-claimed-googles-search-engine-rigged-what-do-we-really-know\">How Google's search engine works - Donald Trump take note</url></p><p>The use of artificial intelligence is being pioneered by such tech giants as Google, Facebook and Spotify, the music service website that can guess your taste from past listening and offers new suggestions to you. Increasingly accurate profiles of our personal characteristics, tastes and preferences are being developed and automated by such tech companies. The current bias of Google news searches only seems to relate to the newness of stories or those that are trending, rather than following any overt political agenda. </p><p>But news aggregators can easily deliver news and views that cater to the political beliefs of individuals, as Google does with consumer searches. News readers are, after all, just consumers of news, so why not give them what they want? Maybe before his presidency ends, Trump will be able to see only news that praises him to the sky. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2018. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

They're good people.</p><p>MURRAY: Trump's newly minted Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci, made no apologies for the President's behavior today, as he acknowledged that Trump probably wants Sessions to step aside.</p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT: I have an enormous amount of respect for the <person><nameText>attorney general, </nameText></person>but I do know the President pretty well, and if there's this level of tension in the relationship that's public, you're probably right. But I don't want to speak for the President on that, because he's a cabinet official, and I sort of think that has to be between the President of the United States and the cabinet official.</p><p>MURRAY: Sessions was once one of Trump's closest allies, and the first U.S. Senator to endorse Trump's Presidential bid.</p><p>SESSIONS: I am pleased to endorse <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for the presidency of the United States.</p><p>MURRAY: Now, the President's public flogging of his former friend isn't sitting well with other U.S. Senators. Republican Senators, including Rob Portman, Ted Cruz, and Lindsey Graham all leaped to Sessions' defense. In his statement, Graham called Sessions a rock solid conservative and shot back at Trump's criticism. Saying, President Trump's tweet today suggesting <person><nameText>Attorney General Sessions </nameText></person>pursue prosecution of a former political rival is highly inappropriate. Sara Murray, CNN, Youngstown, Ohio.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, joining us now for more: Talk Radio Host, Ethan; and California Republican National Committeeman, Shawn Steele. Thank you for coming in.</p><p>SOARES: Welcome, gentlemen.</p><p>[01:05:07] VAUSE: Shawn, first to you. The <person><nameText>attorney general, </nameText></person>we are hearing, refusing to stand down and refusing quit. The president, who made a fortune and made a career out of saying the words \"you're fired,\" doesn't seem to want to say that to <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions, </nameText></person>at least not yet. Does that now mean that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has to find another way, essentially, to fire the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, who's looking into the Russia (INAUDIBLE) between the other Trump campaign and the Kremlin. And is this a case of Mueller's getting too close to <person><nameText>Donald Trump?</nameText></person></p><p>SHAWN STEELE, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEEMAN: No. There are two things going on here, if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wanted Sessions fired, he'd be fired today immediately. He's not firing him; he's making a deliberate decision to kind of keep it up in the air. He surely is communicating a lot of displeasures with Sessions. I like <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions. </nameText></person>I think he's an honest and honorable guy, but I think he's also politically naive. By allowing the system to bring about a Robert Mueller, who is best friends with Comey, who's bringing all these henchmen to the prosecution; these guys are head hunters that are going after the President and his family personally. That's a big deal.</p><p>VAUSE: Ethan, leaders praised in public, criticized in private, is what I was always told.</p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN, TALK RADIO HOST: Well, this is -- first off, just because you're president doesn't mean you're a leader. Secondly, this is somebody who doesn't understand the rules of anything, which is what his supporters liked about him. They wanted him to turn everything upside down; that's what we're getting. And in this case, though, you actually said something, John, where you talked about <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions </nameText></person>continuing on and not quitting, which is exactly what \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\" portrayed him as with Kate, ask for his gum, and that is what is coming true.</p><p>SOARES: We have heard so much in the last couple of days about loyalty. It seems to be a hot topic in this administration. Of course, Sessions was the first to endorse President Trump. But since he's been dismissed by President Trump in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, this is what he said, \"When they say he endorsed me, I went to Alabama. I had 40,000 people. He was a Senator from Alabama. He looks at 40,000 people and he probably says, what do I have to lose and he endorsed me. So, it's like a great lawyer thing about the endorsement.\" Does he have a point?</p><p>BEARMAN: None, whatsoever. <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions </nameText></person>was already a very popular senator from Alabama, who could have stayed in his senate seat for eternity if he had wanted to. So, this is that strange ego that this president continues to exhibit. Kind of like saying things like, I could be the greatest president since the great late Abraham Lincoln. He could be, but he's not and he's not trying to be.</p><p>STEELE: Here's the problem. Trump is different, and a lot of the average main stream media types aren't happy with this. He's actually is unfiltered. He says what he wants to think. You don't have to guess. He's not playing a game here. He's actually telling people exactly what he -- how he views the world. And that really upsets the Washington class and upsets the establishment.</p><p>BEARMAN: It also upsets how our system works. It upsets our allies. It upsets now our justice system.</p><p>STEELE: No, no. That's just you.</p><p>VAUSE: It's not just the lame stream media that's upset -- let's see</p><p>STEELE: I didn't say that lame.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, I know. I know you're thinking it. So, it's OK. Look, here's the reaction from conservative media, so, if you don't like the Washington Post, CNN, New York Times, whatever -- this is Breitbart, OK, the alt-right Web site Breitbart. This is --</p><p>STEELE: Oh, it's right. That's a smear.</p><p>VAUSE: \"President Trump decision, Tuesday, to attack <person><nameText>Attorney General </nameText></person><person><nameText>Jeff Sessions </nameText></person>over Sessions' position on <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>various scandals only serves to highlight Trump's own hypocrisy on the issue,\" note the word hypocrisy, \"and is likely to fuel concerns from his base who see Sessions at the best hope to fulfill Trump's immigration policies.\" You know, Shawn that is a big slap from Breitbart. And you know what, they're not alone (INAUDIBLE). You know, a lot of conservative media outlets are very unhappy.</p><p>STEELE: And Ann Coulter, and Tucker Carlson, and a number of others. But Breitbart is divided. There've been other articles but this is the farthest. But the point is, you're right, among the conservative right, there's no such thing as an alt-right. That's completely thing that's made up by <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>and the other losers. The key is, there is an honest difference here, and I think there's a robust debate taking place, and I don't think that you're going to see Sessions is going to be thrown out or be fired because there'd too much of a blowback.</p><p>On the other hand, look at August, summer recess, Sessions resigns, you know what happens? What happens is that he gets to a point, his own <person><nameText>attorney general, </nameText></person>on an interim basis, until the end of Congress, for another year and a half. Now, that would be pretty exciting, and that maybe something that Sessions is may be considering. So, who knows? But that's just -- that's a very good speculation.</p><p>SOARES: Let me -- well, that's wonderful speculation. Let's talk a bit about what we heard from President Trump today, because he sounded rather presidential, putting free a presidential pitch today in Ohio. He defended his unconventional approach. But he also talked about some of his policies, immigration to be one of those. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[01:10:04] TRUMP: Earlier this year, immigration and customs enforcement conducted the largest single raid on transnational gangs in the history of our country. We are dismantling and destroying the blood thirsty criminal gangs, and well, I will just tell you this, we're not doing it in a politically correct fashion.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We're doing it rough. Our guys are rougher than their guy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Ethan, do you hear those cheers? I mean, that's not just Trump's base, that's Sessions' fans as well. And he had that territory staked out a long time before Trump came along.</p><p>BEARMAN: Yes, that's absolutely right. And what's just really upsetting is the term \"and we're tougher than the other guys.\" We have the rule of law in this country. We have laws about how law enforcement, immigration enforcement is supposed to actually occur, how you treat other people. There's case precedent on this, let alone the Constitution. It is wrong, and actually what has come about here in California is an actual deportation force, which they continue to deny. But 15,000 new agents grabbing people when they're dropping kids off at school, tearing families apart. It is not at all just focused on the gangs. I'm all for getting rid of the gangs, all for it, but that's not just what is happening.</p><p>STEELE: Of course, that's completely untrue. You don't care about the gangs. You don't care about illegals.</p><p>BEARMAN: Of course, I do.</p><p>STEELE: You don't care about the criminality.</p><p>BEARMAN: Talked about it in the news.</p><p>STEELE: And the majority of Americans are upset with the thousands -- millions of people that have come into this country, jumping the line, many of them criminals, and no action, no enforcement, and the Obama administration telling the immigration authorities to stand down.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BEARMAN: Why did he appoint Governor Rick Perry when he was governor of Texas, do nothing about immigration because he just wanted those workers to that absolutely are terrible.</p><p>STEELE: He's -- that's not true. (INAUDIBLE). He had no patrol over immigration. This is a typical liberal excuse.</p><p>VAUSE: We always get into this argument with you guys on immigration. But listen, but the point is that, you know, Trump campaign, a lot of Sessions' strong points, the stuff that makes Sessions popular makes <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>very popular. This is where the political problems come along. There are also the political problems to <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>when it comes to the issue of loyalty.</p><p>This is a man, who demands loyalty from those around him, but a lot of Republican lawmakers, especially while they're trying to get this very difficult health bill plan through the Senate, they are looking, does the person we'll ask into question, does <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>have my back? If <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions </nameText></person>is on thin ice, Mr. Loyalty from the beginning, what's he going to do for me? And Shawn, that's one of the reasons why this motion today, barely passed by one vote with Mike Pence, the Vice President, coming in as the tiebreaker, just to start the debate on the Senate out there.</p><p>STEELE: It was supposed to lose. It was actually quite a stunning victory because most of the media thought it was going to lose, it wasn't going anywhere, Republicans were going to desert to Republicans who are going to vote against it. Not true, not true, fake news. The key is with Sessions, he uncorked the Genie from the bottle that created the special prosecutor monster. And I don't like any of them, Republicans special prosecutors, Democratic special prosecutors always ends in a witch hunt that has way too much power, it's unaccountable. And Sessions did it on his watch, and it's a terrible thing.</p><p>SOARES: Well, today we saw Senator <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>return to the Senate. He got a standing ovation, and he was pretty scathing today when he spoke. Let's take a listen to what he says.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN </nameText></person>(R), ARIZONA: I hope they again can rely on humility on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other, to learn how to trust each other again, and by so doing better, serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loud mouths on the radio and television and the internet -- to hell with them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: He also said whether or not we are the same party, we're not the president's subordinates; we are his equal. So, a very powerful, not only not observing to protest (INAUDIBLE), but also calling for bipartisanship. What did you make of it?</p><p>BEARMAN: Well, <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>definitely talks a good game, and he is a true war hero, unlike what now President Trump said during the campaign when he said he wasn't a war hero because he got shot down. It was really despicable when the President said that during the campaign. <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>speaks the truth. We have three equal branches here in the government, in the United States. That's how we're set up. So, absolutely, the Senate has every right to not do what the president wants us to do.</p><p>SOARES: But they're like schoolchildren just bickering over this.</p><p>STEELE: <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>proved that he's a real hero again. He has a life threatening problem, was probably incurable cancer to the brain that shows up, and nobody expects him to show up. I have great respect for him. And he came here to support the president's agenda. That's also something that a lot of Democrats don't want to mention. But he mentioned something very serious about bombastic radio personalities, and I'm here to tell you: I don't think it's Ethan.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VAUSE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>STEELE: But I'm not a radio personality.</p><p>VAUSE: You are on T.V., and you do have a vote for that.</p><p>STEELE: Thank you so much.</p><p>SOARES: On that note, we'll leave it. Thank you very much.</p><p>[01:15:04] VAUSE: Thanks, guys. Well, the U.S. House has overwhelmingly passed a bill that includes new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The vote came the same day Pyongyang ramped up its nuclear threats against the United States. CNN's Will Ripley joins us from Seoul, South Korea. And Matt Rivers is also joining us live there in Beijing. Will, first to you. These U.S. sanctions, they still have to get through the Senate. But to the North Koreans, the anger and focus seems to be on comments which came from the CIA Director Mike Pompeo.</p><p>[01:15:35] WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. North Korea is used to sanctions. There have been six rounds that have done little to slow their nuclear and missile programs. But Mike Pompeo was implying that the United States is looking for regime change in North Korea, saying that the North Korean people would love it if Kim Jong-un, their supreme leader went away, saying the United States would like to separate Kim from his growing nuclear arsenal. Pyongyang predictably responded with a threat of a preemptive nuclear attack against the United States. But these remarks are surprising considering here in South Korea, President Moon Jae-in said that regime change is not South Korea's goal and in April, Rex Tillerson said regime change is not something the United States is after. Although I was in North Korea at that time, and they didn't believe it for one second, certainly these remarks from the CIA Director just back up North Korea's belief they have to keep developing these weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>VAUSE: Will, thank you. To Matt in Beijing, who has seen the government there making the place for a potential conflict between North Korea and the United States.</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It does appear that way. There's been some reports published for the people's liberation army here in China that suggested the creation of a new border defense brigade that is in charge of patrolling the border and also gathering intelligence along presumably would be the North Korean border. There was also another report issued that talked about the installation of 24-hour video surveillance along that border. This is an 880 or so long border. It's very porous and rural. It's hard to access in some places. So the fact that China does appear, if you want to put 24- hour surveillance at that border, you're going to need to commit the resources to do that. So it does appear with the creation of this brigade, China is looking at the ongoing situation, recognizing a tense reality. And apparently reacting as they see fit.</p><p>VAUSE: Matt, thank you. Matt Rivers live in Beijing and Will Ripley live in Seoul.</p><p>SOARES: Coming up, a top adviser to <person><nameText>Pope Francis </nameText></person>appears in an Australian court, facing multiple charges of historical sexual assault offenses.</p><p>VAUSE: Also this hour, a lot of new information about American football brain damage, and the reason researchers say athletes are at risk.</p><p>[01:20:18] VAUSE: A close adviser to <person><nameText>Pope Francis </nameText></person>plans to plead not guilty to multiple charges of historical sexual assault offenses. Cardinal George Pell appeared before a magistrate just a few hours ago.</p><p>SOARES: He's been given a leave of his post from the Vatican to fight the charges. CNN's Anna Coren joins us from Melbourne, Australia. What did the cardinal have to say?</p><p>ANA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the cardinal had nothing to say. He remained very silent as he walked from his lawyer's offices about 100 meters from where I am, through an incredible media scrum, something that cameramen and journalists here in Australia have never witnessed before. He walked flanked by police into court where he went through security, was taken away to a private room where he had private meetings. He then appeared before the court. This was a preliminary routine hearing which he didn't have to attend. But you have to remember, this is the cardinal, as you say, one of <person><nameText>Pope Francis's </nameText></person>closest advisers. He is a Secretary to the Economy at the Vatican that means he's in charge of the Vatican's finances. He's on an advisory board for the pope, which deals with things hike something like sexual abuse. This is the third most powerful man in the Vatican. So he was always going to attend today after he was charged with those multiple historical sexual assault offenses. Police have not gone into the charges. We don't have details of the charges or the alleged victims due to legal reasons. But at the time, certainly Cardinal Pell said that he was looking forward to this day in court to clear his name. He said he was innocent and that he finds sexual assault, sexual abuse abhorrent. So to see him walk up the stairs here, surrounded by dozens of journalists and photographers, and really had to endure very rough treatment, it was quite extraordinary.</p><p>SOARES: Yes. The next hearing is October 6th. Anna Coren, thank you very much. Good to see you.</p><p>VAUSE: Another legal hurdle for the family of Charlie Gard asking a U.K. court to bring their son home to die. They decided to take their baby off life support. The court has given the family until noon Wednesday to find a willing medical practitioner to oversee the death.</p><p>SOARES: Researchers have examined the brains of football players and found CTE in 177 cases. What's even more alarming, of the 111 former NFL players examined, all but one had to the disease. It leads to memory loss as well as aggression. Here's CNN's Sanjay Gupta with more.</p><p>SANJAY GUPTA, CNN MEDICAL CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: There are no questions that it's concerning. You hear 99 percent of professional football players have evidence of this CTE, and what I would tell you is that it is concerning. This is the largest study that's been done and looked at lots of players. But one thing I want to make a little context here. When a study like this is performed, there may be people who are concerned that they have symptoms, and as a result, they go to their doctors and get their brains examined after they die. So it's what they call a selected group here. So they're more likely to have actually had CTE but even with that, even if you say OK, well, there are a lot of players out there totally fine, never have a problem. Even if every other mare in the NFL did not have CTE, this would still be a significant number, 110 players who do have evidence of this. We know more about this disease than ever before. We know what causes it, repetitive blows to the head, and we know it can lead to all these mood problems and shortened life in many players as well. So something we're definitely going to keep following.</p><p>SOARES: Let's have more on this story. Anthony, thank you very much for coming in to talk to us about this. I wanted to get your take first on this report. What does it actually mean for the players that you represented, the stories that you've heard?</p><p>[01:25:15] ANTHONY TALL, FOUNDER, ASPIRE SPORTS GROUP: I think it's very, very -- I think it's going to be a very detrimental blow to the brand of the NFL. This will affect players on the pop warner level, players in college and a lot of soccer moms aren't going to want their kids playing football anymore. Once we see the numbers, how staggering the numbers are, it kind of sets up a possibility where the NFL brand could be permanently damaged. So I think that's what pops out to me.</p><p>VAUSE: We go to the study. Whether or not it is, you know, what it means legally, the criticism is that the study was limited, that the brains were donated from concerned family members, it wasn't a random study. So it's kind of skewed and it's circumstantial evidence. it seems overwhelming circumstantial evidence, but still circumstantial.</p><p>TALL: I think because of the numbers that they're so dramatic here, 99 -- 110 out of 111, it's hard to argue it's circumstantial. We have direct evidence. This is going all the way back to players who played -- I mean players that played in high school, they found symptoms of CTE that will probably come about later on in their lifetime. So with that being so prevalent, I think it's more direct evidence.</p><p>SOARES: In 2016, the NFL acknowledged a connection between football and CTE. So hearing this now from NFL, how do you feel? I want to get a sense from your clients, people you represent, how worried are they about this?</p><p>TALL: Well, I think they're very worried about it. From athletes I've represented, they're very worried, because a lot of them have been playing for years. That statement by the NFL is a statement that you would expect, because it's leaving open the argument that they could come back later and say well, it's not 100 percent that those head traumas are the cause of CTE. Now that the evidence is so overwhelming, it's devastating from talking to players, and players that I've worked with, they're very worried about it, and it's going to have a strong effect on the league.</p><p>VAUSE: The NFL puts up over $100 million for research related to concussion and injuries. That seems to be chump change for the world's richest sporting franchise, last year, $12 billion. I mean, I guess the question here is, are they doing enough, including they need to do a lot more?</p><p>TALL: No, they're not. The NFL is an owner's league. What I mean by that is the owners run the league. The NBA and major league baseball are a players league. That's guaranteed contracts with major league baseball and the national basketball association. NFL, there's no guaranteed contracts. So that same psychology and mentality went into this settlement. The judge had to reverse this or at least have them go back and get more, because she even thought it was too small of a settlement. Remember, a lot of the lawyer fees ate up a lot of that money.</p><p>SOARES: We'll see if it hurts the NFL and the allure of the NFL, the mothers putting their children through this, we'll see.</p><p>TALL: Yes. That's something we'll have to see as time goes by. I know the NFL is trying to teach safety in terms of like you were just saying on the younger age. I think because this study is so profound, and because the numbers are so staggering, I think this is a very big blow to the brand of the NFL. VAUSE: And there are other concerns about hockey and other sports too which have big hit injuries, too. So this isn't just about football. Anthony, thanks for coming in.</p><p>SOARES: Thank you very much.</p><p>TALL: Thank you.</p><p>[01:30:04] JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANHOR: We'll take a short break.

He's trying to make <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>He's trying to make America great again.</p><p>on camera): So, you think that it would help him when we stay on trouble is you get rid of the special council.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If it helps to stay out of trouble, yes.</p><p>(voice-over): And what if the president gets into increasing trouble?</p><p>(on camera): <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>would be allowed to pardon himself, can he be getting legal or have to go trouble, do you think he should pardon himself?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. I don't that that's the case. And I don't think that he should do that actually.</p><p>(on camera): You know, that was case.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. He shouldn't pardon himself.</p><p>(voice-over): But most people we talk to do not agree because they believe in hope it will stay a more point.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He doesn't need to pardon himself. There's nothing to find him guilty on.</p><p>(voice-over): <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>most fervent supporters, staying loyal.</p><p>Gary Tuchman, CNN, Youngstown, Ohio.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was once described as the greatest friend of scouting movement ever had in the House. And 1933, he became the first and only U.S. president, he inducted into the scouts Order of the Arrow recognizing his commitment to his best and to his duty for God and country.</p><p>During his accepted speech he referred to the NRA which is not the National Rifle Association but back then the NRA was the National Recovery Administration. A key part of his new deal program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: You come right down to it, the NRA is based on the same fundamentals that scouting is based on. In other words, trying to do something for the other fellow and not trying to do something. It's based on cooperation, you know, what that means. It is based on the spirit of service. And it is going to work just like scouting has worked.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, for the time perhaps maybe that could be considered a little political. Four years later, when the Boy Scouts of America held their very first national jamboree and FDR made an appearance, he handed out an eagle badge, he post photographs and did not talk politics, a petition which lasted for 80 years until now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Do you want to achieve your dreams, I said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when I'm in front of the boy scouts. We ought to change it from the word swamp to the word cesspool of perhaps to the word sewer. But it's not good. Not good.</p><p>Did President Obama ever come to a jamboree? Do you remember that incredible night with the maps, and the Republicans are red, and the Democrats are blue and that map was so red it was unbelievable. And, you know, we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. Popular vote is much easier.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Just part of a speech by President Trump which been why they criticized from many of the parents of the scouts, from politicians as well as commentators. Here's part of what Tom Eblen at the Lexington Herald-Leader brought.</p><p>Rather than try to inspire patriotism and high ideals in these impressionable teenaged boys excited about seeing an American president, Trump treated them like just another group of fans at one of his Nuremberg-style campaign rallies.</p><p>And Tom Eblen joins us now from Lexington, Kentucky. And Eblen, thanks for being with us. And just by a way of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: -- you and your family, you have a very long history with the Boy Scouts of America.</p><p>[01:40:00] TOM EBLEN, COLUMNIST, LEXINGTON HERALD-LEADER: Yes. I'm an eagle scout. My three younger brothers are real -- all eagle scouts. And our father was a scout master for many years.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. So you have a dog in this fight as they say.</p><p>EBLEN: Absolutely, John.</p><p>VAUSE: -- think back at what President Trump said during that speech from your point of view, what was the lowest point?</p><p>EBLEN: That's hard to say. There were so many low points. I just thought the entire speech was completely inappropriate. But for the scouts or for any group of young people.</p><p>VAUSE: You know, at one point, the crowd, they started chanting, we love Trump. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CROWD: We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You say and you commented the Boy Scouts of America must denounce the speech or just rename the organization Trump youth that clearly is a very loaded statement with over turning to Nazi Germany, is that what you were hinting at?</p><p>EBLEN: Yes. I was just really outraged. I thought not only at what the president said but at the reaction. I don't see much blame in the boys because boys will be boys. But I just thought that the leaders, you know, it's like going to -- could've done anything, should have stopped some of that reaction. But I just really think it's incumbent on the boy scouts now to reject, you know, what the president said, the way the scouts behaved and just make it clear that these kind of comments, this kind of behavior does not live up to the organizations ideals. The scouts have always been about good character. And this was not good character.</p><p>VAUSE: You put a good deal of blame on the organization for this. I agree that they should have expected a speech like this from a president like this. Is it realistic though for the organization to have not invited Mr. Trump, after all he is the president of the United State?</p><p>EBLEN: You know, I think it was fine to invite him. What I meant was, that they should've been ready to do some damage control because they have expected that something would happen. And it was almost 24- hours later before they issued a statement which frankly was very lame.</p><p>VAUSE: Specifically, what would you like to see the Boy Scouts of America do right now with regards to the speech?</p><p>EBLEN: I think they should make a statement that the president's first in political remarks and behavior was inappropriate. And I think they should regret the audience actions, some of the chance and some of the -- doing President Obama. I just think, you know, the organization needs to stand up and say, this is not what we are about, you know, we expect a better behavior from the president and better behavior from our members.</p><p>VAUSE: Do you believe that President Trump was where the controversy of the speech would cause? Many have argued on his offense. He's not your typical politician.</p><p>EBLEN: Well, I'm never sure what he's aware off. But, you know, he doesn't really seemed to regulate his behavior very well. So, it's kind of hard to say.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Tom, we'll leave it there. But we have very interesting commentary and it's a very interesting points you make in that right. So, thanks for being with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>EBLEN: All right, thank you, John.</p><p>SOARES: Now, still ahead a brick kilns workers in Cambodia pay just fractions of a cent. And CNN's Freedom Project, we'll speak to labors who say its impossible pay off their debt with such neither way. She's going to bring that story next.</p><p>[01:45:48] SOARES: Now, all this week as CNN Freedom Project is investigating and exposing the use of children and bondage labors in the brick kilns of Cambodia.</p><p>VAUSE: Construction is powering Cambodia's Burma economy. But there are concerns that build on the back of child slave labor in particular at brick making factories.</p><p>CNN's Alexandra Field reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is what progress looks like. Cambodia is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. Construction is booming making brick kilns one of the country's largest economic sectors.</p><p>It all starts here in the factories, largely outside the capital Phnom Penh where life looks very different. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I hope that the brick kiln known, it close this kiln when they run out of clay so I can get rid of the debt and stop working here.</p><p>(voice-over): Conditions are tough. Toilets are rare, so as running water. Entire families live right here at the factories. The work is seasonal. And some of the workers have to return most of the meeker wages they earn.</p><p>(on camera): Every worker we talked to tells us that they owe the factory owner money either a thousand dollar sometimes even a few thousand dollars. It's money that they borrowed to pay for medical expenses, for funerals, to support their children or sometimes to pay up higher interest loans. In order to pay down this debt, they come to work here in the brick kilns.</p><p>(voice-over): In a scathing report a Cambodian NGO Ricardo (ph), said the wide spread practice amounts to debt bondage, a form of modern day slavery, illegal under Cambodian law.</p><p>The Cambodian Labor Ministry disputes those findings. They say the kilns are closely inspected and that they haven't found any cases of debt bondage.</p><p>CHAN NARY, OWNER, BRINK KILN (through translator): All of my workers owe me money, not some of them but all of them.</p><p>(voice-over): A factory owner we speak on the outskirts of Phnom Penh says it's just in advance loan is being worked off.</p><p>NARY (through translator): And a lot of here are good because the bills are put on me. When they give birth we pay. When they get married, we also pay. So their debts increase because they barrow our money.</p><p>(voice-over): She says she pays her workers three Cambodian riels per brick a fraction of a fraction of a cent. At other kilns labor say it's impossible to pay off what they owe with the wages they earn.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We have to work here for our whole lives because we borrowed money from the kiln owner. And we have nothing to reduce the debt.</p><p>(voice-over): A cycle they say they're trapped in where they have to borrow more just for basics, when the debt grows some become desperate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): All my children started working since they were very small like this one. They all have to work. This little one helps to carry the bricks.</p><p>(voice-over): We meet whole families who say everyone must pitch in. Adults who tells us, they'll never pay off that they owe, they fear, they'll pass it on.</p><p>Alexandra Field, CNN, Phnom Penh. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Well, tomorrow, the CNN Freedom Project will introduce you to a young survivor of child labor of Cambodian brick kilns, take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FIELD (voice-over): Pew Chan Teng (ph) is 16 and only in first grade. But his teachers believe in him. He has done harder work.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): When I was 11, I started working at the brick kiln. It was very difficult. I loaded bricks on the cart and then I pull the cart from the brick to dry. But one day, when I was putting clay in machine I slipped and arm got caught in the engine.</p><p>(voice-over): Chan Teng (ph) was 14. And his mother says, she was in debt to a brick factory owner. The whole family was making bricks to pay it off.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[01:49:39] VAUSE: And we'll have much more on this story as well as the problem on child labor at Cambodia's brick factories, that's tomorrow only on CNN. We will be right back in just a moment.</p><p>SOARES: Well, it turns out your vacuum could be doing more than just sweeping up dust bunnies. High end models of the Roomba robotic vacuum are also creating a detailed floor mat of your home.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. Dust isn't the only thing Roobie (ph) the robot is sucking up alone. The company's CEO wants to tell all that data, the big tech companies like Google, Amazon or Apple. Don't worry he says, it's just to make your home a better place. Some might agree, some concerns about privacy and other legal issues.</p><p>SOARES: Now, the idea of artificial intelligence had long been a subject of science fictions, you know.</p><p>VAUSE: Terminator movie filmed it all out for a Sky net, who come alive, we get stealth weather robots will come, they'll all be destroyed. Well, maybe who say they're going up.</p><p>Anyway the debate over artificial intelligence whether it's good, whether it's bad, it's actually playing out in real life. It's being two of the biggest names in tech against each other SpaceX founder, <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>recently won that A.I. could friend to mankind.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>ELON MUSK, </nameText></person>FOUNDER AND CEO, SPACEX: I think people should be really concerned about it. I keep sounding the alarm bell but, you know, until people see like robots going down the street killing people like, they don't know how to react. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Well, Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>instead believes artificial intelligence could be a force to go. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG, </nameText></person>CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, FACEBOOK: With A.I. especially, I'm really optimistic and I think that people who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are -- I just -- I don't understand it. I think it's really negative. And in some ways I actually think it's pretty irresponsible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Musk, shout back with the tweet saying, I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.\"</p><p>SOARES: Well, joining us now to discuss this Richard Korf, the professor of computer science at the University of California, Los Angeles. Richard this is a very public spot, a very intelligent one at two. Let me get your take who's side are you on, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>or Musk's?</p><p>RICHARD KORF, COMPUTER SCIENCE PROFESSOR, UCLA: I'm probably not on either person side. I think they both have points to be made. I'm probably closer to <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>and more of an optimist. Any new technology is going to have enormous benefits. It's also going to have enormous detriments. And we need to pay attention to both of those.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Let's just back a little bit because when we're talking about artificial intelligence, you know, are we talking about like Hal in Space Odyssey 2001? Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Open the pod bay door, Hal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Basically the machines are going to kill us all. And take over the world. Are talking about like an algorithm that will make have been a latte.</p><p>KORF: I think we're going to, I don't think Hal is where we're going to see I.A. in that particular form. But I think we're going to see artificial intelligence embedded and probably one of my favorite example is self-driving cars. And this is something that's absolutely going to come. It's going to come the next five or 10 years.</p><p>And there is enormous benefit to such a thing. It's an A.I. over million people, you know, are killed than motor vehicle accidents. Ninety percent of motor vehicle accidents are caused by human error. Those kinds of errors most of them are not going to be made by machines. And so, the potential benefit of that one certainly is we're going to have drastically reduce fatalities and casualties on the road. But also we're going to have tremendous benefits in terms of fuel economy, road congestion, self-driving cars can be closer together both sideways --</p><p>[01:55:02] VAUSE: Then millions of people will lose a job.</p><p>KORF: People looses jobs has happened in the industrial evolution. We also need to worry about these technologies being safe with any new technology, you have to worry about. This is a computer technology. You need to worry about things being correct. You need to worry about bugs. There's going to be bugs in these things. A bug in your computer which cause your machine to crash, cause the machine to crash, it may loose some data or something.</p><p>A bug in a self-driving car or an 18 wheel truck can be much bigger deal. Security is also very important.</p><p>SOARES: Yes.</p><p>KORF: The self driving car manufacturer like Tesla would like to be able to download new versions of their software into all of their cars on the road.</p><p>A hacker or malicious hacker would like to be able to download their own version of this, OK, in enormous numbers of vehicles. And so we need to worry about -- we need to worry about correctness. We need to worry about security. And there's going to be trade offs cost and benefits both.</p><p>SOARES: Richard when I was listening to both of their sides <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Musk, I was is trying to decide which side I would agree with, you know, would that be can slightly more alarmed doomsday scenario or more with <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>optimistic. In many ways, you pointed that they're both right. But, you know, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is slightly more open and more entrepreneurial where Musk is looking further ahead.</p><p>So, is one just a long term short plan is to how they're seeing it. In part, they both -- are they both right in that regard?</p><p>KORF: I think they're both right to some extent. I mean I would say that neither of them or A.I. professionals so they are not the top experts in the field, they're both involved in, they both know a lot about it. But they are not people working it. People who are working it, my colleagues are not as concerned. I think there's a perception on the part of the public when <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>talks about or Steven Hawking talks about robots taking over the world and destroying. There's some now. It could have become conscious and they're going to maliciously on their own decide to take over the world. And I think it's very unlikely.</p><p>SOARES: Yes. I was going to say, it's very unlikely. But we just don't know that.</p><p>KORF: We don't know for sure.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>KORF: Maybe they'll keep us as pets if we're lucky.</p><p>VAUSE: Richard if you talk about artificial intelligence are the threat, are we greater threat now from like real life unintelligence and the decisions that may, you know, governments and leaders are making for the planet much more so that artificial intelligence.</p><p>KORF: There's lot of things that I worry about a lot more than an A.I. I worry about nuclear weapons. I worry about global warming. There's lots of problems. And, you know, we're just used to fallibility. We're used to car crashes. We're used to 35,000 people in United States over a million year being killed. And I tell my students, I said, I tell them, your kids are going to look at you and they're going to say seriously, you let random people who are half asleep, who are drunk operate one ton machine at 70 miles an hour within a few feet of each other, what were you thinking. What were you thinking?</p><p>VAUSE: Professor, good to see you.</p><p>SOARES: Thank you very much.</p><p>KORF: Thanks for having me.</p><p>SOARES: You're having watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm Isa Soares.</p><p>VAUSE: I'm John Vause. A lot more news after a very short break.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2017072618CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P3W-KJG1-JB20-G528-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 26, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>OR0001L1D</classCode><className>NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

I can do it with an executive order.'He initially claimed that TikTok could be gone by the following morning, though he has since backed off that threat now that Microsoft has stepped in to potentially purchase the company. But even for an administration that has played fast and loose[1] with the Law of the Land since entering office, Trump's threat to ban the Chinese-owned social media app unless its North American operations were sold to a US-based corporation has left the public stunned with many asking, 'wait, he can actually do that?' The answer to that question is a resounding, 'well, it's complicated.' </p><p>But before we jump into that legal briar patch, let's take a quick look at the company that has so effectively managed to raise the president's ire. If you don't know what TikTok is, go ask literally anybody under the age of 30. The short-form, video-based website is a social media juggernaut. It pales against Facebook or Twitter in terms of monthly active users but TikTok still commands an estimated 70 million users in the US[2] (and around 800 million worldwide). It's owned by ByteDance, a Beijing-based company founded in 2012.TikTok was launched internationally in 2017, a year after the Chinese-market version (dubbed Douyin) went live, though the app didn't make it state-side until after ByteDance merged with Musical.ly in 2018. But when TikTok did hit, it hit hard, quickly becoming one of the most downloaded apps in both the American iOS and Android stores. Despite its popularity, TikTok has repeatedly run afoul of concerns regarding its vast user data harvesting efforts. Most people think of TikTok as a silly dancing video app, Dr. Karen North, Director of the Annenberg Program on Online Communities at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, told Engadget. However, 'the reality is that TikTok was engineered in a way that makes it just a phenomenal data collection tool.''Not only is it built in a way that allows it to collect amazing data but it appeals to a very sought after demographic: young people who are just starting into having buying power,' she continued. North also notes that since many people today use their real names and real contact information when registering for the app, the data harvested from them will likely influence marketing and advertising efforts against them for years to come.The reason that ByteDance has different versions of the same app for the Chinese and American markets is due to the two countries' differing legal structures. Douyin, for example, has data flow back to different servers than TikTok data does in order to comply with China's censorship requirements. ByteDance claims that TikTok is not available in China and that data collected from it is stored outside the country, the app's terms of service do reserve the right to share any information with Chinese authorities[3]. In short, the app's competing dual natures have become untenable.'There are different laws in China than there are in the United States,' North said. 'They're not just different, they're in conflict with each other. Those are laws that involve data privacy. And eventually it wasn't gonna work, even though people are -- for the fun of dancing a TikTok dance -- willing to give away their privacy.' Those privacy concerns have grown into calls for investigation since January 2019 when American think tank, the Peterson Institute for International Economics[4], described TikTok as a \"Huawei-sized problem.\" Since then, TikTok has been the subject of multiple Senate committee investigations as well as by the US Treasury's CFIUS[5].So, on the surface at least, Trump's authority to 'ban' TikTok (he never actually explained what that would entail) on national security and data privacy grounds is somewhat established. The National Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977[6], for example, enables a president to declare a national emergency and drastically expand the executive branch's power, Dr. Nikolas Guggenberger, Executive Director of Information Society Project at Yale Law School, noted to Engadget. As too does the National Security Act[7] of 1947. He also points out that the Federal government has previously taken action against foreign owners of US apps when, earlier this year, it forced a Chinese company which had bought Grindr[8] 2018 to sell its 98 percent stake in the app to a US venture capital firm.This is not a new tactic for the Trump administration. It has previously leveraged bans -- and the threat of invoking them -- as cudgels for negotiation against both Huawei[9] and ZTE[10]. In May of last year, Trump declared a 'national emergency'[11] as pretext for banning Huawei products, though he eased parts of that trade ban in June[12] following a 'truce' with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Huawei has since sued the US, claiming that the trade ban is unfair and incorrect[13].But in the end, it may not even really matter if Trump technically has the authority to ban an app from the US via executive order, Guggenberger argues. 'There's a legally sound way to do things and there is a way of doing things and still influencing the course of the development,' he said. In this case, Trump doesn't even actually need to officially ban the app. The mere threat, when uttered from the Oval Office, is credible enough to pressure the situation into an outcome benefitting the president's position.The timing of Trump's crusade against TikTok has also raised questions regarding his real motivations. Numerous outlets including NBC News[14], Forbes[15] and Mother Jones[16] have all noted that Trump's July 31st threat came just over a month after his Tulsa, Oklahoma campaign rally. That rally was the first held since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and was kind of a big deal[17] to the president. In the weeks running up to the June 20 event, the Trump campaign team proudly crowed about the massive amount of RSVPs it had received for the event -- reportedly numbering more than a million. Over 1M ticket requests for the @realDonaldTrump[18] #MAGA[19] Rally in Tulsa on Saturday.Before  entering each guest will get:Temperature check Hand sanitizer MaskThere will be precautions for the heat and bottled water as well. \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) June 15, 2020[20] The actual turnout to the event was 6,200, per ticket scans conducted by the Tulsa Fire Department and fire marshal. TikTok users from around the world claimed to have coordinated to game the Trump campaign's RSVP system[21], flooding it with bunk email addresses and convincing then-campaign manager Brad Parscale that the rally would be an overwhelming success. Parscale was demoted from his position[22] in the campaign shortly thereafter.Both  North and Guggenberger brought up the Tulsa rally -- individually and without prompting -- during our conversations. North notes that 'If I were in the federal government, I could probably come up with excuses to claim that [banning TikTok] is a homeland security issue. But, of course, is it [also] a political battle between Donald Trump, China and TikTok because of Tulsa? That all muddies the waters in a situation where there's legitimate privacy concerns.'Guggenberger expressed concern for the First Amendment implications of banning the app. 'Shutting down TikTok as a medium does chill free speech in an area that is a crucial tool for young Americans to express themselves and [you could see] how impactful it is -- whether you agree with what happened or not -- in Tulsa,' he said.Presidential pettiness aside, Trump's actions against TikTok are only the latest in a series of attacks aimed at social media companies and how they are regulated. In May, following Twitter's decision to add fact-checking banners[23] to Trump's disingenuous tweets, the president took a swing[24] at Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996[25]. That section states, \"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" Essentially, it indemnifies social sites like Twitter, Facebook and TikTok from being held liable for content posted by their users.'It's unclear what to make of this because, to a certain extent, you can't just issue an executive order and overturn on a whim 25 years of judicial precedent about how a law is interpreted,' Kate Klonick, law professor at St. John's University, told the NYT[26].Trump's executive order on the matter, 'was clearly garbage on substance,' Guggenberger declared. 'But again the question is, 'does it really matter and to what extent can you make policy based on garbage orders?' The executive order back in May regarding section 230, if you looked at it closely, it had barely any content.'The executive order[27] did little more than direct executive agencies to review their ad spending on online platforms and demand that the DOJ 'establish a working group regarding the potential enforcement of State statutes that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices.' The order lacked teeth, so to speak.'And yet the discussion around it,' Guggenberger continued, 'and the pressure that it puts on social media companies that have been attacked, does shape public discourse. It does distract from the egregious failures of the administration in other instances.'Speaking of egregious failures, Trump compounded his ban threat on Monday[28] by asserting that the US Treasury should be compensated for its role in 'facilitating' Microsoft's potential purchase of TikTok's US operations. 'It's a little bit like the landlord/tenant; without a lease the tenant has nothing, so they pay what's called 'key money,' or they pay something,' Trump told reporters[29] during a press event at the White House. 'But the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money, because without the United States they don't have anything, at least having to do with the 30 percent [Microsoft had been considering purchasing a 30 percent stake in the company rather than buying it outright].'Guggenberger wouldn't go so far as to characterize it as extortion outright, 'I'm not entirely sure whether there's not some sort of tax levy that the administration can impose on sales by foreign investors to American companies,' he admitted. 'That is something I simply don't know.''What's appalling is the bundling,' he countered. 'Even if there were some sort of toll or some sort of tax that they could levy on the transaction, bundling that to a threat to ban something, then nudging a US company into buying the foreign entity, and then levying a tax even if you found a legal basis for doing so, bundling that is beyond anything that's even halfway legally sound.'Despite this situation's legally ambiguous nature, the parties directly involved all have something to gain from the transaction's eventual success. Trump can play up his reputation as being a 'master negotiator' ahead of the November elections should the sale go through while TikTok will be able to continue its operations beyond the illuminating glare of multiple congressional investigations. But the biggest winner in this situation is clearly Microsoft.As North explains, Microsoft is one of the most dominant computer firms in history. However, the company has struggled to make an impact in the social and digital entertainment space, losing pace to both old rivals like Apple[30] and upstarts like YouTube, Hulu, Instagram and Twitter. Microsoft has made inroads in recent years, first acquiring Minecraft (with its 100 million-plus MAUs), followed by LinkedIn.'Minecraft I think was a great acquisition for Microsoft because of Xbox,' North said. 'Now they have this, phenomenally popular game in Minecraft. it brings in generations now of streaming digital players.''It keeps coming back and it keeps holding on to older and older players,' she continued. 'My kids are in high school. They grew up with Minecraft and they're still on Minecraft some of these influencers are now in their '20s, or even '30s, they're getting married and having kids, and they're still on Minecraft.'Between Minecraft, Xbox, and LinkedIn, Microsoft appears to have the cradle-to-cubicle pipeline pretty well locked down. However, '[TikTok's audience] is still missing, especially the young adult crowd,' North argued. 'They're completely not part of Microsoft's digital demographic and nobody's really identified the company as a leader. So if Microsoft brings in TikTok, then they actually become a company to watch.'TikTok's new CEO, Kevin Meyer, is also sitting in the catbird seat. The former Disney executive who helmed the development of Disney+ only to be passed over for the seat vacated by now retired-CEO Bob Iger. 'I was happy with my job at Disney,' Mayer told the NYT[31] in May. 'The magnitude of this opportunity was just something I couldn't pass up.' Especially now that he has a chance at potentially earning a C-Suite office in Redmond.Facebook is another unexpected winner from this sale. Though not party to the transaction itself, the Silicon Valley social media company did just so happen to have its TikTok clone, Reels, loaded up and ready to release[32] right as Trump's bellowing hit its climax. Weird how that worked out so conveniently[33].But you know who isn't happy about all of this? That's right, China. 'China will by no means accept the 'theft' of a Chinese technology company, and it has plenty of ways to respond if the administration carries out its planned smash and grab,' per an op-ed published on Wednesday in the state-run newspaper China Daily[34].'President Trump is turning the once great America into a rogue country,' Hu Xijin, the editor of (also) state-owned Chinese paper, the Global Times, tweeted on Monday[35]. As Guggenberger concedes, there's not a whole lot preventing China from turning the tables on the US and demanding similar sales ie, demanding that Microsoft sell its China-based business ventures to a Chinese firm if it, as a whole, wants to keep operating in the country.So while there are clearly winners and at least one loser in this national fire sale, the future effects and implications for American civil rights, not to mention the nation's relationship with near-peer China, won't likely be resolved before November's elections. Unfortunately, neither will Tim Wu's insightful question, posited on Monday[36], 'which is more anticompetitive: letting TikTok to be banned altogether in the US, or letting it be absorbed into one of the 5 giant tech conglomerates we call big tech?'

He has lied about the wall. There's no wall. Just a few sections of mended fence. And he has lied about standing by his most ferocious supporters. We've been exterminated and he has no sincere plans to do anything about it,\" Mr. Yiannopoulos told The Times.</p><p> \"Trump has sat back and watched his 2016 support base get hunted down and immolated by Big Tech's Orwellian 'Trust and Safety' teams. All his most popular, effective, idiosyncratic and fascinating cheerleaders have been wiped out, replaced by opportunistic, uninspiring, money-hungry Trump-hating careerists,\" added Mr. Yiannopoulos, a former member of Breitbart News who was banned from Twitter and Facebook in 2016 and 2019, respectively.</p><p> Mr. Trump took aim at Twitter from his personal account on the platform late Tuesday after the company began to add fact-checking warning labels to his posts about alleged voter fraud.</p><p> \"Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!\" Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday evening.</p><p> \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,\" Mr. Trump added Wednesday.\"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\"</p><p> Mr. Trump singled out Twitter on the platform again Wednesday, tweeting: \"Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct. Big action to follow!\"</p><p>Twitter declined to comment on Mr. Trump's tweets.</p><p> Stone, 67, was punted from Twitter for violating its policies against harassment after his account mounted a hateful tirade against CNN anchor Don Lemon. Mr. Yiannopoulos, 35, was booted for \"inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others\" following a dispute on the service with \"Ghostbusters\" actress Leslie Jones.</p><p> Both men previously said they would sue Twitter for banning them from the platform. Twitter confirmed to The Times on Wednesday that both remain suspended and cannot start new accounts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-17B3DAF2B47BEDA8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600V-CFD1-DXVP-V0K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"592\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>28 May 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump has responded to a ridiculous fact check by Twitter, ordering the FCC and FTC to 'consider' interpreting their regulations to strip social media businesses of immunity for politically biased censorship. For years now, deeply biased progressives who control the major social media platforms have manipulated their businesses to promote the progressive line and to attack / silence conservatives. Examples are legion, from Twitter banning and shadowbanning Conservatives[1],to YouTube restricting and demonetizing[2] Conservative sites, to Google practicing viewpoint discrimination[3] against Conservatives via its algorithms. </p><p>(That said, even Zuckerberg of Facebook has not been so foolish[4] as to directly and openly target POTUS.) As the Federalist opines[5] today: Everyone knows that Silicon Valley is politically progressive and, asVox reported Wednesday[6], its top executives are working hard to elect presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Conservatives have wailed against these practices for years. Various people have brought lawsuits, such as that brought by Praeger U against Google and Youtube[7], challenging Google's decision to restrict access to and demonitize Praeger U videos. A California lower court judge ruled last year that Google was a private business and not subject to First Amendment limitations[8], a ruling the 9th Circuit recently upheld[9]. This blatant discrimination finally came to a head recently when Twitter decided to append a bullshit 'fact check' to President Trump's tweets about the risks of mail-in ballot fraud.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.bookwormroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Twitter-Fact-Check.png\">https://i1.wp.com/www.bookwormroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Twitter-Fact-Check.png</url> If you follow the 'facts about mail-in ballots' linked by Twitter, it takes you a separate page run by Twitter itself[10] where they pontificate on the absence of any factual basis for the President's tweet. On Tuesday, President Trump made a series of claims about potential voter fraud after California Governor Gavin Newsom announced an effort to expand mail-in voting in California during the COVID-19 pandemic. These claims are unsubstantiated, according to CNN, Washington Post and others. Experts say mail-in ballots are very rarely linked to voter fraud. . . .What you need to know- Trump claimed that mail-in ballots would lead to 'a Rigged Election.' However, fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud. - Trump falsely claimed that California will send mail-in ballots to 'anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there.' In fact, only registered voters will receive ballots. - Five states already vote entirely by mail and all states offer some form of mail-in absentee voting, according to NBC News.There is much more there, all of it from progressive anti-Trump media and organizations, all claiming that there is no voter fraud associated with voting by mail and that Trump is lying. Suffice it to say, that would be a surprise to Jimmy Carter, who chaired a Commission on Election Reform. In 2005, the commission reported[11]:'[Vote by mail] . . . increases the risk for fraud. . . . Vote by mail is likely to increase and of contested elections . . .The case of King County, Washington is instructive. In the 2004 gubenatorial elections, when two in three ballots there were cast by mail, authorities lacked an effective system to track the number of ballots sent or returned. As a result, King County election officials were unable to account for all absentee ballots. Moreover, a number of provisional ballots were accepted without signature verification. . . . [T]hese became issues in the protracted litigation that followed . . .. . . While there is little evidence of fraud in Oregon, where the entire state votes by mail, absentee balloting in other states has been one of the major sources of fraud. . . . The best summation of voter fraud associated with voting by mail as well as ballot harvesting is made by Tucker Carlson in the video below. Suffice it to say, Twitter's fact-free 'fact check' is nothing more than cover for the progressive goal of election theft. That is every bit as much a scandal as the attempted coup that the progressives have tried and failed to execute over the past three years. Play Video[12]None of the things that Carlson mentions appears on the pages of Twitter. And indeed, it would appear to anyone who only follows Twitter that Twitter is being an honest arbiter, along with Wapo and CNN, and has caught the President in an egregious lie when the opposite is true. Moreover, some of our states and localities, given the state of their voter rolls, would be prime for vote fraud if ballots are sent to all registered voters. For instance,[13] Absentee ballot fraud is just one method of exploiting flaws in the system to perpetrate voting fraud.In some cases, for instance, dead voters have been found to have cast votes in numerous elections, as alocal CBS report found[14]in Colorado several years ago. The same phenomenon was discoveredin Chicago[15]as well. The potential for posthumous voter fraud may be more acute in some states than others. The Public Interest Legal Foundation, a votingwatchdog group, sent anotification letter[16]to New Jersey's Division of Elections this week informing the state that it had found a total of nearly 12,000 'deceased individualswith an active registration in the State of New Jersey.' Roughly half of those, the foundation said, had died eight or more years ago. Media reports have revealed that numerous deceased residents of New Jerseyhave in the pastreceived vote-by-mail notices[17]. The Public Interest Legal Foundation also told New Jerseyit found '830potentially duplicated registrations across state lines with apparent voting credits assigned by election officials in each state for the 2018 General Election.' The foundation recently sent similar letters toVirginia[18]andNew Mexico.[19] As the old joke goes, my grandfather never voted Democrat in his entire life \u2014 not until after he died. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, defended the decision to add the 'fact check' to the President's tweet, ridiculously taking the moral high ground without acknowledging the mountain of evidence supporting President Trump's contentions. As the Federalist opines: What changed this week is that Twitter essentially came out and admitted these biases, discarding the faade of a neutral platform. The company itself, it turns out, has a point of view\u2014in this case, about absentee voting\u2014and it is willing to push that point of view on its users, not just by employing people like Roth to write and enforce its rules, but by explicitly fact-checking the President of the United States. By doing this, Twitter hasn't just waded into politics in an overt way, it has exposed the fiction at the heart of what social media companies are: they're not neutral platforms, they're biased, and like their peer organizations in the mainstream media, they're overwhelmingly biased against conservatives and in favor of progressives. Not surprisingly, President Trump has responded to this outrageous provocation, coming as it does on the heels of years of anti-conservative bias by the social media platforms. Andrea Widburg has an interesting theory at American Thinker[20]that Trump was baiting Twitter into this type of overt action, though she thought that his tweets regarding Joe Scarborough were the bait. Regardless, going into the 2020 election, it gives Trump a tremendously popular issue with his base and puts the social media platforms on thin ice indeed[21]. This from Ms. Widburg: By challenging the president that way, Twitter made the fatal mistake of overtly inserting itself as a content editor, and therefore publisher, of overtly political material. Trump was ready: Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct. Big action to follow! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2020[22] Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2020[23]The big actionappears to be that Trump willsign an executive order[24]. The best guess is that it will target the social media giants' currentimmunity from libel and defamation suits because they're viewed as bulletin boards, not publishers. However, when they actively manipulate content \u2014 especially the most political content of all, which is statements from the President of the United States \u2014 they've put themselves in an editorial position and should be held liable. This has to have been Trump's goal all along with those Scarborough tweets. He goaded Twitter into censoring him, and the social media giant walked right into his trap. Well played, President Trump. Well played. This threat, to essentially treat social media platforms as public utilities, has many on both sides of the issue up in arms. The progressive criticism is to be expected, their only concern being beating the bad orange man in the 2020 election. They will do so by any means, whether by hook or crook. Thus they cloak their embrace of the social media bias with such bullshit as Dick Blumenthal tweeting[25] that the President is actually attacking 'freedom of speech.' As Victor Davis Hanson so perceptively opined the other day, in articulating his Rule of Opposites[26]: As a general rule, when the New York Times, the Washington Post, National Public Radio, Public Broadcasting Service, NBC, CBS, ABC, MSNBC, and CNN begin to parrot a narrative, the truth often is found in simply believing just the opposite. Put another way, the media's 'truth' is a good guide to what is abjectly false. Perhaps we can call the lesson of this valuable service, the media's inadvertent ability to convey truth by disguising it with transparent bias and falsehood, the 'Doctrine of Media Untruth.' My corollary to that is that the rule applies with equal force to anything uttered by a progressive congresscritter. Regardless, as to those on the right opposed to any presidential action, their opposition is mostly grounded[27] with one foot on the First Amendment, the second foot on a knee-jerk reaction to any government regulation of private business. Law Professor Jonathan Turley, a very principled man,writes[28]: I have acolumn criticizing Twitter[29]for its labelling of tweets from President Donald Trump as presumptively false. Twitter hasyielded to demands in Congress to censor and regulate political speech[30]. In signature style, however, Trump promptly bulldozed the high ground in the controversy by threatening to close down social media companies through retaliatory regulations. The First Amendment was written to bar that very authority in either the President or Congress or both. . . . Here is the problem with the First Amendment argument. It is axiomatic to say that our Founders firmly believed that our system of government would only work as it should if people paid attention and were consuming accurate information. Utterly critical to this belief was that the people and press had to have freedom of speech in order to be able to evaluate arguments. The danger to our nation lay in the absence of free speech. As Ben Franklin said, 'Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.' As I have long pointed out, our Founders lived in an era where the only threat to Freedom of Speech lay in a government misusing its police power to censor speech. That was true throughout our nation's history until five years ago, when Google and the social media megaliths, Facebook, Youtube and Twitter, began misusing their domination of speech for partisan purporses. President Trump, in his Executive Order issued today[31], begins with noting this reality: Free speech is the bedrock of American democracy. Our Founding Fathers protected this sacred right with the First Amendment to the Constitution. The freedom to express and debate ideas is the foundation for all of our rights as a free people. In a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators. The growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology. Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share their views on current events through social media and other online platforms. As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public square. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see. That is an excellent summation of the issue and the danger these politically biased social media platforms pose to our system of government. Unfortunately, absent legislation from Congress, the President is limited in what he can do. He cannot by fiat order that Google, Facebook, Youtube and Twitter apply the First Amendment standards or be held liable in private actions. Instead, he has publicly directed the FCC to review its interpretation of 'section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act' that provides immunity to internet providers and social media entities.' Section 230(c) was designed to address early court decisions holding that, if an online platform restricted access to some content posted by others, it would thereby become a 'publisher' of all the content posted on its site for purposes of torts such as defamation. As the title of section 230(c) makes clear, the provision provides limited liability 'protection' to a provider of an interactive computer service (such as an online platform) that engages in '#8216;Good Samaritan' blocking' of harmful content. Ultimately, Trump is asking the FCC to interpret its regulation such that a social media entity engaged in politically biased censorship or other like decisions lose its immunity. Likewise, Trump enlists the Federal Trade Commission: It is the policy of the United States that large online platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, as the critical means of promoting the free flow of speech and ideas today, should not restrict protected speech. The Supreme Court has noted that social media sites, as the modern public square, 'can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard.' Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017). Communication through these channels has become important for meaningful participation in American democracy, including to petition elected leaders. These sites are providing an important forum to the public for others to engage in free expression and debate. Cf.PruneYard  Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 85-89 (1980). In May of 2019, the White House launched a Tech Bias Reporting tool to allow Americans to report incidents of online censorship. In just weeks, the White House received over 16,000 complaints of online platforms censoring or otherwise taking action against users based on their political viewpoints. The White House will submit such complaints received to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC shall consider taking action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, pursuant to section 45 of title 15, United States Code. Such unfair or deceptive acts or practice may include practices by entities covered by section 230 that restrict speech in ways that do not align with those entities' public representations about those practices. There is more, but this is the meat of the Order. As Turley notes, this is an end-run around Congress. That said, having watched Obama do that for eight years to the applause of the left, I am willing to be labeled a hypocrite in this instance for supporting Trump for doing the same. Actually, this one is long overdue. For his part, six months ago, Slow Joe Biden agreed with Trump's criticism of Section 230. Apparently, that changed when Trump articulated his EO. Wonder if anyone in the MSM will notice (h/t Instapundit[32])?Unreal. It's like the Biden campaign doesn't even track what their candidate says. Here's Biden in December, telling the New York Times editorial board that 'Section 230 should be revoked immediately' for tech companies 'It should be revoked.

I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>Today, the Trump administration is filing regulation that would make it much harder for migrants crossing the southern border to claim asylum. It comes just after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement began raids targeting some 2,000 undocumented my migrants.</p><p>It's a move the president had been telegraphing loudly only to be dramatically overshadowed on Sunday when he himself used what many believed to be some of his most racist rhetoric yet, tweeting that that four Democratic congresswomen of color should go back to the places they came from.</p><p>Leaders abroad and at home have condemned the message. Here in the U.K., the British prime minister, Theresa May called the comments completely unacceptable. House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said, \"Make America great again has always been about making America White again.\"</p><p>The four in question are Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. The only one not born in the United States was Omar who moved there when she was a 12-year-old Somali refugee.</p><p>I spoke about all of this with the Republican Congressman, Will Hurd. His Texas district abuts much of the southern border with Mexico, so immigration policy also literally hits home.</p><p>Congressman Hurd, welcome back to the program.</p><p>REP. WILL HURD (R-TX): It's my pleasure. It's always awesome to be on chatting with you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, thanks, Congressman. And I obviously want to start with the controversial nature of President Trump's tweet. I mean, you know, people are calling it racist, a firestorm, you know, lighting a fuse. It's really hit a nerve even over this side of the Atlantic.</p><p>So, just to remember what he said, he said, \"They originally come from countries who governments are a complete and total catastrophe. They should go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they come.\" That is aimed at four freshman Congress people.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi has called it xenophobic. How do you describe that? Do you call it xenophobic? Do you believe its racist?</p><p>HURD: I think those tweets are racist and xenophobic. They are also inaccurate, right. The four women he is referring to are actually citizens of the United States, three of the four were born here. It's also a behavior that's unbecoming of the leader of the free world. He should be talking about things that unite us, not divides us. And also, I think, politically, it doesn't help.</p><p>While you had a civil war going on within the Democratic Party, between the far-left and the rest of the party, now they have circled the wagons and are starting to protect one another. We can disagree without being disagreeable. I don't agree with many of the things they are talking about and that - or (ph) proposals that they are putting forward, but that's where the debate should be on, not these other issues.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Can I just ask you why you think the president keeps doing this kind of stuff, making controversial comments on Twitter and stoking certain flames? I mean, do you think the president is racist?</p><p>HURD: Well, you'd have to ask him those questions, but the comments were indeed racist. Look, I'm the only black in the Republican in the House of Representatives. I go into communities that most Republicans don't show up in order to take a conservative message. And when you have this being the debate, that activity becomes even harder.</p><p>And the only way we're going to -- you know, I'm from Texas. And I always say, \"If the Republican Party in Texas doesn't start looking like Texas, there won't be a Republican Party in Texas.\" And I think that goes for the rest of the country. So, this makes it harder in order to take our ideas and our platform to communities that don't necessarily identify with the Republican Party.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So now, let's talk about the other big issue and that is asylum and immigration and [13:05:00] detention and zero-tolerance policy and all of that.</p><p>So, what about now, the administration has petitioned to make formal what has been talking about a long time and that is almost no asylum in the United States except via a third country?</p><p>HURD: Sure. That proposal was announced this morning. I do believe that our asylum laws should be tweaked. I think this move is probably going to get challenged in the courts. This is something that I've said, if we are going to tweak our asylum laws -- or my (ph) asylum laws, it needs to be done in Congress.</p><p>And we need -- and unfortunately, there are people that are taking advantage of our asylum laws. One of the other things that should stop happening is we should stop treating everybody that's coming into this country illegally as if they are an asylum seeker. Not everybody is actually asking for asylum.</p><p>And when the asylum laws are being abused, this hurts the people that actually need asylum laws. And when you look at our immigration courts, somewhere around 18 percent of people are the ones that, ultimately, when they go through the immigration system, the immigration court system, ultimately, gets - get granted asylum.</p><p>And so, those are the folks that are being impacted. I do believe it's time for the House and the Senate in a bipartisan way to try to address some of these issues. I have some proposals out there. But, again, I think this recent move is likely to get challenged in courts.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, from what I hear you saying, you don't support this new regulation?</p><p>HURD: Asylum laws is just one piece of the problem. The real long-term issue here is violence, lack of economic opportunity and extreme poverty in the Northern Triangle, that's El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.</p><p>We should have a special representative for the Northern Triangle, that's a senior diplomat appointed by the secretary of state who should be working on the coordinating the strategy across the U.S. government with those three countries, but also work with the organization of American states, work with the International Development Bank.</p><p>This crisis is not just problem in the U.S. and Mexico, it's a problem for the entire U.S. Western Hemisphere. And we need to get the entire Western Hemisphere involved. And I think that starts by creating, in essence, a Marshall plan for that region to address those root causes. That's where we should be putting time and effort in.</p><p>And the other piece is human smuggling. If you're coming through our southern border legally, you've likely paid $7,000 to a human smuggler. And we are collecting information on phone numbers and data on those human smugglers, but the U.S. Intelligence Community is not doing enough in order to counter that.</p><p>We should be dismantling the infrastructure that these human strugglers have put in. And guess what, they are making more money because they are bringing more people in. And so, we need to be addressing that and working with our allies and all of those countries to do that. And I have a bipartisan piece of legislation that we're actually introducing today with Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat from Virginia, to say we should be prioritizing and making -- countering human smuggling and human trafficking a national intelligence priority.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Congressman, what about the ICE raids? I mean, I can see you pushing back on quite a few of these controversial issues that are coming out of the administration. You know, this huge sort of drum roll to what we were going to -- told were going to be mass deportations, some people might have thought that was tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, but maybe only, and I put that in inverted comments, 2,000. But it doesn't seem that that's happening.</p><p>First and foremost, do you support the notion of ICE doing mass deportations?</p><p>HURD: So, there are about 900,000 people in the United States who have gone through their entire immigration hearing and have been ordered to be removed from the country by a judge. So, ultimately, the United States, we should be enforcing our laws. But because we are dealing with this crisis right now at the border, we should be having all of our resources on the border to deal with the current crisis.</p><p>We don't have enough folks in ICE, we don't have enough folks in border patrol, we don't have enough folks in HHS. And so, we should be prioritizing our resources to address this current problem.</p><p>And I actually believe we should be getting to a point where, you know, last in, first out. The people that are more recently trying to come into the country illegal and should be deported, we should focus on them first. This is going to have more of an impact in those countries where they are ultimately coming from. And we also need more immigration judges.</p><p>I've tried to increase -- you know, there is also a 900,000-person backlog in our immigration courts. You know, and the average [13:10:00] time it takes to get through these courts is over 600 days. I tried to increase the number of immigration judges in a recent appropriations bill and how we fund the government, and my friends on the other side of the aisle voted it down. We need more resources in order to deal with the problem that we are seeing on our southern border.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Congressman, a lot of the issues and a lot of the questions I've raised I see you pushing back against what might be called current Trump Republican orthodoxy. And you do seem to be out of step with that sort of certain strain of the Republican Party.</p><p>I just want to ask you, you know, a couple of questions on this. You know, there's a recent Texas monthly profile on you that said many conservatives have come to see you as guardian of the soul of the old party. You're the old soul of the party. Joe Straus, Republican, former speaker of Texas House said, \"I think he is exhibit A in Texas for what the future of the Republican Party needs to be.\"</p><p>Do you see yourself that way? And what do you think these old-timers mean by that? What are they yearning for?</p><p>HURD: Well, what I like to say, I'm the face of the future Republican Party, you know. And the future Republican Party, we are going to solve problems the way we have often solved them in the past. We should be empowering people, not empowering governments.</p><p>When you look at independents and conservative Democrats in the United States, they are concerned where the direction of the Democratic Party is going. And our opportunity is to appeal to those folks. In 2020, about a third of the electorate is going to be under the age of 29.</p><p>When you go back to Ronald Reagan, he won the under 29 vote by like 30 points. I think we can compete in these areas. That's what I've demonstrated in a truly 50/50 district. My district, Hillary Clinton won by four points in 2016. And in the most recent election, Beto O'Rourke beat Senator Ted Cruz by five points, yet I continue to survive and win partly because, you know, I try to have a message that is reflective of where the majority of the country is.</p><p>Crisscrossing a district like mine, I've learned way more what unites us and divides us. And so, I try to talk about those this. And ultimately, Christiane, I -- you know, spent nine-and-a-half years as undercover officer in the CIA. I'm a professional intelligence officer. You know, my entire adult life has been about collecting information and articulating that.</p><p>So, you know, I'm going to use those skills and those things I've learned and try to solve problems, not resort to the political rhetoric. And so, that's how I've been able to perform and be successful.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, I mean, you have just laid out exactly the case that some people are making for you, particularly your background based in facts and evidence and intelligence, and then deciding on solutions and actions rather than just rhetoric.</p><p>But, again, I want to ask you because you do stand out. You are a Republican. And I guess I want to ask you, first, are you, yourself, surprised at what some people might say is a bit of a moral failure or a little craven of so many Republicans who simply have not stood up and said anything about President Trump's, what you've just called, racist tweets?</p><p>HURD: Well, it's concerning to me that there are people that think that is OK, that kind of behavior is OK. I've learned that -- you know, my dad always taught me when I was young, the one person you can't fool is the person you're looking at in the mirror in the morning. So, be honest, treat people with respect and say what you mean. And that's how I've always pursued things (ph) and then also trying to articulate alternatives.</p><p>So, you know, my goal is to be an example and, you know, ultimately, I think that is what I'm trying to do, but you're going to have to ask some of those other folks. But it is something that we should look at is, why in 2019 do we think it's OK to say some of these things? You know, this is -- one of the things I've learned going to church on Sundays and, you know, I don't care which faith you believe in, there's some, you know, story to this point. And when Jesus was asked what is the most important commandment, he said to love thy Lord God with all of your heart, mind and soul. But he said equally as important is to love your neighbor like yourself. And I think we need to remember more of that, and I think we would be better off.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let us gets back to this truly appalling situation at the border. We have had, you know, people from within the system are reacting against some of the more draconian measures undertaken by this White House, whether it's zero-tolerance, whether it's -- also some issues by the census and all of the rest of it. [13:15:00] And now, of course, it's about the children who have been put into, you know, unconscionable conditions in the United States of America, including your state, this was in Clint, of course.</p><p>And we have had Vice President Pence visiting recently and seeing some of these literal cages which are overstuffed with people. There's a little bit of the pool report says the stench was horrendous, the cages were so crowded that it would have been impossible for all of the men to lie on the concrete. When the men saw the press arrive, they began shouting, wanted to tell us they've been there 40 days or longer. The men said they were hungry, wanted to brush their teeth. It was sweltering hot. Agents were guarding cages wearing face masks.</p><p>You know, Mike Pence said he wasn't surprised and shows that the system is overwhelmed. I mean, you know, yes, it is. But isn't that, you know, cruel and unusual punishment for these people?</p><p>HURD: Well, first and foremost, let's talk about Clint. Clint is in my district. This is a facility that I've been into. And Border Patrol has been saying this has been a problem since back in 2014, this real issue of the unaccompanied children. These are children coming to the United States without a family member. This has been a problem since 2014. And so, border patrol has been saying that.</p><p>You've had the Department of Homeland Security inspector general issue a report back in May talking about current facilities and then you had them issue a follow-on report on July 3rd. And so, these facilities were not designed for how they are being used. Clint, specifically, was designed to temporarily house 107 people. At its height, it had 700 children under the age of 18 in that facility. They can't handle that.</p><p>ICE needs more resources. HHS -- Health and Human Services is the federal government entity that's responsible for caring for children, they need more resources. So -- and many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to vote against giving resources to these entities, they want to vote against increasing immigration judges, and then they show up to a facility that they are all saying is not designed for this and want to be outraged. That is the problem. We got to solve this issue.</p><p>HHS has new facilities that are taking care of unaccompanied children. And right now, they are getting from when they receive them to when they get placed, it's about 45 days. That is a decrease from, I think, it was 90, a number of months ago. These are facilities that just came online. There is one in my district that has about 200 children in it.</p><p>I've sent my staff down there to inspect it once it became online to make sure that the kids are being cared and fed properly. But this is a symptom of a much larger problem. And that larger problem, we already talked about is the root causes in those countries, asylum laws being abused and human smugglers increasing their activity. Those are the things that we should be addressing rather than having -- using images as political bludgeons against one another.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. But this isn't just an image -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>This is an actual fact and reality. You are based in fact --</p><p>HURD: Yes, I've been. Yes, yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But I mean, the children there. Let's just talk about the children, Congressman. It was a lawyer, a whistle-blower. She decided to go to the public because it was untenable. I just want to know whether you think that that is cruel for those children and that this administration has exacerbated this situation?</p><p>It's all very well saying that the centers aren't designed to house this number of people. But, you know, this is what happens when you separate children from their parents and don't let them go to their carers who are already in the United States.</p><p>HURD: Right. So, I've been clear. Family separation, we are conflating several issues. Family separation, I've been very clear, you should never rip children out of their family members' arms. That was a terrible policy. It was a policy that many people stood up and was against. But you have unaccompanied children problem which is different. These are kids that are coming here and they are not with a family member and trying to get them placed with someone who is actually a family member and going to not take advantage of them if they get placed. That is the current situation in a place like Clint.</p><p>And yes, nobody should be in these facilities for any length of time, let alone children, and these are things that shouldn't be happening. And we should -- and the only way you're going to solve this problem is we have to make sure that the folks within the federal government have the resources to deal with the current problem and that we are addressing the root causes and not exacerbating it.</p><p>Don't treat everybody as if they are an asylum seeker. That's increasing the amount of people that are having to be in our custody. Deal with these root causes. This is how we're going to get through the current problem.</p><p>We are seeing a dip in people coming here illegally. It may just because usually in the summer [13:20:00] you see a dip. We are seeing our allies in Mexico having to deal with this issue as well. They are taking separate steps. How long that can continue? These are the questions. And then also we need the rest of the Western Hemisphere to get involved in trying to deal with this problem.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And a huge problem, it is. Congressman Will Hurd, thank you very much for joining me.</p><p>HURD: Always a pleasure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, from that really appalling situation with children at the southern border, we now turn to a story about children that's been buried by the relentless place of U.S. political stories. Five years ago, not many people would have known what or where Chibok was, a small town in Northeastern Nigeria. It was catapulted to global infamy in 2014 by a disaster and a hash tag. Here is reminder of what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Covered from head to toe, dozens of mostly Christian girls were forced to chant from the Quran. This was the first glimpse of kidnapped Chibok school girls, after 276 were snatched from their school dormitory by Nigeria's Islamist group Boko Haram. That loosely translates as Western education is forbidden.</p><p>Fifty-seven of the girls managed to escape in the hours that followed. The rest remained captives of the gunmen. Under the hash tag \"Bring back our girls,\" their plight spread like wildfire on social media, from Malala Yousafzai to then First Lady Michelle Obama who said she saw her own daughters in these girls.</p><p>Two years later, a rare glimmer of hope for some of the families as CNN obtained an exclusive proof of life video showing 15 of the girls, it took two years to get just 21 of them released after negotiations between the government and Boko Haram.</p><p>Isha Sesay was there for CNN when they reunited with their families in Chibok. But for so many parents, there was still only heartbreak.</p><p>ISHA SESAY, FORMER CNN CORRESPONDENT: The piercing screams of mothers realizing that indeed they are not to be reunited with their daughters on this day, which has turned what should have been an overwhelmingly happy moment into a bittersweet one.</p><p>AMANPOUR: More than five years on, 107 girls have made it out of captivity. 112 are still missing. And as the campaign to free them fades with time, endless grief for so many of the families.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, Journalist Isha Sesay who you saw in that report has just written broken a book on the Chibok girls, it's called \"Beneath the Tamarind Tree,\" and it follows her time covering the story as it hit global headlines and its unprecedented access she's has to some of the kidnapped girls. And Isha is joining me now from New York.</p><p>Welcome to the program.</p><p>SESAY: Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, Isha, just from -- pick up where we left you in that little report there, you know, time is moving on. Lots of parents have been deeply disappointed, still in grief and suffering. Do you see any possibility that this is going to be resolved or are we really, you know, hostage to time erasing the urgency?</p><p>SESAY: I think to some degree we are hostage to time erasing the urgency and the Nigerian government that is beset with a multitude of problems, not only battling Boko Haram, which one faction is now aligned with ISIS and continuing to terrorize Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon. But also, that the other issues such as kidnappings that have basically proliferated across the northwest of the country, issues to do with the cattle herders and farmers in the middle belt and the Niger Delta.</p><p>So, the Nigerian government has a number of issues on its plate. But there's also just an issue of political will here, Christiane, in the sense that, as you well know from covering this at the time, that these girls come from poor families, from the north, out of the way, uneducated and they just aren't seen as a priority to this government.</p><p>And as far as they are concerned, they have done what they can to bring 103 of the girls back. The four others escaped. And for the rest, I think there's this kind of shrugging of shoulders, Christiane, to be perfectly honest.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let me ask you then about the girls, because the book -- well, I'm going to ask you why you called it \"Beneath the Tamarind Three.\" But the girls, it was very rare to see girls abducted by these Islamist groups and it's -- I find it very interesting that you called this, having talked to a lot of them, a crime of opportunity.</p><p>SESAY: Absolutely. I think that is one of the biggest misunderstandings about what happened. Because from the research I have done and speaking to the girls, when the men arrived [13:25:00] in the school that night, they set upon the goals with a host of questions. You know, they asked about brick making machine, they asked about fuel, they asked about food and where that was kept.</p><p>And when it came to actually move them -- when they said actually leave the school compound and let's step out because they were burning the buildings, there was a conversation that a number of the girls told me about and the conversation was essentially, \"Should we take them or should we put them in the burning rooms and kill them?\" So, there was an actual debate. So, they didn't come with the preorganized plan, if you will, to take them. And that is something I never knew until I did the research for this book.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. And I had not known that either. And I find that really, really interesting. And just to go back to the slogan, Boko Haram, you know, Western education is prohibit, is forbidden, is unclean, that's their basic concept. I mean, it sorts of circles back to your connection and your interest in this because, you know, you spent a lot of your youth in Freetown, Sierra Leone, your mother is from there. And education was a massively important vehicle for her and for you not to, you know, end up poor and potentially subject to this kind of captivity.</p><p>SESAY: Absolutely. You know, and I say to people who continue to ask the question, why is this story so important to you? Why does it seem so personal to you? Because I say but for lottery of life but for the fact that I was born to educated parents. My mother was born to poor Muslim parents. My grandfather was a religious man, he had multiple wives and he was uneducated. My grandmother was uneducated. She sold goods in the local market in their town, which was very similar to Chibok, poor, no plumbing, no power in most of the houses.</p><p>But my mother, despite not having, you know, examples of educated people in her family, went on to be very educated, have a PhD in English language and linguistics and to run for vice president in Sierra Leone. Because of her accomplishments, I have the life I have. And I understand that the girls in Chibok were on the same path my mother walked, a path of becoming educated and transforming their lives, their parents and potentially their children's lives. So, this hits home for me.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And it's very clear because, as I say, you know, the strongest passages are when you talk to them and you listen to them and, of course, the parents as well and the families as well. But I just want to read a piece, a little piece of what you wrote about your mom and circle it back to these girls. \"Everything in Sierra Leone's patriarchal society directs women and girls to be quiet, docile and subservient to men. But with Kadi as my bulwark, those norms never infiltrated my childhood.\"</p><p>So, Kadi is your mother. And I wonder whether when you were talking to these girls, did you get a sense that patriarchal direction subservient affected them when they were kidnapped or did they have more of a fighting spirit? Did they resist? What did they think when these guys kidnapped them?</p><p>SESAY: You know, it's really interesting because on the one hand, yes, they are children from the northeast. So, they are a product of that patriarchal conservative society. So, even when you meet them now, if there is an elder male in the vicinity or speaking to them, as soon as they meet, they kind of curtsy, they dip their heads as a sign of respect. They do keep their eyes, you know, down to the ground. They do still some of those traits.</p><p>But for all of that, when he this were in captivity, Christiane, what is remarkable were the acts of defiance and the way they pushed back in the moments that they found this untapped bravery, if you will, to say, \"When can we go home? You said we would be able to go home and you're holding us. Why are you holding us?\" Refusing to bathe became a kind of personal act of disobedience. Keeping journals, some of them were able to do that. Some snuck away with bibles and continue to practice their Christian faith even though their warned if they were caught that could lead to horrible consequences.</p><p>It is remarkable that in the midst of that culture of subservient they still held on to their strength, they still held on to each other and, you know, they didn't just capitulate, and that, again, truly surprise me and hasn't been told as part of their narrative.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I still find it extraordinary. I mean, obviously, we are focusing on those who are still captive. But, as you said, I think you said 103 -- how many? How many actually escaped?</p><p>SESAY: So, the Nigerian government -- so, there are 107 who are out now. The Nigerian government negotiated release for 103 of them. Four of those girls escaped on their own.</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR: That must have been really difficult. I mean what did they tell you about actually having the guts to get up and run away?</p><p>SESAY: Now, for the book, I didn't speak to girls who escaped after being in captivity. I spoke to girls who escaped in the hours after the abduction. And so for those girls, one of whom jumped off the truck as it entered the forest.</p><p>And another girl who ran away when they stopped for their first rest break. You know it was incredibly terrifying for them. And one of the things they kept saying was even though they knew there was a chance that they may die, that if they were discovered -- if the captors caught up with them they would be shot and killed; they decided that they would rather make a break for home.</p><p>Try to escape. And at least give their families a chance of finding their dead bodies than potentially being held captive and their families never finding them. And -- and again, you know I think one of the other reasons I wanted to write this book is because there is a kind of normalizing of -- of -- of tragedy and -- and pain from the African continent.</p><p>And so for the abduction of these girls, as much as people were shocked, there was also kind of well it happens in Africa. Lots of bad things happen in Africa. And I wanted people to understand the bond between these -- these young people and their parents.</p><p>I wanted them to understand the loss, the grief, and when you speak to the girls they so vividly tell you about the anguish they felt at being taken from their parents and why some of them chose to run.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Tell me about the title and the Tamarind tree in the title.</p><p>SESAY: So \"Beneath the Tamarind Tree,\" and this again is indicative of the process of getting them to open up to me. I spent many, many months -- well over a year doing research and going back and forth to Nigeria and speaking to the girls.</p><p>And it wasn't until 2018 -- having already started the research for this book basically fully and consistently at the beginning of 2017, it wasn't until 2018 that they opened up and told me about the moment they arrived the forest in Sambisa at the Boko Haram camp and they were -- they were told to get out of the vehicles and to go under a tree.</p><p>And I remember thinking what -- what do you mean go under that tree. I asked several times. And they said there was this giant gargantuan tree that was so overgrown with leaves and fruit and bowed almost.</p><p>It created something of hooped skirt because the branches hit the ground and they were told to part the branches and go under the tree. So they were basically hidden beneath this Tamarind tree.</p><p>AMANPOUR: From any surveillance or any -- any -- any military operation to try to get them.</p><p>SESAY: Exactly.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about one of the Moms, Ester (ph), you -- you focused on. Now she had a particularly tragic situation because -- and we have a video. Her girl, at least in this propaganda video said that she had converted to Islam and she wasn't coming home. What kind of torturous sort of emotions did you encounter with -- with the parents.</p><p>SESAY: Interviewing Ester (ph) and every time I speak to Ester (ph), it is -- it -- it leaves me so incredibly pained because even speaking about it now because her level of anguish and what it has done to her family is -- is just so -- so difficult to bear witness to.</p><p>Dorcus (ph), her daughter here that we see amongst these girls, she was the youngest of the girls to be taken. She was 15 about to turn 16 and she'll shortly turn 21. And you know for Ester (ph) -- and again, one of the things I do in this -- this -- this book is try and tell the stories of these girls as -- as girls as their favorite possessions and their habits and hobbies.</p><p>And Dorcus (ph) was a very prim and proper child who caused no trouble and was really jus the focal point of the family. She was going to go on and get a degree. Her mother had placed all her hopes in her child going off to university only for her to be snatched by Boko Haram.</p><p>And the family is just broken. She -- she can't sleep, she can barely eat, she's developed an ulcer, she has high blood pressure, and they're just utterly distraught. Seeing that video with her daughter saying -- again, one doesn't know whether she said it freely but it's a propaganda video regardless.</p><p>Hearing her say she doesn't want to come back that effectively she's with believers and doesn't want to come back to -- to non believers broke her heart -- you know it broke her heart.</p><p>But I messaged her a couple of days ago about the book and I said you know my hope is that this will recharge the conversation about the missing girls. And she said God will make her way one day for my child to come back.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well that's faith, isn't it. And Isha, thank you so much for reminding everybody that some many of these girls still remain in captivity. Of course we've said that it's important to remember the story is far from over.</p><p>Five years on, 112 gears are missing still. And their parents, as you just heard from Isha Sesay, suffer endless heartbreak. And now let's turn to what our next guest calls the new urban crisis.</p><p>Richard Florida is a leading urbalist. He's a professor and also an author. And he says America's biggest divide is not red versus blue but rather city versus suburbia; arguing that where we call home is one of the most crucial factors effecting where we sit in the social ecosystem.</p><p>He joined our Walter Isaacson to map out the state of urban hubs today from income inequality to big tech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>WALTER ISAACSON, CNNI HOST: You're a great urban study scholar and you helped invent the notion of the creative class and how that was going to revitalize American cities. Explain what that original notion was.</p><p>RICHARD FLORIDA, AUTHOR, \"THE RISE OF THE CREATIVE CLASS\": So here's -- here's where it comes from; I -- I was born in Newark in the late 1950s. I watched Newark decline and decay. I saw the city jobs and industry move to the suburbs.</p><p>I actually witnessed the national guards and tanks in the street. When I was a young scholar no one believed that cities could come back. So fast forward. Now it's the late 1980s and 1990s. I'm living in Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh was hit hard by deindustrialization.</p><p>What could begin to revive cities -- what I began to see was in places like New York, in San Francisco at the time, in Boston there was this group of people; scientist, technologist, start up people, artist, musicians, professor types who were coming back to cities and I couldn't explain it. That's where the idea of the creative class comes from.</p><p>And when we put the numbers to it, about the year 2000, what we found is that this group of people, which was less than 10 percent of the work force when I was a boy, grew with third of the workforce and in big cities these scientist, techies, business managers, knowledge workers, and artist were now 33, 40, 45 percent of the workforce.</p><p>So that is the creative class and it is the force, like it or not for good and bad that has revitalized many of our cities.</p><p>ISAACSON: And because they moved into the urban core more than they would go to the suburbs.</p><p>FLORIDA: Yes. And I think what happened really is that -- you know I wrote this book in 2002, so it's a quite a ways -- a time ago. And after about 2000, this urban rival just goes on steroids.</p><p>And -- and these folks begin to cluster in cities not just because they like cities, not because they just had great parks and amenities and universities and coffee shops, what the economist have found is the cities -- they're clustering in cities (inaudible) drives economic growth, creates innovation and productivity but they don't cluster in all cities.</p><p>Now they have gone into many cities but they tend to cluster in these superstar cities like New York or Los Angeles or London in the U.K. or these big tech ups like San Francisco or Seattle or Boston or maybe Washington D.C.</p><p>ISAACSON: You got some push back from people like Joel Kotkin who said OK, it's a great theory but the numbers don't show it. The data's not there, people actually are moving to suburbs, not cities. What would your answer to that be?</p><p>FLORIDA: And it's funny because Joel has become, believe it or not, a great personal friend and we have had some of the most vicious fights but I told him, I literally said Joel, I've learned about as much from you as I've learned from anyone else.</p><p>Look, the creative class can thrive in suburbs. And -- and -- and we did the data later. We started with metros, right, the suburban urban glomerations. When you look at the data there are some suburbs -- you know even in -- in the outskirts of Detroit; suburbs like Royal Oak and Birmingham that have very high clusters of the creative class.</p><p>I don't think it's an either/or, it's a both. But here's the point, it's not everywhere. It's in certain suburbs, it's in certain cities, it's in certain big cities, it's in certain small cities and it's where those places have the attributes that can engage this clustering.</p><p>ISAACSON: You began to see after \"The Rise of the Creative Class\" came out. Some of the downside of this sorting in America, so what did you do?</p><p>FLORIDA: So me and a guy named Bill Bishop actually worked together. He wrote this fantastic book called \"The Big Sort.\" So we were in .</p><p>ISAACSON: And explain what this is because it's about (inaudible) .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FLORIDA: For folks watching, is the idea that in America, this is way before Trump, that we were becoming more divided, not only red and blue, we were sorting into specific kinds of communities that engaged us economically but reflected our political and cultural biased. And that those divisions -- now we were talking about this is 2002.</p><p>We're expanding overtime and I think neither one of us -- certainly I could never have anticipated how big this would go. So what happened was -- when you mentioned, I took some great criticism, as you do.</p><p>When you write a popular book people read it and they criticize it. I learned form that but the world changed. The world that I was envisioning of a optimistic, rosy eyed revitalization, coming back to the city in an open-minded environment became very one sided.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>And parts of cities, not all cities, became, like, gentrified colonies, and our cities began to split apart. You know, this happened on steroids, beginning in 2000, accelerating after 2010.</p><p>The reason I came to this is, I was living in toronto where I still spend a good part of my time, and this crazy crack mayor, Rob Ford, got elected, and I was thinking \"In Toronto? Toronto the good? Toronto, the place that has healthcare for all, that has invested in transit, at least up to that point, that had safe streets and no gun -- very little gun crime? Why would they elect this populist This is a test 08:25:06 Real time before Trump?</p><p>Because the creative crass, my creative class, was colonizing the inner city, taking advantage of the great locations close to the university, close to downtown, making money off their housing as it went up, and working people and the people who worked in those low-end service industries were being pushed out, and our community, just like our country, just like America, was becoming more divided. That's what I began to see as contradiction of the creative class.</p><p>ISAACSON: And it led to a greater inequality of wealth that became part of the resentment, right?</p><p>FLORIDA: You know -- and we actually documented this in 2002 and 2003 for essays I wrote, for, at that time, the \"Washington Monthly.\" You see in these creative cores, in San Francisco and Austin and Seattle and Boston and New York, inequality was the greatest in the nation. But when I came to write about this sequel book, \"The New Urban Crisis,\" what I found was this contradiction -- the more diverse, the more dense, the more innovative, the more open minded, the more liberal and progressive, more votes for Obama, more votes for Clinton, whatever, the more inequality and more segregation. And that contradiction was what I wanted to focus on.</p><p>ISAACSON: Why does that happen?</p><p>FLORIDA: Because of the big sort. Because of this sorting of us by economic status, by class position, by level of education, we are becoming a very sorted country in which the advantage folks cluster. It can be urban. And there are still many, many advantaged folks in the suburbs of New York, in the suburbs of California, in the suburbs around Boston.</p><p>We can sort into urban centers and suburbs, but the places we sort into become so darn expensive. You know, look at housing prices in New York or San Francisco or Los Angeles, that less advantaged people, lower skilled people, working people are pushed out.</p><p>ISAACSON: So tell me about the book, then, that you wrote, that tried to explain that problem.</p><p>FLORIDA: Well, you know --</p><p>ISAACSON: Was that a walking back of your earlier book?</p><p>FLORIDA: I don't -- I don't think it's so much of a walking back as recognizing that things have changed, recognizing some mistakes that I made, and really trying to interpret the world as it evolved. And here's what it was; it kind of tracks the arc of my life. A kid born into the old urban crisis in Newark and New York City, you know, Ford (ph) declaring the city drop dead, you're in bankruptcy, go away and crisis failure, a crisis of complete and total urban failure.</p><p>A company is moving out; people moving out. A whole -- they called it, in urban studies, a hole in the doughnut. Then to see this revitalization come, slowly at first, and then flood gates open after 2000, but the new urban crisis isn't a crisis failure. Ironically enough, it's a crisis of urban success -- it's a crisis of urban success. The more these cities attracted talent, the more they attracted the creative class, the more they gentrified, the more uncool they became with other parts of the country and within themselves.</p><p>So -- and what I argued in the book is the new urban crisis isn't just a crisis of cities. When you see it play out on the electoral map in this divisions of this country, which you know so much about, it's kind of our crisis of our moment of Democratic capitalism. IT really is, how do we put these two parts of our economy, the creative centers and rest of the country, back together? Can we?</p><p>ISAACSON: So what should we do about gentrification?</p><p>FLORIDA: Well, I think -- you know, look, there's a couple of things that people or policymakers and academics and thinkers are talking about. First, there is no doubt we need to build more housing where we need it -- not out in the far-flung exurbs. We need to build more housing in the core and in those old suburbs, you know, which have the single family homes that can be densified. To do that, we've got to liberalize our use prescriptions (ph).</p><p>Number one, some people, so-called \"market urbanists,\" who I admire a lot, think that's sufficient. I think it's necessary, but insufficient. I think we've got to commit to building affordable housing. In New York now, we have a program, in this city, where if you're going to build a new tower -- I forget the exact fraction, but it's between 20 and 30 percent of those units you can't buy out.</p><p>In that new tower, that new luxury tower, have to be devoted to affordable housing. We have to build more transit to connect people out in the suburban areas, and especially those close in suburbs, and densify around the hubs. And I think the last thing we need to do, which few people are talking about, Walter, about a third of now of us in America have the great, good fortune to be members of the creative class.</p><p>We make a pretty good amount of money, even the artists and cultural works, never mind the scientists and techies. More than half of Americans work in low wage, crappy, precarious service jobs.</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>Condemned to a life almost of disadvantage, almost poverty. When we decided to build the middle class in this country, we made manufacturing work good work. My used to tell me, he worked in a factory. He started that job in the depression. When he came back from World War II, FDR, the new deal (ph), his job became a good, family-supporting job. He could buy a house in the suburbs.</p><p>He put my brother and I through college. Service works can't do that today. They are working at -- you know, if Karl Marx was back to life, he would say, they're working in immiserated, sustenance conditions. We need a national effort to upgrade the 50 percent of low wage service jobs and food service preparation, retail work, office work, that are the backbone of our economy, but people are sinking further and further into poverty.</p><p>ISSACSON: Do you think, in some ways, capitalism is broken when it comes to a market economy in cities like that?</p><p>FLORIDA: Well, in my field -- my field, we have a long tradition of Marxist, post-Marxist analyst, and a lot of critics come from that part. They want to envision -- and I learn from these people, particularly a guy named David Harvey (ph), who's absolutely brilliant. But there's a hope for a kind of socialist utopia that doesn't come.</p><p>So pragmatically, yes, capitalism is broken. What do I believe? I think we have to go about fixing it. How do I think we can best fix it? If we could just empower our cities to begin to address these problems, and why I think it works is because cities are in gated suburbs. No matter how gentrified New York or San Francisco become, there are still poor people. There are still ethic and racial minorities. They are still progressive political actors who act on politics.</p><p>So I do think our cities are going to be the place, they're going to laboratory of Democracy, that figure out the way to create a new social compact that can make this kind of capitalism work. I shutter to think at what the alternative might be.</p><p>ISAACSON: But if we empower cities, would that leave some people, like the people who live in suburbs or exurbs or in the countryside, leave them out?</p><p>FLORIDA: I think it might leave people in the reddest parts of the country out. But here's the way I figure it, and I've talked to the leading theorists this -- about this, both on the left and the right. Look, we don't agree on many things in this country. We don't agree on gun rights. We don't agree on women's rights. We don't agree on gay rights. I could go down the litany. And already, state preemption is taking a lot of those rights away. ISAACSON: Well, explain what that is.</p><p>FLORIDA: Well, states, you know, across this country are saying, because they're run by rural and suburban majorities, we are going to prohibit you from acting to control guns. Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, who's is a good friend of mind, has several pending civil suits and maybe a criminals case, from the Pennsylvania state government, that says he's acting too quickly on gun control. Gay rights are another one.</p><p>ISAACSON: And minimum wage.</p><p>FLORIDA: Minimum wage is another one. Although, we see more red states, interestingly enough, at least be able to raise their minimum wage somewhat. So I think this is happening. What the best theorist of the so- called \"federalism\" -- you know, the United States is a federal system where we can adjust the relationship between the federal, the state and local governments say.</p><p>Yes, Walter, that's a risk in the short run. Yes, that's Richard, that's a risk in the short run. Over time, though, these states and cities have to compete. So what's happening in Georgia now under the threat of these new women's rights bans and gay rights bans, the Hollywood companies are saying, we're going to have to pull the films that are being made in Atlanta.</p><p>We're going to have to bring them back to a city that doesn't impose that. So the theorists say, this competition for economic growth, well (ph), the same thing I see when I go to Texas. The business people are saying to the governor, stop it. We can't attract an Amazon HQ two if you keep up this kind of red state looneyness, in terms of social policy.</p><p>So the theorists believe that this competition between jurisdictions may lead to some places running to the bottom in the short-term, but over time, the competition will lead to better outcomes.</p><p>ISAACSON: When you look at the big (inaudible) that you and Bill Bishop have talked about, one of them is these cities and they become (ph) enclaves of creative people, and then the areas just around them. You can look at Austin, Texas, going 90 Democrat, and same with Houston, but there's -- right around it, go 90 percent for Trump. Are we dividing our country based on the new urban elite versus the rest of America?</p><p>FLORIDA: Yes. And these divides are fractal. A big word, big word, fractal. They occur at every scale. They occur between the costal elite places like the New York, Boston, Washington Card (ph) and the Southern and Northern California, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.</p><p>But then even within those places, those divides replicate. I mentioned Toronto earlier. Toronto's a very progressive place. It's a very blue place, but even within it, there's red and blue, liberal and conservative. And the way I like to think about it is, the knowledge economy or creative economy is very spiky. You know, Tom Friedman had a wonderful book that said the world is flat. For many things, manufacturing, simple service, the world has flattened completely.</p><p>But within that flat world that Tom explained so brilliantly, there are these spikes, and what happens is these spikes take on a different character, a different economic character, a different political character and a different cultural character. And the backlash is not so much about the economic inequity, it's about the cultural norms and values.</p><p>If you live in an urban center you tend to not want to have guns around you. You want safety. You want to be open-minded to all those people who are contributing to your economy. You want to be pro-immigration and pro- women's rights because women make up, believe it or not, more than half the creative class is made up of women.</p><p>Just like more than half economy -- population is made up of women. But the creative class has much greater numbers of women than say the working - - the physical working class. But if you live in one of the places in the outlying areas and you're a white middle aged man, you feel threatened.</p><p>You feel threatened by diversity, you feel threatened by women, you feel threatened by the fact that women and immigrants have gotten, in your view, a leg up. You feel threatened by the sexual and gender revolution and it creates that backlash.</p><p>So I think that backlash is not just between parts of the country. Yes, it's between parts of the country but it's within parts of the country as well.</p><p>ISAACSON: So in other words between counties and parishes (ph) or something where you have people who are very comfortable with diversity, very comfortable as a creative and knowledge economy and people who may feel that they're being looked down upon or -- by the elites.</p><p>FLORIDA: And so we have a divide in this country but it's not the old -- people get mistaken, it's not the old North/South divide, it's not a frost belt/sun belt, it's not an east/west, it's a new kind of divide that's very spiky -- big word -- very fractal, very concentrated but I -- but I think we're about even split.</p><p>You know there's about half of us that are populating one and that takes the creative class and some of the new immigrant groups. And about half the country that's populating another and sometimes we live quite closely.</p><p>Here's an interesting fact though. There's a brand new study out that -- that I found so amazing and -- and hardened me for a moment you know in times of others views may think are dark.</p><p>This was a group of political scientist who know a ton about the big sort that we've been talking about and who studied the sorting of Americans. And not just Americans, they've looked at the most sorted of us, highly active liberals and highly active conservatives.</p><p>On national issues, which we've talked about; gun control, social issues, women's rights, abortion; we are worlds apart. When they poll those same people on local issues; do you want your economy to grow, do you want good schools and they went down -- I'm giving you big -- almost complete consensus.</p><p>And that gave me hope that when we're closer together and focused on our local communities and get out of this chamber -- this echo chamber of national issues -- when we're focused on hometown -- you know Mike Bloomberg used to famously say you couldn't tell if a mayor is -- what was it, there's no liberal or conservative, republican, or democratic way to pave the street or to deal with .</p><p>ISAACSON: Pot holes have no party.</p><p>FLORIDA: Yes. Pot -- thank you. Pot holes have no party. And I think that really is the case. You know I -- when I meet with mayors and I work with a lot of them, it's very hard for me to tell and it's very hard for me to tell who's a republican or a democrat.</p><p>So I think that hardens me. When we look at the local issues and get out the echo chamber of national issues, these -- these -- these high potency national issues, I think we're a lot better to solve our problems.</p><p>ISAACSON: And so what policies would you do to try to knit the fabric closer together?</p><p>FLORIDA: So I don't think we can. I think we're really divided. And I think divides gotten worse over my life. You know and I'm 60 ish years old. I think we're going to have to realize that we are best served by living together as two Americas.</p><p>And the way to reduce -- I think Trump proves how problematic the imperial presidency -- we -- we knew it -- people like you and I knew it but until you had someone who really wasn't up for the job, you couldn't see it.</p><p>Now you can see how problematic that institution -- so what we do is take our federalist gift, this distribution of powers that we've dialed up. Right. Over the past 50 years since the (inaudible) we have dialed up the power of the federal government and we begin to dial it down.</p><p>No, we don't give all power back to the communities -- and I don't mean just the cities. We give power back to the suburbs and rural areas. We give them their tax power back, we give them their economic power back, we enable them to build their own and we enable them to create the kind of cultural context.</p><p>You know look, here's a statistic. About 20 so percent of us live in urban areas. I forget what it is. 60 ish, 70 percent of us live in suburban areas and the rest live in rural areas. The over whelming preponderant (ph) like where we live. We vote with our feet.</p><p>America we vote -- that's what the big sort is. We vote with our feet to be in the kind of places that reflect the cultural and social political context we want to live in. So let's not avoid that. Let's not spend every four or eight years screaming and yelling at one another.</p><p>Let's admit that we are two or more countries and let's live together peacefully. Let's create a united -- (inaudible) a united cities of America -- I'm trying -- united communities of America, united places of America it won't be perfect but it will be a lot more robust and resilient because we're much more successful when we distribute in any kind of system than when we concentrate it.</p><p>And I think if we reduce the stakage (ph) around these national issues, we've have a somewhat better chance of being able to get along.</p><p>ISAACSON: Richard Florida, thank you so very much.</p><p>FLORIDA: Thank you for having me, Walter.</p><p>ISAACSON: Appreciate it.</p><p>FLORIDA: It's great to spend time with you.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And hope does spring eternal. Thanks for watching and goodbye from London.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019071501cbk28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK3-M351-DXH2-617Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US IMMIGRATION &amp;

The company said the president had glorified violence, in violation of its policies, by decrying protesters in Minneapolis as \"THUGS\" and saying that looting would lead to \"shooting.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter hid Trump's tweet from public view, appending a label to it that also prevented it from being easily shared - a punishment the company meted out a second time hours later when the White House sent the same comment from its official account. The move left Trump and his allies seething, promising to penalize Twitter and its social media peers over unproven claims about censorship.</p><p>\"They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States,\" Trump charged in a tweet Friday morning.</p><p>The actions of Trump and his top allies in recent days have troubled free-speech advocates, current and former federal regulators and the very social media companies on which the president has come to rely. Trump had never targeted the tech industry in this way before, despite years of verbal lashings, so critics saw in Trump's behavior a new attempt to use the Oval Office as a means to exact political revenge, with potentially costly consequences.</p><p>\"It is one thing for political candidates to be making aggressive statements toward tech companies and the media,\" said Adrian Shahbaz, the director of technology and democracy at Freedom House, a human rights watchdog that tracks press freedom. \"It's another thing for people in power to be making those same threats.\"</p><p>Shahbaz fretted that Trump might be \"using whatever means possible to coerce companies and manipulate speech for electoral gain,\" adding, \"The words of the president matter.\"</p><p>The White House declined to comment. The Trump campaign pointed to previous comments accusing the industry of improperly setting itself up as the \"arbiters of truth.\"</p><p>The emerging standoff between Trump and the tech industry reflects years of tension dating to the days before he won the presidency, when many executives and engineers in the liberal-leaning San Francisco Bay area actively campaigned against him. The relationship between Silicon Valley and Washington never fully thawed, and Trump has continued to harbor an intense, public skepticism of some of the very social media sites that were widely seen as critical to his 2016 victory.</p><p>The president's attacks hinge on allegations that Twitter and other tech companies suppress conservatives, systematically limiting their reach online. Such views are shared widely among Republicans, including on Capitol Hill, even as Internet giants insist on their political neutrality.</p><p>\"The big tech billionaires are so drunk with power that they are now willing to try to censor and silence the president of the United States,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has held multiple hearings on the issue, said Friday. \"Big tech's claim there are no clear empirical data demonstrating bias is reminiscent of the child who kills his parents and then pleads mercy of the court because he's an orphan.\"</p><p>A YouGov poll in July similarly found widespread belief in claims of political bias, with nearly half of all Americans saying they were somewhat or very likely to be true. Among GOP voters, 3 in 4 said they were somewhat or very likely to be correct.</p><p>The attacks have put tech companies, including Twitter, into a political vise, trapped amid competing obligations to police a wide array of abusive content on the Internet while at the same time satisfying politicians who question their motives and decisions - all in the midst of a high-stakes election year.</p><p>\"The companies have become more willing to change the rules based on political pushback,\" said Alex Stamos, a former Facebook chief security officer and now head of the Stanford Internet Observatory, which studies disinformation. \"It's been happening for years. It's just that Trump has gone well beyond where others were willing to go.\"</p><p>Trump long has threatened to penalize Silicon Valley over allegations of bias, even at one point holding a summit at the White House to explore claims of censorship. But he formalized his threats after Twitter took the rare step to label two of Trump's tweets about the 2020 election and redirect users to fact-checking resources.</p><p>An executive order the president signed Thursday directed federal agencies to consider rethinking a critical portion of law, known as Section 230, that spares tech companies from being held liable for the content posted by their users. If federal agencies carry that out as Trump intends, probing and penalizing social media sites for their practices, the order could affect every app, website and digital service people use to congregate online.</p><p>\"A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communication in the United States,\" Trump said as he signed the directive.</p><p>The prospect for wide-ranging consequences imperiling free speech on the Web quickly united a rare crop of critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, conservative groups funded by the Koch family, Democratic lawmakers and major technology companies. It raised significant legal questions, said Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President Barack Obama.</p><p>Its issuance alone amounted to a form of \"cold coercion,\" Wheeler said. \"It is to create consequences for editorial decisions in which he doesn't agree.\"</p><p>Twitter for years had resisted such pressure to discipline the president for comments seen as toxic or false, believing users should have an unfettered view into their leaders' thoughts. On Friday, the company adopted a more aggressive approach to another Trump tweet, focused on the unrest in Minneapolis.</p><p>While Twitter decided to limit the reach of that tweet, Facebook, in contrast, did not take action against the president's remarks. The company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, posted online that he had a \"visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric\" - but he said it did not break the  site's rules. \"I know many people are upset that we've left the president's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,\" he said.</p><p>In blasting the tech companies, Trump exploited the vulnerabilities of an industry whose products and services remain widely popular. The industry's legacy of missteps - including disinformation that spread virally online during the 2016 election and major privacy mishaps - have contributed to an erosion of its overall public support.</p><p>A Pew Research Center poll in July found that the percentage of Americans who view tech as having an overall positive impact had fallen sharply since 2015, down from 71 percent to 54 percent. Among Republicans, the number fell to 44 percent.</p><p>Daniel Kriess, an associate professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, viewed Trump's actions through the prism of the 2020 presidential race. \"This is the president deliberately picking a fight with Silicon Valley tech companies because he stands to gain electorally,\" he said. \"Particularly for his base, this is a very easy foil for President Trump.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-6bd58b30-a1fc-11ea-b5c9-570a91917d8d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6017-RBC1-JBFW-C0N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1320\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 30, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, posted online that he had a \"visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric\" - but he said it did not break the  site's rules. \"I know many people are upset that we've left the president's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,\" he said.</p><p>In blasting the tech companies, Trump exploited the vulnerabilities of an industry whose products and services remain widely popular. The industry's legacy of missteps - including disinformation that spread virally online during the 2016 election and major privacy mishaps - have contributed to an erosion of its overall public support.</p><p>A Pew Research Center poll in July found that the percentage of Americans who view tech as having an overall positive impact had fallen sharply since 2015, down from 71 percent to 54 percent. Among Republicans, the number fell to 44 percent.</p><p>Daniel Kriess, an associate professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, viewed Trump's actions through the prism of the 2020 presidential race. \"This is the president deliberately picking a fight with Silicon Valley tech companies because he stands to gain electorally,\" he said. \"Particularly for his base, this is a very easy foil for President Trump.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-6bd58b30a1fc11eab5c9570a91917d8d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6017-K8D1-DYX1-H017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1320\"/><timeReceived>11:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 30, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While Mr. Trump now claims his comment about injecting disinfectants was \u201cvery satirical,\u201d there has been speculation that he was influenced by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">the leader of a group peddling such cures</url>, even as the Food and Drug Administration <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">moved to block the group</url> from distributing its product.</p><p>In the social media groups we monitor, President Trump\u2019s words were taken as a beacon of hope. As one <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">promoter wrote</url>: \u201cMr. President Donald Trump I totally agree with you. Chlorine Dioxide is a very noble product that has been used for many years throughout the world to cure people.\u201d</p><p>For the past five years, as concerned parents of autistic kids, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">we\u2019ve been documenting</url>, following and reporting the \u201cbleach cures\u201d movement. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">Genesis II Church</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">Kerri Rivera</url>, among others, have been selling products like chlorine dioxide, marketed as \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">Miracle Mineral Solution</url>,\u201d or M.M.S., stating that the substances will cure autism, acne, cancer, diabetes, Covid-19 and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">so much more</url>. This is a crucial red flag for pseudoscience: When a product claims it can cure anything, it\u2019s a fake.</p><p>It has taken a pandemic to expose this movement and the ways that pseudoscience scammers use social media and fear to sell their products. It\u2019s crucial, now more than ever, to look at the consequences of misinformation and why we need a more responsible approach to content management from big tech companies such as Facebook and our regulating authorities.</p><p>We have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">infiltrating</url> pseudoscience groups on social media in order to report these companies to regulators, with mixed results. We\u2019ve gotten a close look at the psychology that draws people toward such products \u2014 and in our view, it is akin to the psychology that drives some of the Trumpist worldview. It is a siege mentality, rooted in the ideology of the anti-vaccine movement, based on anecdotes, conspiracy theories and a fear-mongering distrust of so-called Big Government.</p><p>From monitoring these groups, we\u2019ve watched as the marketing of the \u201cbiomedical cure\u201d industry has become increasingly linked with a distrust of social institutions in general. Much of it is based around the autism-vaccine myth, first made popular by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">Andrew Wakefield</url> and later perpetuated by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">Jenny McCarthy, Robert Kennedy Jr. and others</url>.</p><p>President Trump himself has lent support to the autism-vaccine myth, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">tweeting in March 2014</url>:</p><p>The belief that there is a link between vaccines and autism <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">has been disproved</url> by many studies, but some parents still decline to vaccinate their children. As a result of lower vaccination rates, communities around the world have experienced outbreaks of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">measles</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">mumps</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">rubella</url> and other serious illnesses.</p><p>What do the \u201ccures\u201d being touted look like? Unfortunately, parents of autistic children have been advised by M.M.S. sellers to feed their children <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">a protocol of 16 doses of bleach orally,</url> in addition to a bleach enema to \u201ccure\u201d their condition. In the last five years, poison control centers have managed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">more than 16,000 chlorine dioxide cases</url>, including a 6-year-old autistic girl hospitalized with liver failure.</p><p>Thousands of parents have been swayed into the dark world of autism \u201cbiomedicine\u201d and their children have become 24-hour test subjects for dangerous protocols such as M.M.S., <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">chelation</url> and other products that have no evidence of benefit and clear evidence of harm. We think of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">the case of Abubakar Tariq Nadama</url>, who died following a \u201cchelation for autism\u201d treatment.</p><p>One reason it is so difficult to combat M.M.S. is that it\u2019s more than just a product: It\u2019s a belief system. With Genesis II, for example, bleach products are made by an organization calling itself a \u201cchurch\u201d and touting its products as \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">sacraments</url>.\u201d We have seen the sellers create online \u201cparent support communities\u201d where the ideology around the product is continually reinforced. Group administrators, who work directly for the seller, cajole parents to \u201cstay the course\u201d and keep using the product.<br/><br/>Think about the message this sends to children with autism. To know your parents want to \u201ccure\u201d your neurological differences to the extent that they would feed you bleach multiple times a day is devastating.</p><p>The lack of regulatory protection is a big part of the problem. Pseudoscience thrives when there is cultural complacency. We reach out regularly to Facebook and other platforms asking for the M.M.S. \u201csupport group\u201d pages to be shut down, but often Facebook\u2019s response is that the groups do not \u201cgo against one of our specific Community Standards.\u201d Kerri Rivera\u2019s bleach-cure Facebook groups had thousands of followers before they were shut down \u2014 only after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">pressure from the media</url>.</p><p>YouTube was also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">initially slow to respond</url> in our view; however, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">it is responding now</url>. To their credit, Amazon and eBay have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">removed M.M.S. products</url> for sale.</p><p>While Health Canada has been cracking down on M.M.S., and one seller was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">convicted under Canada\u2019s Food and Drug Act</url>, the F.D.A. has been much slower to take action. Although we\u2019ve contacted the F.D.A. for years, it wasn\u2019t until this month that it issued temporary <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">injunctions</url> against the bleach-cure sellers based on the groups\u2019 Covid-19 marketing. In our view, this should have happened long before the pandemic, to protect children with autism and others.</p><p>This week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html\">scientists, doctors and public health authorities</url> are themselves taking to social media in an attempt to reverse the harm of the bleach-cure myth.

About 4:00 a.m. here in England. And don't forget to check out my podcast, podcastone.com. Shannon Bream and the \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" team take it all from here. Ms. Shannon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: She's working 24 hours a day. Thank you for doing it, Laura, and being there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin now with a Fox News alert. Breaking news tonight from London where the president is gearing up for serious business with the outgoing prime minister. His visit has been filled with pomp and circumstance. But what about all those promised protests? Well, stick around for highlights from the president and first lady's dinner with the royal family and all of the scenes of the day.</p><p>Plus, Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no criminal activities surrounding the 2016 Trump Tower meeting. But Jared Kushner still facing tough questions about it. And as Democrats threatened to subpoena Mueller to force him to testify. Tray Gowdy joins us to talk about the top questions he has for the former special counsel.</p><p>And later, we're taking the polls of progressive lawmakers on impeachment as they return to town. Some top Democrats the House is already laying the groundwork for proceedings to begin. Stick around for that.</p><p>Hello and welcome to Fox News @ Night. I'm Shannon Bream in Washington. We begin tonight with correspondent Kristin Fisher as day two of president Trump's official state visit to the U.K. is about to begin. Kristin?</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, tomorrow, President Trump will be getting down to business. His last meeting with outgoing British prime minister, Theresa May. But today, was all about the spectacle of a state dinner with the queen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FISHER (voice-over): From a 41-gun salute welcoming President Trump and the first lady to Buckingham Palace to a string orchestra at a white tie and tiara banquet. The queen rolled out the most red of red carpets for the president's first official state visit, a trip timed to coincide with the 75th anniversary of D-Day.</p><p>TRUMP: We thank God for the brave sons of the United Kingdom and the United States who defeated the Nazis and the Nazi regime and liberated millions from tyranny.</p><p>QUEEN ELIZABETH, QUEEN OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: After the shared sacrifices of the Second World War, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions to ensure that the horrors or conflict would never be repeated.</p><p>FISHER: A subtle not to NATO and the United Nations, two institutions President Trump loves to criticize. But that was nothing compared to the scathing op-ed penned by London's mayor who said, \"Rather than bestowing Trump with a platform of acceptability to the world, we should be speaking out and saying that this behavior is unacceptable and that it poses a grave threat to the values and principles we have fought hard to defend, often together for decades.\"</p><p>Moments before touching down in England, President Trump fired back on Twitter saying, \"Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts, has done a terrible job as the mayor of London, has been foolishly nasty to the visiting president of the United States by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\"</p><p>And the focus tomorrow will be on Brexit and trade. The president has been highly critical of how Prime Minister May has handled negotiations to exit the European Union and he's already urging her successor to walk away without a deal and sign a free trade agreement with the United States.</p><p>TRUMP: I think there's an opportunity for a very big trade deal at some point in the near future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER: Now, a large protest is scheduled for tomorrow. They'll be marching from Trafalgar Square to 10 Downing Street which is where President Trump and Prime Minister May will be meeting one last time. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Kristen Fisher with all the latest in looking ahead to the next day. Thank you very much.</p><p>So as activists threaten to ramp up protests against President Trump in London, television personality, Piers Morgan says the opposition is being disrespectful and, in his words, pathetic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIERS MORGAN, TELEVISION PERSONALITY: Why is Trump so much more morally reprehensible than the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who executes journalists --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's more of a comment of Donald Trump's that he's egotistical.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: OK. Let's turn to former foreign policy advisor to President Obama's campaign, David Tafuri. And member of the U.K. parliament, Lord John Taylor of Warwick. Great to have you both with us, gentlemen.</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER: Thank you.</p><p>JOHN TAYLOR, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Ok. So this is what Reuters says about what's coming tomorrow. They say a giant inflatable blimp depicting Donald Trump as a pouting baby in a diaper will fly outside the British parliament in London on Tuesday ahead of what's expected to be one of the city's largest protests against a foreign leader.</p><p>Lord Taylor, what do you make of the situation there in the U.K.?</p><p>TAYLOR: Well, I think that protest is childish. Donald Trump is the democratically elected president of the United States of America. America is our strongest ally. We go back a long way. We have a special relationship. We should respect the office. You know, respect the post. His position. Forget the man. He is president. He is owed respect for his position.</p><p>BREAM: All right. David, you know that, of course, this is about to be in large part the anniversary of D-Day and how the U.S. and Britain and allies joined together to overcome potential world devastation. And they accomplished a lot in working together.</p><p>So why is it that when an American leader goes to Great Britain and it's not just President Trump, but there are, you know, talk of these huge protests when there are other leaders of other -- you know, some would argue more controversial nations like China and Russia. We don't see the same kind of outpouring in the streets.</p><p>TAFURI: Well, it's a good point. Look, this visit is much bigger than any presidents, bigger than President Trump, it's bigger than any of our previous presidents. It's about commemorating the brave soldiers from the U.K. and from the U.S. who fought together against Nazi extremism, the 75th anniversary of D-Day. So we should all keep that in mind.</p><p>And President Trump brought a little bit of this on himself by getting in these feuds before he came to London, by getting into feud with the mayor of London, by making some comments about Meghan Markle. I hope he can now put that aside and really focus on D-Day.</p><p>It's unfortunate that there will be protests with our president going there. No American likes to see that. I don't like to see that. I do think that we need to respect the office of the president. But, of course, the U.K. people have a right to protest against any visitor. You would hope they would protest if Vladimir Putin visited or China -- the head of China visited. There's a lot more to protest for them as you mentioned.</p><p>But they have a right to protest. And President Trump is deeply unpopular in the U.K. right now. He's deeply unpopular in Europe. But what he should be doing is sending a message to the people of the U.K. that we will support the U.K. in this difficult time no matter what happens with Brexit.</p><p>And one of the ways he can support the U.K. is to do a bilateral trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K., especially if Brexit does happen and the U.K. leaves the E.U. He's mentioned that a little bit, but that should be the focus. Not the stuff with Meghan Markle and the mayor of London.</p><p>BREAM: Well, of course, Lord Taylor, you know, the president will say, well, Mayor Khan wrote a nasty piece about me in the paper, it's going to be his characterization of it. And he's going to say, you know, I'm being snubbed by the duchess, Meghan Markle. And he's not one to back down from where he thinks there's been an attack or a fight.</p><p>TAFURI: But he needs to be above that, especially because this is about D- Day.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Let me bring in Lord Taylor. Let me bring in Lord Taylor.</p><p>TAYLOR: Yes, I think he's already shown that he's above that. Because he said he wants to do a trade deal with Britain. Once we leave the European Union. After all, you know, we trade with America. It's our biggest trading partner outside Europe. We want to do more trade with America. And he's already said he wants to do this. And we should allow him to do this.</p><p>He is the leader of the free world. Khan is the mayor of London. And I think Trump needs to ignore Khan's nonsense now and focus on the big picture.</p><p>BREAM: OK. I want to play something from a woman there is supporting -- I believe her name is Margaret Lamb. She's talking about why she's there in London to support President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGARET LAMB, TRUMP SUPPORTER FROM HONG KONG: I'm here to support him. Because he support democracy, he support Brexiteer, and we want to be independent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: So, David, you know, the people who voted for Brexit and are supportive of that idea, they have a lot of reasons to like President Trump.</p><p>TAFURI: Well, I suppose they do. I mean, he supported Brexit. But still not clear what's going to happen with the U.K. and Brexit. There's no deal yet.</p><p>And President Trump may actually accidentally hurt the Brexiteers' cause by being so supportive of it. That's, of course, his choice. But I think the better policy for the U.S. is to say that's an issue for the U.K. And for the people of the U.K. And no matter what happens with Brexit, the U.S. will maintain its very strong relationship with the U.K. We will come to the aid of the U.K. We will do a bilateral deal with the U.K. And, of course, most importantly, we'll maintain our intelligence alliance and our military alliance with the U.K.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. And both sides talked about that tonight at this dinner with the queen. A very positive remembrance of our ties that are stronger than, you know, sometimes people would feel they are stressed in situations like this.</p><p>David and Lord Taylor, thank you both very much.</p><p>TAFURI: Thank you.</p><p>TAYLOR: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right. This is a Fox News alert. Congress is back to work tonight as some top Democrats are signaling just a matter of time before they formally begin impeachment proceedings. This reports as some Republicans also are plotting a tariff revolt, while the president is overseas.</p><p>Our senior Capitol Hill producer, Chad Pergram has been working his sources and joins us now to separate fact from fiction. Great to have you always.</p><p>PERGRAM: Thank you for having me, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So let's start here. We heard a lot more Democrats talking about impeachment, kind of the formalities over the weekend about it. So, where do we stand?</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Well, there were about 50 plus who are calling for impeachment. But that's not even a quarter of the House Democratic Caucus. The House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continues to rule that out.</p><p>But we do have a little bit of news here tonight. Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, has noted that next Tuesday, there will be a vote on the House floor on contempt for William Barr, the attorney general, and also for Don McGahn, the former White House counsel.</p><p>We've also learned that this is not going to be inherent contempt where Congress goes and enforces it itself where they go to try to arrest somebody or find them. This will be trying to enforce those subpoenas and they will go through the court.</p><p>Now, the other thing that we don't have resolved here is that they have put a deadline on for the 6th later this week for the House Oversight Committee to possibly hold Barr in contempt over the census question and also the commerce secretary William Ross -- Wilbur Ross. So that might play out later this month, so possibly two shots there, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Well, I mean, the A.G. joked with the speaker about the handcuffs and the whole thing. So it looks like they're not going that route. They're going to go another route on this. Not yet.</p><p>OK. So President Trump getting a lot of pushback now on the idea of these tariffs, what it could do to the U.S. economy as well.</p><p>PERGRAM: Right. We we're hearing some push now that Democrats might try to engineer a vote. Maybe to put some Republicans on the mark and say, are you for the tariffs or not and maybe try to block it.</p><p>Now, I talked to Collin Peterson, he is the chairman of the House agriculture committee. He's a conservative Democrat from Minnesota and he says, you know, these tariffs are hurting our farmers, but it really doesn't matter. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: You have a district that elected you, but voted for President Trump here. What is that doing to people who supported President Trump?</p><p>REP. COLLIN PETERSON (D-MN): There's Donald Trump.</p><p>PERGRAM: Even in spite of all this.</p><p>PETERSON: Yes.</p><p>PERGRAM: Why?</p><p>PETERSON: It's a good question. You'd have to ask them.</p><p>PERGRAM: So, are they willing to vote against their pocketbook?</p><p>PETERSON: They already have now.</p><p>PERGRAM: Explain why they're doing that?</p><p>PETERSON: I can't explain it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: Now, Shannon, what this really means here is that Collin Peterson says they're for Trump, they're for him. I said, \"Well, wait a minute. Why do they not support Democrats who were on the opposite issue on the tariff issue?\" He said, \"Well, I think a lot of these conservative farmers just don't like Democrats.\" And I said, \"Why do they like me?\" He said, \"Well, I'm not normal.\"</p><p>But this is an issue in the south. It's going to be an issue in the 2020 Senate elections. John Cornyn is up for re-election. He represents a state that has some democratic trends there. He says, look, we have a 1,200-mile border with Mexico. He said border security is important but so is trade and that could adversely hit the economy there.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So let's now look at big tech because the House Judiciary Committee making some noise today about investigating groups like Apple, Facebook, Google, some of the big ones out there. What's going on with that?</p><p>PERGRAM: David Cicilline is democratic congressman from Rhode Island. He chairs the subcommittee that deals with anti-trust. And he said a lot of the laws that were written to deal with these big corporations go back to the age of the railroads. They haven't kept up. And he doesn't think that these firms have the wherewithal nor the willingness to work with Congress and work with other people to try to, you know, assure the marketplace.</p><p>So they're going to investigate. This comes as the Department of Justice is also looking at anti-Trust questions for Alphabet, Google, essentially.</p><p>And you know what the issue is here? Is that some of these firms, when you -- when you -- when you consider what they're behemoth and sometimes the marketplace takes care of them and you talk to some of the Democrats who want to go through this investigation, they will say the market isn't working and that's why Congress needs to step in. And that's why David Cicilline says it's time for Congress to act, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: It's going to be a major overhaul to the tech laws, as they now exist, as you mentioned, based on where the foundations of them set long before much of this came along, so.</p><p>PERGRAM: Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Chad Pergram, always great to have you.</p><p>PERGRAM: Thanks for having me. Good to see you.</p><p>BREAM: Thanks for stopping in.</p><p>OK. Top White House economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, is leaving his post. President Trump says he'll announce a replacement when he gets back from his state visit to the U.K.</p><p>The departure comes amid escalating trade tensions with China and the new threat of tariffs on Mexico. And Hassett says they are not connected and that two years is about the usual stay for someone in his current position.</p><p>Well, Democrats say they'll likely subpoena Robert Mueller if he refuses to testify voluntarily. Well, Mueller says his report speaks for itself. So what questions would former oversight chairman Trey Gowdy have for Mueller? I'll ask him when he joins us, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN SWAN, AXIOS POLITICAL REPORTER: This is -- we're talking about Russia here. They are a long-term adversary of the United States, decades of hostility, including spying. Does it not set off at least some alarm bell when you see an e-mail saying that the Russian government wants to help --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Like I -- like said, the e-mail that I got on my iPhone at the time basically said, show up at 4:00. I didn't scroll down. I never would have thought about that --</p><p>SWAN: It had Russia in the -- in the subject line.</p><p>KUSHNER: Again, I would get about 250 e-mails a day. And so I literally saw, show up at 4:00. I showed up at 4:00. But --</p><p>SWAN: Would you call the FBI if it happened again?</p><p>KUSHNER: I don't know. It's hard to do hypotheticals. But the reality is, is that we were not given anything that was salacious.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: OK. A tense exchange between Axios Reporter Jonathan Swan and Senior White House Adviser Jared Kushner about an e-mail which set up the Trump Tower meeting. Kushner says he doesn't know if he would alert the FBI if he got a similar e-mail. He said it's hard to do hypotheticals. Well, let's talk about it now with Fox News Contributor, former South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy. Great to have you with us, sir.</p><p>TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So what do you make of that? I mean, the Mueller report ultimately didn't find to make a finding of collusion or coordination based on that Trump Tower meeting. But you can see there, Jared Kushner is getting some heat for his answers to the question.</p><p>GOWDY: Yes. We spent about 10 hours with Jared when I was on the House Intelligence Committee. He's not a professional witness. Here's what I remember distinctly about it. As soon as he got in the meeting, he started looking for a way to get out of the meeting including texting his administrative assistant and saying, hey, can you come up with some excuse for me to leave?</p><p>What I'm really looking forward to, Shannon, is Jonathan Swan sitting down with the DNC or Perkins Coie or Fusion FPS and asking them not a hypothetical but actually about getting dirt from Russia. Not about a meeting that didn't take place, that Kushner didn't stay at for 15 minutes but the DNC and Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS actually spending lots of money to get the same Russian dirt. I can't wait to hear him ask that question.</p><p>BREAM: Why do you think that question hasn't been asked of some of those players?</p><p>GOWDY: It doesn't fit the narrative? They wanted her to win? I don't know. I -- you know, there is some evidence that the very same Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner briefly met with Glenn Simpson before and after she met with them. But your viewers wouldn't know that because there's been almost no coverage. What they should know is that lots and lots of money was spent by a political party to hire a foreign national to go dig up Russian dirt.</p><p>Not a meeting, not a 15-minute meeting where you get your secretary to get you out of it, but a concerted effort. I think most Americans do equate that. For whatever reason, the D.C. media does not.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So we're also having this conversation in the context of this whole bigger story about whether or not the Special Counsel will be compelled to testify. Former now, Special Counsel Robert Mueller. First to the chairman of the House Intel Committee now, Adam Schiff. Here's what he says.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I think he has one last service to perform. It's not enough merely to speak for 10 minutes and say I'm not going to answer questions for the Congress to the American people. There are great many things that are not in the report.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Now, we increasingly hear that there are some people on the right who do want Mueller to go testify on the Hill. Rudy Giuliani? One of the lawyers to the President says this, if they allow Congressman Meadows and Jordan and a few of the others there, they will eviscerate him more than they did Michael Cohen. In terms of the politics of it, I would love to have him testify, I think he's afraid to. Trey, what would you ask him?</p><p>GOWDY: Well, what I would ask him, did you have enough evidence to indict Donald Trump? Did you not indict him because of the factual deficiency or did you not indict him because he's the President and the Department of Justice has a policy. That'd be the first question. But you can't do it in five minutes. To Rudy Giuliani's frankly absurd point that something constructive would come from the hearing, the Michael Cohen hearing was a disaster.</p><p>The same thing will happen with Mueller because you're limiting yourself to five minutes. So, Shannon, you're an attorney, you would want to ask Mueller, was it a factual deficiency or did you not indict him because legally you could not? And then I'm sure you would pivot at that point to which of these fact patterns constitute obstruction. And you would drill down and to whether or not each of those essential elements was met.</p><p>And then if you had time left over, you would ask him about Peter Strzok and whether you fired him because he was bias or just the appearance of bias. And that now would kind of segue you into well then, why did you hire so many lawyers that donated to Donald Trump's appointment? So -- Donald Trump's opponent. So you would want to do all of that. You couldn't do it in an hour, much less five minutes.</p><p>I hope he doesn't come. I didn't want his report to be made public. Prosecutors don't exonerate people, they don't clear people. They indict or they shut up. He didn't indict so the other option is just to go back into your private life.</p><p>BREAM: Well, you sound like you've put together a road map as somebody who has prosecuted a great many cases. And we'll see. I mean, Schiff has said that if he doesn't come willingly, there's a great possibility of a subpoena. We know many of those are tied up and potential political and legal battles moving forward. So, we'll have you come back and talk about those because there's going to be no shortage of news on this.</p><p>Former Congressman Trey Gowdy, thank you very much always for your time.</p><p>GOWDY: Yes, ma'am, thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Breaking news tonight in the missing Connecticut mom case, chilling new surveillance video revealing potential new clues, next.</p><p>BREAM: Brand new information tonight about a missing mother of five in Connecticut. Officials releasing arrest warrant after Jennifer Dulos' estranged husband and made this first court appearances. Correspondent Trace Gallagher is on the case for us tonight. Good evening, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. Jennifer Dulos went missing in New Canaan, Connecticut and court record say that on the day she disappeared, her estranged husband Fotis Dulos was caught on multiple surveillance cameras about 70 miles away in Hartford getting out of his Ford Raptor and placing several garbage bags into various trash bins.</p><p>The Hartford Courant says the bags and some items inside were stained with Jennifer Dulos' blood. The same surveillance video shows the estranged husband's girlfriend, Michelle Troconis leaning out of the passenger window of the Ford and either placing something on the ground or picking something up. Even more damning, when Jennifer Dulos went missing, police searched her New Canaan home and found a large quantity of physical evidence including multiple human blood stains on the garage floor and blood spatter on the walls.</p><p>There was also evidence that someone tried to clean it up, quoting here based upon the crime scene processing, investigators came to a consensus that a serious physical assault had occurred at the scene and Jennifer Dulos was the suspected victim. Troconis and Dulos both appeared in court today though neither entered a plea. The two apparently became romantically involved about a year before Jennifer Dulos filed for divorce.</p><p>Court documents say the couple has been involved in a bitter custody battle over their five children, ages eight to 13 and that Jennifer Dulos said she was \"Terrified for hair families safety especially since discovering the gun since my husband has a history of controlling, volatile, and delusional behavior.\" She also accused the husband of threatening to kidnap their children and to take them to Greece. Fotis Dulos has pushed back on his wife's allegations, saying she has mental health issues. The girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, is an Argentinian high roller known for interviewing celebrities and opening an upscale Argentine ski resort. She was able to make the $500,000 bail. Fotis Dulos remains behind bars. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Trace Gallagher live on the West Coast. Thank you very much. Well, the House has finally passed a disaster aid package after the bill failed three times over the past week and a half, now each time an individual lawmaker held up the entire process. Also, tonight, a federal judge has thrown out Democrat's lawsuits against President Trump's emergency border wall funding reallocation, saying the issue is fundamentally politically.</p><p>Well, Transportation Department official say Secretary Elaine Chao has been a champion of the American Maritime Industry, but the New York Times is reporting on what some consider uncomfortably close ties between Chao, who's married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and her families shipping dealings in China. Correspondent Doug McKelway has the story and the push back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: A spokesman for Transportation Secretary Elain Chao call today's frontpage New York Time's story \"a lie.\" A source close to Senate Majority Leader Mithc McConnel says it's deeply flawed. The paper alleges that Chao and her husband, McConnell, have used their influence and power to gain mutual benefit from her family's business, the Foremost Group, an American shipping company that does millions of dollars of business with China. Its CEO is Angela Chao, Elaine's sister. She replaced their now-retired father, James, seen here at Chao's confirmation hearing.</p><p>ELAINE CHAO, SECRETARY OF DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION: I'm especially delighted to introduce my father, Dr. James S.C. Chao.</p><p>MCKELWAY: The Times cites this October 2017 e-mail from a U.S. embassy official in China, written to superiors on the eve of Chao's planned visit to Beijing. The body of it is entirely redacted, but the Times quotes people allegedly familiar with the e-mail, including David Ranke, the now retired Deputy Chief Commission in Beijing, who says that Chao asked federal officials to help coordinate travel arrangements for at least one family member and include relatives and meetings with government officials.</p><p>Chao never made the trip. Her office tells Fox News it didn't occur for multiple reasons including scheduling and two meetings at the White House. The story alleges that Chao and Leader McConnell received millions of dollars in campaign contributions and gifts from her father. McConnell acknowledge the legal gifts in the Times story, apparently given after the death of Chao's mother. He said, \"I'm proud to have the support of my family over the years.\" One government watchdog with more than 30 years of experience sums up the Times lengthy expose.</p><p>THOMAS SCHATZ, CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE: It's a giant story about nothing. There's nothing new, there's nothing newsworthy. This story is boring, it's long, and it's really useless.</p><p>MCKELWAY: McConnell's former chief of staff tweeted: \"Imagine for one moment that Elaine Chao was Elaine Johnson and her family emigrated from England. Do you think the New York Times would be interested in publishing that story?\" Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: All right. Doug McKelway, thank you very much. California is being told to brace for widespread blackouts this summer. That tops tonight's \"WESTERN ROUNDUP.\" One of the state's largest power utilities, PG&amp;E is telling customers, don't count on reliable service during fire season. State regulators recently approved the company's plan to imposing massive blackouts this summer in an effort to prevent wildfires.</p><p>An event organizer for Sacramento's Pride Parade asking Sacramento police officers to march in civilian clothes or don't show up -- in an effort to avoid protests from some in the LGBTQ community who say they associated police with negative experiences. The Sacramento Police Department going to bat for gay officers saying, \"they have worked hard to earn these uniforms and are proud to wear them.\"</p><p>And get this, the Swedish-based company, Kangaroo, planning to challenge e- scooters in major cities with an alternative mode of transportation, pogo sticks. The company says this is legit, not a joke. Says it's going to launch its first Pogo sticks in Sweden and hopes to branch out into San Francisco as early as late summer. Kangaroo says Pogo sticks are faster than walking and more environmentally friendly than cars and e-scooters. Going to skip that one.</p><p>OK. Joe Biden skips the California State Democratic Convention, as the left, including most of his 2020 rivals takes aim at the front runner for being too moderate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Those who have chosen for whatever reason not to be in this room...</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Tezlyn Figaro and Harmeet Dhillon break down the growing divide within the Democratic Party, next.</p><p>BREAM: The first major cattle call for 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls and front runner, Joe Biden, was more than 2,000 miles away. And his rivals did not waste the opportunity to go after the former vice president in his absence. Correspondent David Spunt has more on this big event this weekend. Hey, David.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, 24 candidates hoping to oust President Trump. The first debate set for the end of this month. These Democrats trying to make a name for themselves, many in California to do so. But the man on top of the pack decided to skip it altogether.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT: A tough crowd in California, booing at 2020 presidential candidates. John Hickenlooper got an ear full at the California State Democratic Convention.</p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOER, FORMER GOVERNOR OF COLORADO: If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big, progressive goals, socialism is not the answer. I was reelected.</p><p>SPUNT: But Hickenlooper wasn't the only candidate to receive scoffs from the crowd. John Delaney criticized the plan gaining popularity among candidates.</p><p>JOHN DELANEY, FORMER UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: Medicare for All may sound good, but it's actually not good policy nor is it good politics. I'm telling you.</p><p>SPUNT: New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known as an outspoken party progressive took to Twitter telling the White House hopeful: \"John Delaney, thank you but please sashay-away.\" The front runner of the pack, Joe Biden, becoming inescapable subject for candidates.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, MAYOR OF SOUTH BEND: People have seen Democratic and Republican administrations letting them down for basically as long as I've been alive.</p><p>SPUNT: Over the weekend, Biden skipped the California event.</p><p>SANDERS: As you all know, there is a debate among potential candidates who have spoken to you here in this room and those who have chosen or whatever reason not to be in this room.</p><p>SPUNT: The former vice president was in Columbus, Ohio, at a dinner celebrating the human rights campaign.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This White House has literally, literally a bully pulpit, has callously extending its power over the most vulnerable. Implementing discriminatory policies, like Muslin bans; turning away asylum seekers, putting children in cages.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT: Joe Biden's absence could be problematic as California is now more of an important primary state. The primary moved to March 3rd, Tuesday. The hope is to make the Golden State more competitive Shannon, in the nominating process. Hard to believe that debate is just a few weeks away in Miami.</p><p>BREAM: I know, and we'll be there. And we're taking our show in the road.</p><p>SPUNT: Yes.</p><p>BREAM: All right. David, thank you so much.</p><p>SPUNT: Sure, thanks.</p><p>BREAM: OK, progressives, of course, you saw there making the most of Biden's absence taking aim at his more moderate approach. So, let's bring in former Bernie Campaign Staffer Tezlyn Figaro; and the Vice President of the Republican National Lawyers Association Harmeet Dhillon. Ladies, great to have both of you with us tonight.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, VICE PRESIDENT, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION: Thanks, Shannon. Happy to be here.</p><p>BREAM: OK. I want to play a little something that Rush Limbaugh had to say about the folks going after Biden while he was not there in California. He did have another commitment that he told them about. But here's Rush's take.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO HOST: They ripped Biden a new one -- this is within the context of the California State Convention, but wait until it starts happening campaign wide. They don't want to hear about crossing the aisle -- reaching across -- they don't want to hear about that. They want Republicans gone. They want Republicans ended.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Harmeet, and yet he continues polls way ahead the rest of his rivals for now, at least.</p><p>DHILLION: Well, outside the crazy town, San Francisco, where I live, actually, I think people are interested in a more moderate message but I actually don't think that the Democrats are going to allow Joe Biden to be the one to carry that forward. They're really pushing him to the left on many issues. And the extremism on display in my hometown over the weekend was shocking. I'm pretty sure I heard the chance of impeachment and the booing up in my home several miles away.</p><p>Now, you know, the Democrats are out of touch. We're talking about Socialism, we're talking about Medicare for All, we're talking about raising taxes further in California and open borders. So, this is not actually what America thinks -- even Democrats don't think this outside of San Francisco. And I think it's really a poor prospect for them to be focusing on this type of extremism. The nation is not interested in impeachment and it's just kind of a delusion for them to focus on this as opposed to advancing their legislative agenda. Even Nancy Pelosi got booed for her lack of rigor on this issue.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, and we'll, it's interesting, I've read a couple of really good analysis pieces today that talked about the fact that when you go out there and talk to average Democrats across America, they're not down with a lot of the stuff on the left. But right now, those seem to be some of the loudest voices that you're hearing. The Washington Post says this under the headline: \"Liberals go after Joe Biden trying to blunt his presidential candidacy and the recent centrist surge on the Democratic Party.\"</p><p>They say this in the piece: \"The broadsides, they're -- there in California this weekend --- amounted to the loudest warning yet from the party's left flank that it intends to aggressively challenge the centrist ideas and cautious politics that have gained a foothold. Leftist candidates and activists have concluded they can no longer wait for Biden to fade on his own.\" I know, Tezlyn, a lot of people thought he gets in, he's got the name recognition, of course, he's going to be at the head of the pack but he doesn't seem to be flagging at all, yet.</p><p>TEZLYN FIGARO, FORMER BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN STAFFER: Well, this is my concern, you know, and I was critical with Bernie Sanders when he folded like a lawn chair when he was on the stage with Hillary Clinton, when he said no one wants to hear about your damn e-mails. Anybody can talk about somebody around the corner, but where I'm from it's all about if you're going to talk about it to his face. Let's see if the same candidates have the same energy that they have when it's time for debate time. Let's see if Bernie Sanders challenges Joe Biden instead of just saying like some of us who are not in the room. Call it out, Senator Sanders, don't be afraid. I would say man up, but he's 77. So, grandpa up.</p><p>If you have an issue with Joe Biden, speak it. And also, where does he stand on these issues, where do you stand, Senator Sanders? Are you for reparations? Are you not? Are you for fixing the crime bill, are you not? People that I know are not falling for the banana in the tailpipe. You see the division because people are not making clear where they stand. And so, debates, is going to be telling to see where these candidates take their position -- and if he doesn't have the guts, because if he doesn't have the guts to go against old sweet Uncle Joe, he certainly can't take down Trump.</p><p>BREAM: Well, I want to ask you both briefly to respond to the same question. Harmeet, I'll start with you; how do you think this first debate is going to play out with? Right now, I think the number is at 23. I'm not sure exactly how many have qualified to get in, but it's going to be a couple of days of variable stages. All right, we lost Harmeet, so Tezlyn, how about you? Let me know what you think about how this is going to go down with all those people on the stage for days.</p><p>FIGARO: Yes, I think it's going to be more of the let's all just get along and pretend as if, you know, we don't want to challenge anyone because they're afraid to be able to say: you know, hey, I disagree with you. I have no issue, you know, with people having different positions. This is the Democrats process. So, if this is the time for Democrats to really fight it out. And Republicans will have their opportunity to decide if they vote for a Democratic candidate or not. So, the more that they try to avoid the tough questions, the more they try to just say let's all just get along and refuse to actually have a real competitive fight, they're going to continue to see the same problems with the divide within the base.</p><p>BREAM: Tezlyn, you make a great point. We'll see how when they're face- to-face it really goes. Tezlyn Figaro and Harmeet wherever you are in cyberspace, thank you both, great to have you both. All right, President Obama tells audience in Brazil that American gun laws make no sense.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Anybody who buy any weapon anytime, would not much -- if nay --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: OK, he's being fact-checked tonight, though. Jessica Tarlov and Lawrence Jones are here to weigh in with the fact checkers too, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: Some of you may be aware, our gun laws in the United States don't make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon at any time without much, if any regulation. They can buy it over the Internet, they can buy a machine gun.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: OK, former President Barack Obama claiming that anybody at any time can buy a gun in America even machine guns. But multiple fact-checkers or calling out the former commander chief on several of those points tonight. So, let's bring in, Fox News Contributor Jessica Tarlov and Lawrence Jones to discuss. Welcome to you both.</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, there have been a number of articles out there going point by point about all the gun regulations, the fact that you really can buy machine guns, all these things in the fact checks today. Rolling Stone says this: \"Most are strident Second Amendment defenders who are parsing his overall point by making the argument that there are restrictions on what Obama called machine guns,\" those were his words. \"But they know all too well that the type of weapons used in most mass shootings are readily available and they fight to keep laws that allow that truth to remain.\" So, Lawrence, they say, you're taking stuff out of context. It's about trying to keep dangerous guns on the streets.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Like abusers, people that have been adjudicated as mentally unfit can't get guns. I mean, you can't buy guns over the Internet without going through a federal dealer who hasn't -- go through a federal background check. I mean, there were so many things that were just factually inaccurate. And him, as a former President of the United States, and someone who's been fighting against gun legislation for more gun legislation should know something about this. So, I think they're just trying to muddy the waters. But at the end of the day, you know, most people know this stuff right here, Shannon, and you expect the former president to know the law as well.</p><p>BREAM: Well, here's the thing. Daily Wire has this under the headline: \"Obama tells multiple lies about guns in the U.S. to a crowd in Brazil says this: \"Making blatantly false statements about firearms is somewhat of a hobby for Obama as he often lied about firearms during his presidency as tried to push for far-left gun control.\" Now, they go through and walk through two fact checks from the Washington Post, \"not a conservative outlet.\" In 2015 and 2016 rating his statements, then the President Obama's statements false on gun issues. I mean, Jessica, he is a very intelligent guy. He knows the difference. I mean, this almost feels like an unforced error to make such broad statements about this issue.</p><p>TARLOV: I don't think that it really is for the audience that Barack Obama is speaking to. I'm not talking about the Brazilians that were in the audience but those of us back home who feel similarly that there are too many powerful weapons in the hands of people who shouldn't have them. If you listen to the prime minister of New Zealand for instance, who gave an interview over the weekend about this, said she absolutely doesn't understand how a country that has the most mass shootings of any nation on earth doesn't then turn around and change the laws.</p><p>I think what Barack Obama was also speaking to is the fact that we've recently even had two shootings in (INAUDIBLE) and Sutherland Springs, where the people who perpetrated those crimes had committed domestic violence. When you look at what happened in Las Vegas, the fact that person -- the shooter was able to amass dozens of weapons because he didn't have to register those rifles, that's when you get to these conversations about having a national gun registry.</p><p>BREAM: But I think if he is going to talk about these things and people are going to have a conversation, you have to deal from a factual basis. I think you can be emotional and think that something needs to be changed and things need to be done. But you know, we took note of what's going on in Chicago which has some of the toughest gun laws in the country and a horrible weekend there, I think we might have some stats on that. I mean, there's a situation where they had their most violent weekend, at least ten people dead, dozens of other people wounded in these attacks. I mean, Lawrence, we can have a conversation at least we have to be truthful about the state of gun laws in this country.</p><p>JONES: Yes, especially when you're lying intentionally to the American public. I think that's also concerning. But again, shocker, criminals don't abide by gun laws. I mean, look, I understand, we have to have some national conversation when it comes to a lot of these shootings. But in reality, legislators don't know what to do because, guess what? Criminals are going to always be able to get guns. They're not abiding by the gun laws. So, the conversation needs to be now that we know that we're not going to agree on gun legislation, what do we do to protect our kids? May be putting metal detectors on our schools, securing our buildings like we secure banks, and the president of the United States. That should be where the conversation is going. Instead, we want to go back and forth on what we believe the Second Amendment represents lies.</p><p>BREAM: Let me bring Jessica in here for a final word.</p><p>TARLOV: Well, obviously, obviously I'm a pollster by training. I'm a big believer in the facts and in using numbers accurately, that's why I said I think that what Obama was trying to get to is the larger conversation here. Chicago is undoubtedly a tragedy. Mayor Lightfoot who was just sworn in has a big task ahead and she campaigned specifically on this. It's important, though, to go back to a 2017 study which showed that over 60 percent of the firearms that are used in these crimes came from out of state. Also, 95 percent of the weapons that are used were not secured by the person who's using them. So, that's to Lawrence point. People are going to commit crimes. We have to look at this holistically and treat the problem at the root.</p><p>BREAM: We're going to leave it there.</p><p>JONES: The facts matter though.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, they do. We both all agree to that.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes, that's why I just gave you a bunch of that.</p><p>BREAM: OK, we got to leave it there. Jessica and Lawrence, thank you both very much.</p><p>TARLOV: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\" next.</p><p>JONES: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, check this out. Deputy Adams (INAUDIBLE) with the (INAUDIBLE) County Sheriff's Department in Tennessee was out on patrol when he spotted this couple asleep on a dirt road along with a rattlesnake. Look at it, right by them. All right, he woke them up trying to keep them calm; he told them to stay put.</p><p>Well, the guy did probably what I would've done. He gets up and takes off. In the end, everyone was safe. The dash cam tells the story. Deputy (INAUDIBLE), for your composure in the face of danger, you're our \"MIDNIGHT HERO.\" I have so many questions. Most watched, most trusted, most grateful you spent the evening with us. Good night from Washington. I'm Shannon Bream.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019060301cb259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W88-VRS1-DXH2-634D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Political</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>State Visit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Impeachment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>iPhone</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FBI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jared Kushner</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Perkins Coie</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fusion FPS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Natalia Veselnitskaya</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Glenn Simpson</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jennifer Dulos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fotis Dulos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hartford Courant</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Michelle Troconis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elaine Chao</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mitch McConnell</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrat</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bernie Sanders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Barack Obama</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gun Laws</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Second Amendment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chicago</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

There is, however, one exception: the new agreement says the U.S., Mexico and Canada can enact \u201cmeasures necessary to protect public morals\u201d and hold tech companies liable for content that facilitates sex trafficking, child trafficking and prostitution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The agreement mimics Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which several libertarian experts have praised for protecting tech companies from liabilities and lawsuits related to the content curated on their sites. The Electronic Frontier Foundation calls the CDA\u2019s Section 230 the \u201cmost important law protecting internet speech.\u201d</p><p> That protection ends when it comes to sex trafficking. The new USMCA specifically references the US.\u2019 amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 , passed earlier this year, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (commonly referred to as FOSTA), which Silicon Valley lobbied against.</p><p> FOSTA was the result of an 18-month Senate investigation into Backpage.com, a website notorious for facilitating online sex trafficking and sexual exploitation of children. Thanks to FOSTA, tech companies can be held liable for knowingly running ads for sex trafficking and child sex.</p><p> Lisa Thompson, vice president of research and education at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, said neglecting to hold tech companies liable for this in the new NAFTA agreement would encourage cross-border sex trafficking, which has increased rapidly over the past 10 years, especially at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p> Simply copy-and-pasting Section 230 language into the new NAFTA agreement, she wrote in an op-ed for The Hill, would \u201cbe nothing short of a sex-trafficking apocalypse.\u201d</p><p> Silicon Valley - including many tech publications and libertarian voices - decried FOSTA for restricting internet freedom, and Google lobbied earnestly against its passage. The tech industry also lobbied for the new NAFTA agreement to include Section 230 language without caveats. According to a Quartz report, internet and tech companies and associations spent $38 million on lobbying through August this year.</p><p> According to two lawyers in an analysis published by Bloomberg, \u201cThe safe harbor [of Section 230] has always been a double-edged sword. For platforms, the task of monitoring user content and responding to demands to remove defamatory or otherwise unlawful thirdparty content could easily become so onerous as to be infeasible. On the other hand, for parties aggrieved by unlawful postings, it can be immensely difficult to cause an unresponsive platform to remove even obviously wrongful - even demonstrably illegal - content or speech.\u201d</p><p> In an August 2017 letter to congressional staffers, Google lobbyist Stewart Jeffries wrote that FOSTA \u201chas the potential to seriously jeopardize the internet ecosystem\u201d and \u201cundercut[s] one of the foundational statutes for the Internet: Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\u201d</p><p> During Google\u2019s Q2 2018, Jeffries lobbied the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on behalf of Google on a number of issues related to the NAFTA (now USMCA) renegotiation, like \u201cfreedom of expression and free flow of information,\u201d as well as lobbying Congress over \u201canti-human trafficking\u201d and FOSTA.</p><p> Aware of the tech industry\u2019s push, rescued victims of sex trafficking sent a letter to Congress in September asking for the \u201cSection 230-like language\u201d in the new NAFTA agreement to be modi?ed to hold internet and tech companies liable for \u201cknowingly facilitating\u201d sex trafficking.</p><p> Beyond Borders FLPAT Canada, a national advocacy organization seeking to end exploitation of children, said Canadian representatives in the NAFTA renegotiation responded to concerns \u201cthat the agreement might include a blanket prohibition which would prevent Canada from imposing liability on internet providers for content. We are pleased to see that the agreement would allow Canada to hold internet providers liable for online sexual exploitation of children.\u201d</p><p> Beyond Borders ECPAT Canada also applauded FOSTA earlier this year.</p><p> While the USMCA is still a huge win for Silicon Valley, the tech industry\u2019s resistance to anti-sex trafficking efforts may only strengthen anti-Big Tech sentiments in Washington as scrutiny of some of the major players</p><p> - like Google, Facebook and Twitter intensifies.</p><p> EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Kate Patrick reports technology and ?nance news for InsideSources.

But a government ban on flavored vapes and increased regulation could wipe them out and leave an opening for Big Tobacco and big tech to dominate the fast-growing industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tobacconists - the broader category  that includes vape shops - have lapped every other retail segment since 2009 thanks to an explosion of tiny businesses, Labor Department data show.</p><p> Two-thirds of vape-shop workers are employed by the 93% of businesses with fewer than 10 employees - a higher rate than for any other retail segment.</p><p> Yelp's vast databases, which allow us to break out segments not yet tracked by the government, agree. Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing large retail segment tracked by the online review site. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state.</p><p> The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping related, has killed at least seven people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net.</p><p> In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices. The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner.</p><p> Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options.</p><p> On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Michigan, plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons  its Facebook page, and  its website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine).</p><p> But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\"</p><p> The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval  that its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse.</p><p> Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, New York. \"After the mom and pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria.</p><p> Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At vape shops, customers often taper to lower and lower nicotine concentrations, until they're vaping a zero-nicotine product. Eventually, some will quit entirely.</p><p> But while adult smokers seem to have benefited from the vaping boom, officials point to a worrying spike in teen use.</p><p> \"I know the governor is worried about kids,\" Brown said. \"What about my kids? I've got two kids at home. I'm going to lose my job if they ban flavored vape juice.\"</p><p> Vaping</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-35225020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X45-RPD1-DYFF-817X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 24, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002FVJ</classCode><className>IRON MOUNTAIN INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS561990 ALL OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

But in the data, they are something else: a miraculous small-business success story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mom-and-pop vape shops are the fastest-growing retail segment of the past decade, as well as the one with the highest share of employees at small businesses. But a government ban on flavored vapes and increased regulation could wipe them out and leave an opening for Big Tobacco and big tech to dominate the fast-growing industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tobacconists - the broader category that includes vape shops - have lapped every other retail segment since 2009, thanks to an explosion of tiny businesses, Labor Department data show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two thirds of vape-shop workers are employed by the 93 percent of businesses with fewer than 10 employees - a higher rate than for any other retail segment.</p><p>Yelp's vast databases, which allow us to break out segments not yet tracked by the government, agree. Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing large retail segment tracked by the online review site. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state.</p><p>The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping-related, has killed at least 7 people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net.</p><p>In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices. The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner.</p><p>Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options.</p><p>On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Mich., plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons its Facebook page, and its website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine).</p><p>But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, the shops are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\"</p><p>The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. In May of next year, the Food and Drug Administration will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval that its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse.</p><p>Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, N.Y. \"After the mom-and-pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria.</p><p>Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, University of Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said.</p><p>Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated itemsas tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transportation challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the United States, according to figures from the book \"American Breweries II\" provided by the Brewers Association.</p><p>But the rise of lager-style beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers. In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained.</p><p>\"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association. \"The companies that survived were the ones that were able to rapidly shift markets and weather the storm.\" He pointed out that Yuengling, for example, entered the ice cream business during the lean years.</p><p>Those bigger players swung back into the industry when Prohibition ended, because they were positioned to navigate costly state and local regulations that proliferated in the wake of repeal. It consolidated their advantage. By 1978, there were 89 brewers in the country.</p><p>In that same year, regulations finally eased. President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that legalized home brewing. In the years that followed, states relaxed their brewpub bans, Watson said. There were more than 1,500 U.S. breweries by the year 2000, and by 2018 there were 7,450.</p><p>There is an important caveat, however. A few enormous corporations still sell six out of every seven U.S. beers, leaving about 7,447 craft brewers to split the remaining 14 percent of the market.</p><p>\"These regulatory decisions that were made a long time ago have very long historical trajectories,\" Watson said.</p><p>Heavyweights like Anheuser-Busch InBev (41 percent of the market) and Molson Coors (23.5 percent) have also elbowed into the craft beer boom, snapping up smaller brewers and distributing their beverages under myriad craft labels.</p><p>We are seeing echoes of that in the vaping industry. Late last year, Altria sought to regain lost ground with a $12.8 billion investment in Juul. It also acquired 45 percent of a Canadian marijuana firm.</p><p>Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At vape shops, customers often taper to lower and lower nicotine concentrations, until they are vaping a zero-nicotine product. Eventually, some will quit.</p><p>But while adult smokers seem to have benefited from the vaping boom, officials point to a worrying spike in teen use. A 2018 survey found 37.3 percent of high school seniors had vaped at some point in the prior year, up from 27.8 percent in 2017. Only 3.6 percent of them reported smoking cigarettes daily.</p><p>Brown said age restrictions and better enforcement could keep flavored vape juices out of kids' hands without threatening his mission and livelihood.</p><p>\"I know the governor is worried about kids,\" Brown said. \"What about my kids? I've got two kids at home. I'm going to lose my job if they ban flavored vape juice.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-b87a8f0469c840cd942cd785b8e1d457</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X41-8061-DXKP-J2NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1319\"/><timeReceived>2:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 23, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002FVJ</classCode><className>IRON MOUNTAIN INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS561990 ALL OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

He accused them of having a \"unchecked power to censor, restrict, mold, hide, alter virtually any form of communication.\"</p><p><br/><br/>The President confirmed to reporters at the White House that he had signed it, but the text has not yet been revealed. Trump, who was accompanied by Justice Secretary William Barr, said, \"We are here to defend the press freedom of one of the greatest dangers facing American history,\" he told and accused social media companies of having \"unchecked power to censor, restrict, mold, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.\"<br/><br/>He said that \"a small and powerful social media monopoly controls a vast public and private communications population in the United States and we know who they are, we don't have to name them, we're going to give them a complete list.\"<br/><br/>He also noted that Twitter makes \"editorial decisions\" and is no longer a \"neutral platform\" but an editor \"with a point of view\" and has a \"political activism.\" And that you can say the same thing about Facebook, Google and others.<br/><br/>\"Imagine if your phone company silenced or edited your conversations. Companies have much greater power and more reach than any phone company in the United States,\" he added.<br/><br/>The decree is a new step in the President's war against social media, but mostly against Twitter. Trump had given a clue Wednesday night that he would take some action with a tweet: \"Big tech companies are doing everything in their power to pre-CENSURE the 2020 election,\" he wrote. \"If this happens, we will no longer have our freedom. I'll never let this happen! They tried in 2016 and didn't lose. Now they're getting absolutely CRAZY. Stay tuned!\" The Bloomberg agency issued a draft executive order that Trump would announce. According to the document, the initiative could bring a barrage of lawsuits about social media companies because it lifts certain government protections that these companies have with respect to user posts.<br/><br/>This kind of legal shield is applied based on the alleged \"good faith\" that companies have to remove or limit the visibility of certain tweets, videos or posts on social networks. But the term \"good faith\" is not defined by the regulations. The draft would then order the Federal Communications Commission to define that expression, which could open legal gaps so that thousands of users can initiate lawsuits.<br/><br/>According to The New York Times, \"the decree, which officials said was still being drafted and subject to change, would make it easier for federal regulators to argue that companies like Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter are suppressing freedom of expression when they mobilize to suspend users or delete posts, among other examples.\"<br/><br/>The decree, according to Bloomberg, also states that the President will create, through the Department of Justice, a working group of state justice ministers to review misleading practices and review government spending on notices on those platforms.<br/><br/>The decree can open a huge legal battle between Washington and Silicon Valley.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paula</emphasis>Lugones is a journalist, correspondent for El Clar\u00edn in Washington<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-12677018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603T-V0N1-DY1R-B4TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 10, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump alleged that ballots would be stolen and forged on an epic scale. \"This will be a Rigged Election,\" he added.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was little evidence to back up his claims: Justin Levitt of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles analysed more than one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He found 31 incidents of identity fraud.</p><p>Twitter - which for years has allowed its most famous user to rant, rave, bully and bluster uninterrupted - decided, finally, to wade in. The $24bn company slapped \"fact-check\" links under his tweets. The president and his allies swiftly labelled the move \"censorship\" - even though it was, in truth, a baby step. His tweets were not removed or edited. Instead, the president's favoured digital bullhorn appended a link in small print encouraging readers to \"get the facts\" about postal voting.</p><p>The following day, Trump signed an executive order telling regulators to strip legal immunity from companies found to have restricted certain voices on their platforms, specifically naming Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p><p>The move threatens to knee-cap the law upon which the modern web - and the empires that dominate it - are built. It sets the stage for an all-out war that experts say may actually delay long-running efforts to hold the Silicon Valley giants to account.</p><p>Daniel Gross, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, said the order could be a \"Franz Ferdinand moment\" (the Austrian archduke whose assassination triggered the First World War) as social media companies go to battle with the government over the future of the internet - and their businesses. Tech trade groups are understood to have filed a federal lawsuit to strike down the order.</p><p>Hany Farid, a University of California computer science professor and a critic of the industry, said: \"There is a path forward to holding the sector more accountable for the harm [caused by] their services, while encouraging an open and free exchange of ideas. This executive order is not a productive part of that path.\"</p><p>The cornerstone of the web is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 1996. The law, passed when less than 10% of America or Britain had internet access, gives blanket immunity to platforms for content posted by users. As terrorism, child sexual abuse, misinformation, propaganda and conspiracies have spread across social media, calls for greater accountability have increasingly focused on either repealing Section 230 or carving it up to so that platforms can indeed be held liable for certain content.</p><p>The industry has fought those efforts tooth and nail. Trump has now put Section 230 in the line of fire. He has also exposed fault lines between the tech giants and revealed how politically charged the issue of online expression has become just months before what is sure to be a bitterly fought election.</p><p>Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg went on conservative news channel Fox News to bash Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, saying: \"Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\" To wit, the president posted the exact same Twitter messages on Facebook. Facebook left them up.</p><p>It did the same after violent protests broke out over the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" Trump had tweeted. Twitter covered it with a warning about tweets that \"glorify violence\", next to a button that allowed readers to view the message. Zuckerberg left it up.</p><p>The Facebook chief explained: \"I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately, accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinised out in the open.\"</p><p>(Trump later sought to clarify the post, claiming it was a warning against violence rather than a promotion of it.) Zuckerberg's position struck many as inconsistent. Just last month, the 36-yearold boasted of how Facebook had labelled 50 million posts \"misinformation\" about the coronavirus pandemic. Farid said: \"The hypocrisy of his statement ... Two weeks ago, you're bragging about labelling misinformation, and the moment Trump pounces on Twitter, you're like, 'Oh yeah, we don't do that.' \" A recent expos\u00e9 by The Wall Street Journal revealed how Facebook's own research made it clear that its algorithms were increasing social division, but that Zuckerberg chose to kill an effort to improve the quality of discourse because it might hurt growth.</p><p>As for the order itself, legal scholars reckon it has little chance of surviving the courts. The order empowers the Federal Communications Commission to assess whether editorial decisions are made in \"good faith\" or to \"stifle viewpoints with which they disagree\". The definition of good faith is vague, but if the FCC does determine that a tech company has acted unfairly, it can, in effect, remove the immunity provided by Section 230 - not just for the post in question, but for all content. This, potentially, could expose the companies to lawsuits.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-governmental organisation and ardent defender of Section 230, dubbed Trump's move an \"error-filled reading\" of the law that was, in fact, \"a transparent attempt to retaliate against Twitter for its decision to curate (well, really just to factcheck) his posts\".</p><p>With or without Trump's intervention, the chipping away at Section 230 has already begun. It is a rare issue where Democrats and Republicans have found a common cause. Farid labelled the law the \"ultimate gift\" because it provides a level of protection that no other industry enjoys.</p><p>A pharmaceuticals company that sells poisonous pills can be successfully sued; social media companies may help foment terrorism or promote fake medicine, but they are virtually impervious - as shown by a growing number of successful defences in court.</p><p>The first real dent in Section 230 came in 2018, when Congress passed an act to hold platforms liable for hosting posts used for child sex trafficking. Internet purists warned it would bring about the end of the web as we know it. It was a slippery slope that would kill free speech, they argued. Two years on, the web still exists - and Big Tech is bigger than ever.</p><p>Reformers are concerned, though, that Trump's act of political theatre may undermine efforts that have been building in the background. Farid said: \"It's the worst possible timing. The Department of Justice was literally days away from releasing suggestions on reforming 230.\"</p><p>The EARN IT Act, which would peel back Section 230 protections related to child sexual abuse, has been gaining momentum in the US Senate.</p><p>Farid added: \"This in many ways derails those very thoughtful conversations because it introduces this highly partisan component - and that is never going to end well for anybody.\"</p><p>On Friday, Trump took to Twitter again. He wrote: \"REVOKE 230!\" THANK THE WOLF OF WALL STREET The internet as we know it today has taken shape thanks largely to one man: the Wolf of Wall Street.</p><p>Jordan Belfort, the fraudster depicted by Leonardo DiCaprio, below with co-star Margot Robbie, in Martin Scorsese's film, founded Stratton Oakmont. His brokerage sued Prodigy, an internet services provider, for defamation after an anonymous user on message boards accused Belfort of fraud. Stratton won. The court ruled that Prodigy was a publisher that exerted editorial control over content on its pages, and was thus liable. Two congressmen were concerned about the precedent it might set. Senator Ron Wyden and Christopher Cox presented a bill to protect websites from liability for what users might post on their pages. It became Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, suddenly the hottest topic in US legal circles.</p><p>The law powered the rise of empires such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook, which traffic in usergenerated content and have seen growth explode without having to worry about being legally accountable, as newspapers or radio stations are. Wyden, who remains in Congress, said last week that Donald Trump's executive order to potentially roll back Section 230 was \"plainly illegal\".</p><p>There is a path to holding the sector more accountable for harm caused.

Trump alleged that ballots would be stolen and forged on an epic scale. \"This will be a Rigged Election,\" he added.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was little evidence to back up his claims: Justin Levitt of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles analysed more than one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He found 31 incidents of identity fraud.</p><p>Twitter - which for years has allowed its most famous user to rant, rave, bully and bluster uninterrupted - decided, finally, to wade in. The $24bn company slapped \"fact-check\" links under his tweets. The president and his allies swiftly labelled the move \"censorship\" - even though it was, in truth, a baby step. His tweets were not removed or edited. Instead, the president's favoured digital bullhorn appended a link in small print encouraging readers to \"get the facts\" about postal voting.</p><p>The following day, Trump signed an executive order telling regulators to strip legal immunity from companies found to have restricted certain voices on their platforms, specifically naming Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p><p>The move threatens to knee-cap the law upon which the modern web - and the empires that dominate it - are built. It sets the stage for an all-out war that experts say may actually delay long-running efforts to hold the Silicon Valley giants to account.</p><p>Daniel Gross, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, said the order could be a \"Franz Ferdinand moment\" (the Austrian archduke whose assassination triggered the First World War) as social media companies go to battle with the government over the future of the internet - and their businesses. Tech trade groups are understood to be readying a federal lawsuit to strike down the order.</p><p>Hany Farid, a University of California computer science professor and a critic of the industry, said: \"There is a path forward to holding the sector more accountable for the harm [caused by] their services, while encouraging an open and free exchange of ideas. This executive order is not a productive part of that path.\"</p><p>The cornerstone of the web is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 1996. The law, passed when less than 10% of America or Britain had internet access, gives blanket immunity to platforms for content posted by users. As terrorism, child sexual abuse, misinformation, propaganda and conspiracies have spread across social media, calls for greater accountability have increasingly focused on either repealing Section 230 or carving it up to so that platforms can indeed be held liable for certain content.</p><p>The industry has fought those efforts tooth and nail. Trump has now put Section 230 in the line of fire. He has also exposed fault lines between the tech giants and how politically charged the issue of online expression has become just months before what is sure to be a bitterly fought election.</p><p>Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg went on conservative news channel Fox News to bash Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, saying: \"Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\" To wit, the president posted the exact same Twitter messages on Facebook. Facebook left them up.</p><p>It did the same after violent protests broke out over the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" Trump had tweeted. Twitter covered it with a warning about tweets that \"glorify violence\", next to a button that allowed readers to view the message. Zuckerberg left it up.</p><p>The Facebook chief explained: \"I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately, accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinised out in the open.\"</p><p>(Trump later sought to clarify the post, claiming it was a warning against violence rather than a promotion of it.) Zuckerberg's position struck many as inconsistent. Just last month, the 36-yearold boasted of how Facebook had labelled 50 million posts \"misinformation\" about the coronavirus pandemic. Farid said: \"The hypocrisy of his statement ... Two weeks ago, you're bragging about labelling misinformation, and the moment Trump pounces on Twitter, you're like, 'Oh yeah, we don't do that.' \" A recent expos\u00e9 by The Wall Street Journal revealed how Facebook's own research made it clear that its algorithms were increasing social division, but that Zuckerberg chose to water down efforts to improve the quality of discourse because it might hurt growth.</p><p>As for the order itself, legal scholars reckon it has little chance of surviving the courts. The order empowers the Federal Communications Commission to assess whether editorial decisions are made in \"good faith\" or to \"stifle viewpoints with which they disagree\". The definition of good faith is vague, but if the FCC does determine that a tech company has acted unfairly, it can, in effect, remove the immunity provided by Section 230 - not just for the post in question, but for all content. This, potentially, could expose the companies to lawsuits.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-governmental organisation and ardent defender of Section 230, dubbed Trump's move an \"error-filled reading\" of the law that was, in fact, \"a transparent attempt to retaliate against Twitter for its decision to curate (well, really just to fact-check) his posts\".</p><p>With or without Trump's intervention, the chipping away at Section 230 has already begun. It is a rare issue where Democrats and Republicans have found a common cause. Farid labelled the law the \"ultimate gift\" because it provides a level of protection that no other industry enjoys.</p><p>A pharmaceuticals company that sells poisonous pills can be successfully sued; social media companies may help foment terrorism or promote fake medicine, but they are virtually impervious - as shown by a growing number of successful defences in court.</p><p>The first real dent in Section 230 came in 2018, when Congress passed an act to hold platforms liable for hosting posts used for child sex trafficking. Internet purists warned it would bring about the end of the web as we know it. It was a slippery slope that would kill free speech, they argued. Two years on, the web still exists - and Big Tech is bigger than ever.</p><p>Reformers are concerned, though, that Trump's act of political theatre may undermine efforts that have been building in the background. Farid said: \"It's the worst possible timing. The Department of Justice was literally days away from releasing suggestions on reforming 230.\"</p><p>The EARN IT Act, which would peel back Section 230 protections related to child sexual abuse, has been gaining momentum in the US Senate.</p><p>Farid added: \"This in many ways derails those very thoughtful conversations because it introduces this highly partisan component - and that is never going to end well for anybody.\"</p><p>On Friday, Trump took to Twitter again. He wrote: \"REVOKE 230!\" THANK THE WOLF OF WALL STREET The internet as we know it today has taken shape thanks largely to one man: the Wolf of Wall Street.</p><p>Jordan Belfort, the fraudster depicted by Leonardo DiCaprio, below with co-star Margot Robbie, in Martin Scorsese's film, founded Stratton Oakmont. His brokerage sued Prodigy, an internet services provider, for defamation after an anonymous user on message boards accused Belfort of fraud. Stratton won. The court ruled that Prodigy was a publisher that exerted editorial control over content on its pages, and was thus liable. Two congressmen were concerned about the precedent it might set. Senator Ron Wyden and Christopher Cox wrote a statute to protect websites from liability for what users might post on their pages. It became Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, suddenly the hottest topic in US legal circles.</p><p>The law powered the rise of empires such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook, which traffic in usergenerated content and have seen growth explode without having to worry about being legally accountable, as newspapers or radio stations are. Wyden, who remains in Congress, said last week that Donald Trump's executive order to potentially roll back Section 230 was \"plainly illegal\".</p><p>There is a path to holding the sector more accountable for harm caused.

Trump alleged that ballots would be stolen and forged on an epic scale. \"This will be a Rigged Election,\" he added.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was little evidence to back up his claims: Justin Levitt of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles analysed more than one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He found 31 incidents of identity fraud.</p><p>Twitter - which for years has allowed its most famous user to rant, rave, bully and bluster uninterrupted - decided, finally, to wade in. The $24bn company slapped \"fact-check\" links under his tweets. The president and his allies swiftly labelled the move \"censorship\" - even though it was, in truth, a baby step. His tweets were not removed or edited. Instead, the president's favoured digital bullhorn appended a link in small print encouraging readers to \"get the facts\" about postal voting.</p><p>The following day, Trump signed an executive order telling regulators to strip legal immunity from companies found to have restricted certain voices on their platforms, specifically naming Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p><p>The move threatens to knee-cap the law upon which the modern web - and the empires that dominate it - are built. It sets the stage for an all-out war that experts say may actually delay long-running efforts to hold the Silicon Valley giants to account.</p><p>Daniel Gross, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, said the order could be a \"Franz Ferdinand moment\" (the Austrian archduke whose assassination triggered the First World War) as social media companies go to battle with the government over the future of the internet - and their businesses. Tech trade groups are understood to have filed a federal lawsuit to strike down the order.</p><p>Hany Farid, a University of California computer science professor and a critic of the industry, said: \"There is a path forward to holding the sector more accountable for the harm [caused by] their services, while encouraging an open and free exchange of ideas. This executive order is not a productive part of that path.\"</p><p>The cornerstone of the web is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 1996. The law, passed when less than 10% of America or Britain had internet access, gives blanket immunity to platforms for content posted by users. As terrorism, child sexual abuse, misinformation, propaganda and conspiracies have spread across social media, calls for greater accountability have increasingly focused on either repealing Section 230 or carving it up to so that platforms can indeed be held liable for certain content.</p><p>The industry has fought those efforts tooth and nail. Trump has now put Section 230 in the line of fire. He has also exposed fault lines between the tech giants and revealed how politically charged the issue of online expression has become just months before what is sure to be a bitterly fought election.</p><p>Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg went on conservative news channel Fox News to bash Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, saying: \"Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\" To wit, the president posted the exact same Twitter messages on Facebook. Facebook left them up.</p><p>It did the same after violent protests broke out over the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" Trump had tweeted. Twitter covered it with a warning about tweets that \"glorify violence\", next to a button that allowed readers to view the message. Zuckerberg left it up.</p><p>The Facebook chief explained: \"I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately, accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinised out in the open.\"</p><p>(Trump later sought to clarify the post, claiming it was a warning against violence rather than a promotion of it.) Zuckerberg's position struck many as inconsistent. Just last month, the 36-yearold boasted of how Facebook had labelled 50 million posts \"misinformation\" about the coronavirus pandemic. Farid said: \"The hypocrisy of his statement \u2026 Two weeks ago, you're bragging about labelling misinformation, and the moment Trump pounces on Twitter, you're like, 'Oh yeah, we don't do that.' \" A recent expos\u00e9 by The Wall Street Journal revealed how Facebook's own research made it clear that its algorithms were increasing social division, but that Zuckerberg chose to kill an effort to improve the quality of discourse because it might hurt growth.</p><p>As for the order itself, legal scholars reckon it has little chance of surviving the courts. The order empowers the Federal Communications Commission to assess whether editorial decisions are made in \"good faith\" or to \"stifle viewpoints with which they disagree\". The definition of good faith is vague, but if the FCC does determine that a tech company has acted unfairly, it can, in effect, remove the immunity provided by Section 230 - not just for the post in question, but for all content. This, potentially, could expose the companies to lawsuits.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-governmental organisation and ardent defender of Section 230, dubbed Trump's move an \"error-filled reading\" of the law that was, in fact, \"a transparent attempt to retaliate against Twitter for its decision to curate (well, really just to factcheck) his posts\".</p><p>With or without Trump's intervention, the chipping away at Section 230 has already begun. It is a rare issue where Democrats and Republicans have found a common cause. Farid labelled the law the \"ultimate gift\" because it provides a level of protection that no other industry enjoys.</p><p>A pharmaceuticals company that sells poisonous pills can be successfully sued; social media companies may help foment terrorism or promote fake medicine, but they are virtually impervious - as shown by a growing number of successful defences in court.</p><p>The first real dent in Section 230 came in 2018, when Congress passed an act to hold platforms liable for hosting posts used for child sex trafficking. Internet purists warned it would bring about the end of the web as we know it. It was a slippery slope that would kill free speech, they argued. Two years on, the web still exists - and Big Tech is bigger than ever.</p><p>Reformers are concerned, though, that Trump's act of political theatre may undermine efforts that have been building in the background. Farid said: \"It's the worst possible timing. The Department of Justice was literally days away from releasing suggestions on reforming 230.\"</p><p>The EARN IT Act, which would peel back Section 230 protections related to child sexual abuse, has been gaining momentum in the US Senate.</p><p>Farid added: \"This in many ways derails those very thoughtful conversations because it introduces this highly partisan component - and that is never going to end well for anybody.\"</p><p>On Friday, Trump took to Twitter again. He wrote: \"REVOKE 230!\" THANK THE WOLF OF WALL STREET The internet as we know it today has taken shape thanks largely to one man: the Wolf of Wall Street.</p><p>Jordan Belfort, the fraudster depicted by Leonardo DiCaprio, below with co-star Margot Robbie, in Martin Scorsese's film, founded Stratton Oakmont. His brokerage sued Prodigy, an internet services provider, for defamation after an anonymous user on message boards accused Belfort of fraud. Stratton won. The court ruled that Prodigy was a publisher that exerted editorial control over content on its pages, and was thus liable. Two congressmen were concerned about the precedent it might set. Senator Ron Wyden and Christopher Cox presented a bill to protect websites from liability for what users might post on their pages. It became Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, suddenly the hottest topic in US legal circles.</p><p>The law powered the rise of empires such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook, which traffic in usergenerated content and have seen growth explode without having to worry about being legally accountable, as newspapers or radio stations are. Wyden, who remains in Congress, said last week that Donald Trump's executive order to potentially roll back Section 230 was \"plainly illegal\".</p><p>There is a path to holding the sector more accountable for harm caused. This is not part of it</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-160368657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601F-GX11-DYTY-C4RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 31, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump alleged that ballots would be stolen and forged on an epic scale. \"This will be a Rigged Election,\" he added.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was little evidence to back up his claims: Justin Levitt of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles analysed more than one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014. He found 31 incidents of identity fraud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter - which for years has allowed its most famous user to rant, rave, bully and bluster uninterrupted - decided, finally, to wade in. The $24bn company slapped \"fact-check\" links under his tweets. The president and his allies swiftly labelled the move \"censorship\" - even though it was, in truth, a baby step. His tweets were not removed or edited. Instead, the president's favoured digital bullhorn appended a link in small print encouraging readers to \"get the facts\" about postal voting.</p><p>The following day, Trump signed an executive order telling regulators to strip legal immunity from companies found to have restricted certain voices on their platforms, specifically naming Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p><p>The move threatens to knee-cap the law upon which the modern web - and the empires that dominate it - are built. It sets the stage for an all-out war that experts say may actually delay long-running efforts to hold the Silicon Valley giants to account.</p><p>Daniel Gross, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, said the order could be a \"Franz Ferdinand moment\" (the Austrian archduke whose assassination triggered the First World War) as social media companies go to battle with the government over the future of the internet - and their businesses. Tech trade groups are understood to be readying a federal lawsuit to strike down the order.</p><p>Hany Farid, a University of California computer science professor and a critic of the industry, said: \"There is a path forward to holding the sector more accountable for the harm [caused by] their services, while encouraging an open and free exchange of ideas. This executive order is not a productive part of that path.\"</p><p>The cornerstone of the web is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 1996. The law, passed when less than 10% of America or Britain had internet access, gives blanket immunity to platforms for content posted by users. As terrorism, child sexual abuse, misinformation, propaganda and conspiracies have spread across social media, calls for greater accountability have increasingly focused on either repealing Section 230 or carving it up to so that platforms can indeed be held liable for certain content.</p><p>The industry has fought those efforts tooth and nail. Trump has now put Section 230 in the line of fire. He has also exposed fault lines between the tech giants and how politically charged the issue of online expression has become just months before what is sure to be a bitterly fought election.</p><p>Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg went on conservative news channel Fox News to bash Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, saying: \"Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\" To wit, the president posted the exact same Twitter messages on Facebook. Facebook left them up.</p><p>It did the same after violent protests broke out over the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" Trump had tweeted. Twitter covered it with a warning about tweets that \"glorify violence\", next to a button that allowed readers to view the message. Zuckerberg left it up.</p><p>The Facebook chief explained: \"I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately, accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinised out in the open.\"</p><p>(Trump later sought to clarify the post, claiming it was a warning against violence rather than a promotion of it.)</p><p>Zuckerberg's position struck many as inconsistent. Just last month, the 36-year-old boasted of how Facebook had labelled 50 million posts \"misinformation\" about the coronavirus pandemic. Farid said: \"The hypocrisy of his statement . . . Two weeks ago, you're bragging about labelling misinformation, and the moment Trump pounces on Twitter, you're like, 'Oh yeah, we don't do that.' \"</p><p>A recent expos\u00e9 by The Wall Street Journal revealed how Facebook's own research made it clear that its algorithms were increasing social division, but that Zuckerberg chose to water down efforts to improve the quality of discourse because it might hurt growth.</p><p>As for the order itself, legal scholars reckon it has little chance of surviving the courts. The order empowers the Federal Communications Commission to assess whether editorial decisions are made in \"good faith\" or to \"stifle viewpoints with which they disagree\". The definition of good faith is vague, but if the FCC does determine that a tech company has acted unfairly, it can, in effect, remove the immunity provided by Section 230 - not just for the post in question, but for all content. This, potentially, could expose the companies to lawsuits.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-governmental organisation and ardent defender of Section 230, dubbed Trump's move an \"error-filled reading\" of the law that was, in fact, \"a transparent attempt to retaliate against Twitter for its decision to curate (well, really just to fact-check) his posts\".</p><p>With or without Trump's intervention, the chipping away at Section 230 has already begun. It is a rare issue where Democrats and Republicans have found a common cause. Farid labelled the law the \"ultimate gift\" because it provides a level of protection that no other industry enjoys.</p><p>A pharmaceuticals company that sells poisonous pills can be successfully sued; social media companies may help foment terrorism or promote fake medicine, but they are virtually impervious - as shown by a growing number of successful defences in court.</p><p>The first real dent in Section 230 came in 2018, when Congress passed an act to hold platforms liable for hosting posts used for child sex trafficking. Internet purists warned it would bring about the end of the web as we know it. It was a slippery slope that would kill free speech, they argued. Two years on, the web still exists - and Big Tech is bigger than ever.</p><p>Reformers are concerned, though, that Trump's act of political theatre may undermine efforts that have been building in the background. Farid said: \"It's the worst possible timing. The Department of Justice was literally days away from releasing suggestions on reforming 230.\"</p><p>The EARN IT Act, which would peel back Section 230 protections related to child sexual abuse, has been gaining momentum in the US Senate.</p><p>Farid added: \"This in many ways derails those very thoughtful conversations because it introduces this highly partisan component - and that is never going to end well for anybody.\"</p><p>On Friday, Trump took to Twitter again. He wrote: \"REVOKE 230!\"</p><p>                   Thank the Wolf of Wall Street                   </p><p>The internet as we know it today has taken shape thanks largely to one man: the Wolf of Wall Street.</p><p>Jordan Belfort, the fraudster depicted by Leonardo DiCaprio, below with co-star Margot Robbie, in Martin Scorsese's film, founded Stratton Oakmont. His brokerage sued Prodigy, an internet services provider, for defamation after an anonymous user on message boards accused Belfort of fraud. Stratton won. The court ruled that Prodigy was a publisher that exerted editorial control over content on its pages, and was thus liable. Two congressmen were concerned about the precedent it might set. Senator Ron Wyden and Christopher Cox wrote a statute to protect websites from liability for what users might post on their pages. It became Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, suddenly the hottest topic in US legal circles.</p><p>The law powered the rise of empires such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook, which traffic in user-generated content and have seen growth explode without having to worry about being legally accountable, as newspapers or radio stations are. Wyden, who remains in Congress, said last week that Donald Trump's executive order to potentially roll back Section 230 was \"plainly illegal\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-63287776</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601D-P381-F021-60FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1422\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 31, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump alleged that ballots would be stolen and forged on an epic scale. \"This will be a Rigged Election,\" he added. There was little evidence to back up his claims: Justin Levitt of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles analysed more than a billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014. He found 31 incidents of identity fraud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter - which for years has allowed its most famous user to rant, rave, bully and bluster uninterrupted - decided, finally, to wade in. The $24bn ((EURO)21bn) company slapped \"fact-check\" links under his tweets. The president and his allies swiftly labelled the move \"censorship\" - even though it was, in truth, a baby step. His tweets were not removed or edited. Instead, the president's favoured digital bullhorn appended a link in small print encouraging readers to \"get the facts\" about postal voting.</p><p>The following day, Trump signed an executive order telling regulators to strip legal immunity from companies found to have restricted certain voices on their platforms, specifically naming Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p><p>The move threatens to knee-cap the law upon which the modern web - and the empires that dominate it - are built. It sets the stage for an allout war that experts say may actually delay long-running efforts to hold the Silicon Valley giants to account. Tech trade groups are understood to have filed a federal lawsuit to strike down the order.</p><p>Hany Farid, a University of California computer science professor and a critic of the industry, said: \"There is a path forward to holding the sector more accountable for the harm [caused by] their services, while encouraging an open and free exchange of ideas. This executive order is not a productive part of that path.\"</p><p>The cornerstone of the web is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 1996. The law, passed when less than 10% of America or Britain had internet access, gives blanket immunity to platforms for content posted by users. As terrorism, child sexual abuse, misinformation, propaganda and conspiracies have spread across social media, calls for greater accountability have increasingly focused on either repealing Section 230 or carving it up to so that platforms can indeed be held liable for certain content.</p><p>The industry has fought those efforts tooth and nail. Trump has now put Section 230 in the firing line. He has also exposed faultlines between the tech giants and revealed how politically charged the issue of online expression has become just months before what is sure to be a bitterly fought election.</p><p>Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg went on conservative news channel Fox News to bash Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, saying: \"Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\" To wit, the president posted the exact same Twitter messages on Facebook. Facebook left them up. It did the same after violent protests broke out over the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man.</p><p>\"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" Trump had tweeted. Twitter covered it with a warning about tweets that \"glorify violence\", next to a button that allowed readers to view the message.</p><p>Zuckerberg left it up.</p><p>The Facebook chief explained: \"I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinised out in the open.\"</p><p>(Trump later sought to clarify the post, claiming it was a warning against violence rather than promotion of it.) Zuckerberg's position struck many as inconsistent. Just last month, the 36-yearold boasted of how Facebook had labelled 50 million posts \"misinformation\" about the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A recent expos\u00e9 by The Wall Street Journal revealed how Facebook's own research had made it clear that its algorithms were increasing social division, but that Zuckerberg chose to kill an effort to improve the quality of discourse because it might hurt growth. As for the order itself, legal scholars reckon it has little chance of surviving the courts. The order empowers the Federal Communications Commission to assess whether editorial decisions are made in \"good faith\" or to \"stifle viewpoints with which they disagree\".</p><p>The definition of good faith is vague. But if the FCC does determine that a tech company has acted unfairly, it can in effect remove the immunity provided by Section 230 - not just for the post in question, but for all content, potentially exposing companies to lawsuits. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nongovernmental organisation and ardent defender of Section 230, dubbed Trump's move an \"error-filled reading\" of the law that was, in fact, \"a transparent attempt to retaliate against Twitter for its decision to curate (well, really just to fact-check) his posts\".</p><p>This was echoed by the senator who wrote Section 230. \"I have warned for years that this administration was threatening 230 in order to chill speech and bully companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter into giving him favourable treatment,\" said Ron Wyden. \"Today, Trump proved me right.\"</p><p>With or without Trump's intervention, the chipping away at Section 230 has already begun. It is a rare issue where Democrats and Republicans have found common cause.</p><p>The first real dent in Section 230 came in 2018, when Congress passed an act to hold platforms liable for hosting posts used for child sex trafficking. Internet purists warned it would bring about the end of the web as we know it. It was a slippery slope that would kill free speech, they argued.</p><p>Two years on, the web still exists - and Big Tech is bigger than ever.</p><p>On Friday, Trump took to Twitter again. He wrote: \"REVOKE 230!\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-160377666</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601F-GX11-DYTY-C4BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1012\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 31, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The First Amendment, commentators on the right and the left pointed out, protects the freedom of speech, not the freedom from criticism. You have the right to speak, and others have the right to praise, mock, or ignore you as they see fit.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/important-first-amendment-principle-now-risk/610348/?utm_source=feed\">Garrett Epps: The important First Amendment principle now at risk</url>]<br/>As absurd as it may sound, Palin's bizarre interpretation of the First Amendment has now been adopted by the president of the United States. On Tuesday, the social-media company Twitter added a label to one of the president's tweets, which falsely declared that mail-in ballots would be \"substantially fraudulent,\" urging users to \"get the facts about mail-in voting.\" Twitter did not ban Trump from the platform, or censor his tweet, although it would have been fully within its rights to do so, and in accordance with its own terms of service. It merely appended additional context showing that the president's claim was false.<br/>In retaliation, Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/27/trump-twitter-label/\">signed an executive order</url> yesterday afternoon directing the federal government to \"reconsider the scope\" of Section 230, a provision of federal law that shields companies from liability for content posted by their users. The First Amendment was explicitly written to protect the right of citizens to express opposition to their leaders; it says that Congress \"shall make no law  abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" But to the president, criticism of his falsehoods is a violation of his free-speech rights. This position reverses the purpose of the First Amendment, turning an individual right of freedom of expression into the right of the state to silence its critics.<br/>Internet-communications companies have a tremendous amount of power to shape public discourse, power <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cjr.org/special_report/facebook-media-buzzfeed.php\">they have often wielded irresponsibly</url>. There are substantive debates to be had over the scope of that power, and whether state action is necessary to prevent monopolies or more strongly regulate the use of private data. But the president's actions are little more than an attempt to use state authority to intimidate social media companies into amplifying his falsehoods.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/it-takes-a-nation-of-snowflakes/541050/?utm_source=feed\">Most free-speech debates</url> over the past few years have involved not government censorship, but arguments over what forms of expression or behavior deserve social sanction or opprobrium, and over the line between proportionate outrage and cruelty. But Trump's attempt to punish Twitter for labeling his tweet is a textbook free-speech issue, one that involves the core democratic right to criticize the government. The responses from the pro-Trump right, after years of hand-wringing about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/it-takes-a-nation-of-snowflakes/541050/?utm_source=feed\">campus protests and mean tweets</url>, are telling.<br/>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-plays-into-trumps-hands-11590621733\">Wall Street Journal</url> took the opportunity to scold Twitter for \"handing Mr. Trump evidence to prove his point that technology elites are out to get the President and his followers,\" arguing that any forthcoming government censorship would be its fault because it angered the president. Writing in <url normalizedValue=\"https://nypost.com/2020/05/27/twitter-targets-conservatives-with-none-of-a-publishers-responsibilities/\">the</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://nypost.com/2020/05/27/twitter-targets-conservatives-with-none-of-a-publishers-responsibilities/\">New York Post</url>, Sohrab Ahmari cheered Trump on, announcing, \"If Twitter is going to ~fact check' the leader of the Free World,\" then \"it should be treated as the publisher that it is-with all the liabilities that entails.\" Aside from Ahmari's bizarre misunderstanding of the law-Twitter and other platforms are protected from liability from what its users post, not what the company itself posts-not needing permission from the state to criticize it is part of what makes a society free. The \"free world\" envisioned here is one in which Americans are free to say all the nice things they want about the handsome and smart Mr. Trump.  <br/>This should be obvious, but if your freedom to speak depends on the president approving of what you say, then you simply don't have freedom of speech. The Trumpist defense of state censorship of social media is that if you do not want your kneecaps broken, then you should make sure you pay the protection money. Twitter is hardly the first media company to face this kind of extortion from the president; as my colleague <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/trump-social-media-scarborough/612193/?utm_source=feed\">David Graham points out</url>, Trump has attempted to use the authority of his office to silence criticism from the Washington Post, CNN, members of the White House press corps, and even ESPN.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/donald-trumps-unprecedented-assault-on-the-media/567826/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Donald Trump's unprecedented assault on the media</url>]<br/>Although the actual legal effect of the order remains unclear, its intent is not. Democracy is impossible if private citizens cannot publicly oppose their leaders. The ultimate goal of Trump's retaliation is to chill criticism of his actions and behavior, by sanctioning online platforms that engage in such criticism. Contrary to the president's claim, Twitter was not \"stifling free speech\" by criticizing the head of state. But in directing the federal government to punish Twitter  and other social-media companies, Trump was engaging in a form of censorship.<br/>Social-media companies have First Amendment rights. They are allowed to define their own terms of service, and to decide who is in violation of them. Twitter is no more obligated to let you use its service than a restaurant owner is to serve you if you are not wearing shoes or a shirt. This has worked to Trump's benefit-although his posts frequently <url normalizedValue=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules\">violate the terms of service</url> of social-media platforms, his power and influence means that the companies are loath to remove him for his transgressions.<br/>Nor would removing the liability <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230\">protections of Section 230</url> necessarily lead to a fairer, less moderated internet. Although some conservatives, prodded by Republican lawmakers, have suggested that the law's protections are conditioned on platforms' remaining neutral toward political viewpoints, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17606974/oregon-senator-ron-wyden-interview-internet-section-230-net-neutrality\">no such provision exists in the text</url> of the law, and such a requirement would raise its own free speech issues.<br/>What Section 230 does do is keep companies from being sued when one of their users makes a defamatory claim, like falsely accusing someone of murder, as Trump himself has done repeatedly to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/business/media/trump-joe-scarborough-conservative-media.html\">conservative cable-news host Joe Scarborough</url> over the past few weeks. Trump, as president, enjoys some protections against defamation suits, but removing the protections of Section 230 would make online publishers more, not less, likely to moderate the things their users write, lest they be sued for a fraudulent or defamatory claim. Every restaurant review, comment section, or status update would become a liability risk for the company hosting them.<br/>There is a genuine debate to be had about the limits of Section 230. As Sarah Jeong <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/opinion/section-230-political-neutrality.html\">wrote in</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/opinion/section-230-political-neutrality.html\">The New York Times</url> last July, the liability shield prevents platforms from being sued for libelous claims made by users, but it has also been used to protect companies that refuse to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/opinion/section-230-political-neutrality.html\">take down revenge porn</url>. The presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Joe Biden, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html\">has argued that</url> Section 230 should be revoked to prevent platforms like Facebook from promoting false information. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the lawmaker who wrote Section 230, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18626779/ron-wyden-section-230-facebook-regulations-neutrality\">has defended the provision</url>, arguing that \"If you unravel 230, then you harm the opportunity for diverse voices, diverse platforms, and, particularly, the little guy to have a chance to get off the ground.\" Whether you think these arguments are good or bad, they are at least tied to what the law actually does. As Jeong wrote, \"there can be no honest debate over a version of C.D.A. 230 that doesn't exist.\"<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/twitter-cant-change-who-the-president-is/612133/?utm_source=feed\">Evelyn Douek: Trump is a problem that Twitter cannot fix</url>]<br/>Trump's goal, though, is not honest debate. It is censorship. If the tech companies do not promote his propaganda, or maintain his exemption from their own rules, they will be punished. His approach reflects a growing sense of victimization on the right over the shifting terms of public discourse, in which their views about politics, race, gender, and sexuality are now subject to harsh criticism from those who disagree with them. The growing diversity of the United States has so rapidly disrupted the grip on power that cultural conservatives once held-it was but a generation ago <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4279560\">that Democrats wanted to censor rap music</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.glaad.org/marriage/doma\">ban same-sex marriage</url>-that they are now turning to the power of the state to settle debates they are no longer confident of winning in the public square. Trumpists do not seek to curtail the power of Big Tech. They seek to wield it against their enemies.<br/>The leadership of the tech companies understands this. Facebook CEO <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/mark-zuckerberg-fact-check-twitter-facebook-0e3d9e92-00cd-4467-9ac8-bc50d4f8800e.html\">Mark Zuckerberg criticized</url>Twitter's actions yesterday morning, saying on Fox News that social-media companies should not be \"the arbiter of truth.\" But Facebook has been happy to make such decisions in Trump's favor, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/20/facebook-republican-shift/\">genuflecting toward power</url> while maintaining a facade of neutrality. In October, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/technology/biden-facebook-ad.html\">happily published an ad</url> from a pro-Trump political action committee that falsely accused Biden of corruption without fact-checking it; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-why-facebook-censored-an-anti-trump-ad/\">this month it labeled</url> a critical ad from the anti-Trump Lincoln Project \"partly false.\"<br/>The reach and influence of social media is novel, and there are no obvious rules that avoid curtailing someone's rights or concentrating too much power in the hands of one entity or another. But the public having to rely on the willingness of wealthy tech executives to resist political pressure from a president who wants to coerce them into doing his bidding is no solution.<br/>The Trumpist right, however, is not seeking solutions to difficult questions about rights and regulations. It is seeking to build social-media companies such as Twitter and Facebook into part of an authoritarian infrastructure that amplifies its power and silences its opposition. It is seeking to make real the president's conviction that he and his sycophants have the right to say whatever they want-and you have the right to be silent, the right to bend the knee, or the right to be punished. Or to say <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lou-dobbs-donald-trump-praise-coronavirus-100000_n_5ecf576ec5b6791a3c29f42b\">that Trump</url> \"is the greatest president in our history.\" Whichever you prefer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLANT-trumpswarpeddefinitionfreespeech612316</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLANT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6019-WBS1-DYY9-J01W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">368376</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

The First Amendment, commentators on the right and the left pointed out, protects the freedom of speech, not the freedom from criticism. You have the right to speak, and others have the right to praise, mock, or ignore you as they see fit.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/important-first-amendment-principle-now-risk/610348/?utm_source=feed\">Garrett Epps: The important First Amendment principle now at risk</url>]<br/>As absurd as it may sound, Palin's bizarre interpretation of the First Amendment has now been adopted by the president of the United States. On Tuesday, the social-media company Twitter added a label to one of the president's tweets, which falsely declared that mail-in ballots would be \"substantially fraudulent,\" urging users to \"get the facts about mail-in voting.\" Twitter did not ban Trump from the platform, or censor his tweet, although it would have been fully within its rights to do so, and in accordance with its own terms of service. It merely appended additional context showing that the president's claim was false.<br/>In retaliation, Trump       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/27/trump-twitter-label/\">signed an executive order</url> yesterday afternoon directing the federal government to \"reconsider the scope\" of Section 230, a provision of federal law that shields companies from liability for content posted by their users. The First Amendment was explicitly written to protect the right of citizens to express opposition to their leaders; it says that Congress \"shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" But to the president, criticism of his falsehoods is a violation of his free-speech rights. This position reverses the purpose of the First Amendment, turning an individual right of freedom of expression into the right of the state to silence its critics.<br/>Internet-communications companies have a tremendous amount of power to shape public discourse, power       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cjr.org/special_report/facebook-media-buzzfeed.php\">they have often wielded irresponsibly</url>. There are substantive debates to be had over the scope of that power, and whether state action is necessary to prevent monopolies or more strongly regulate the use of private data. But the president's actions are little more than an attempt to use state authority to intimidate social media companies into amplifying his falsehoods.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/it-takes-a-nation-of-snowflakes/541050/?utm_source=feed\">Most free-speech debates</url> over the past few years have involved not government censorship, but arguments over what forms of expression or behavior deserve social sanction or opprobrium, and over the line between proportionate outrage and cruelty. But Trump's attempt to punish Twitter for labeling his tweet is a textbook free-speech issue, one that involves the core democratic right to criticize the government. The responses from the pro-Trump right, after years of hand-wringing about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/it-takes-a-nation-of-snowflakes/541050/?utm_source=feed\">campus protests and mean tweets</url>, are telling.<br/>The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-plays-into-trumps-hands-11590621733\">Wall Street Journal</url> took the opportunity to scold Twitter for \"handing Mr. Trump evidence to prove his point that technology elites are out to get the President and his followers,\" arguing that any forthcoming government censorship would be its fault because it angered the president.

The \"free world\" envisioned here is one in which Americans are free to say all the nice things they want about the handsome and smart Mr. Trump.  <br/>This should be obvious, but if your freedom to speak depends on the president approving of what you say, then you simply don't have freedom of speech.

The presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Joe Biden,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html\">has argued that</url> Section 230 should be revoked to prevent platforms like Facebook from promoting false information. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the lawmaker who wrote Section 230,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18626779/ron-wyden-section-230-facebook-regulations-neutrality\">has defended the provision</url>, arguing that \"If you unravel 230, then you harm the opportunity for diverse voices, diverse platforms, and, particularly, the little guy to have a chance to get off the ground.\" Whether you think these arguments are good or bad, they are at least tied to what the law actually does. As Jeong wrote, \"there can be no honest debate over a version of C.D.A. 230 that doesn't exist.\"<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/twitter-cant-change-who-the-president-is/612133/?utm_source=feed\">Evelyn Douek: Trump is a problem that Twitter cannot fix</url>]<br/>Trump's goal, though, is not honest debate. It is censorship. If the tech companies do not promote his propaganda, or maintain his exemption from their own rules, they will be punished. His approach reflects a growing sense of victimization on the right over the shifting terms of public discourse, in which their views about politics, race, gender, and sexuality are now subject to harsh criticism from those who disagree with them. The growing diversity of the United States has so rapidly disrupted the grip on power that cultural conservatives once held-it was but a generation ago       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4279560\">that Democrats wanted to censor rap music</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.glaad.org/marriage/doma\">ban same-sex marriage</url>-that they are now turning to the power of the state to settle debates they are no longer confident of winning in the public square. Trumpists do not seek to curtail the power of Big Tech. They seek to wield it against their enemies.<br/>The leadership of the tech companies understands this. Facebook CEO       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/mark-zuckerberg-fact-check-twitter-facebook-0e3d9e92-00cd-4467-9ac8-bc50d4f8800e.html\">Mark Zuckerberg criticized</url>Twitter's actions yesterday morning, saying on Fox News that social-media companies should not be \"the arbiter of truth.\" But Facebook has been happy to make such decisions in Trump's favor,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/20/facebook-republican-shift/\">genuflecting toward power</url> while maintaining a facade of neutrality. In October, Facebook       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/technology/biden-facebook-ad.html\">happily published an ad</url> from a pro-Trump political action committee that falsely accused Biden of corruption without fact-checking it;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-why-facebook-censored-an-anti-trump-ad/\">this month it labeled</url> a critical ad from the anti-Trump Lincoln Project \"partly false.\"<br/>The reach and influence of social media is novel, and there are no obvious rules that avoid curtailing someone's rights or concentrating too much power in the hands of one entity or another. But the public having to rely on the willingness of wealthy tech executives to resist political pressure from a president who wants to coerce them into doing his bidding is no solution.<br/>The Trumpist right, however, is not seeking solutions to difficult questions about rights and regulations. It is seeking to build social-media companies such as Twitter and Facebook into part of an authoritarian infrastructure that amplifies its power and silences its opposition. It is seeking to make real the president's conviction that he and his sycophants have the right to say whatever they want-and you have the right to be silent, the right to bend the knee, or the right to be punished. Or to say       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lou-dobbs-donald-trump-praise-coronavirus-100000_n_5ecf576ec5b6791a3c29f42b\">that Trump</url> \"is the greatest president in our history.\" Whichever you prefer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-trumpswarpeddefinitionfreespeech612316</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6023-R7F1-JCG7-V023-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

It's a big change from the FCC's hands-off approach during the previous administration, when the \"gatekeeper\" tag was put on internet service providers - and not on the companies that use those connections to offer their own services, like Google, Facebook or Twitter, which were basically untouchable from a regulatory perspective.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While there is bipartisan support for finding a way to ensure there is some government oversight of the most transformative technology perhaps in human history - including support from cable broadband providers - the president's focus on online content he does not like threatens to add a layer of speech regulation that could dull the edge and even compromise its role as a marketplace of ideas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the order focuses on social media, law firm Wiley Rein says all the participants in online communication will be impacted by \"broad and long-term legal and policy effects.\"</p><p>For example, the president's directive to develop model legislation for states to enforce his speech policies could work against efforts, backed by ISPs, to create a uniform federal approach to online privacy and commerce.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"p72\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>Trump, in an executive order issued in May, directed the National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration to file a petition with the FCC, which it dutifully did late last month, to step into the regulation of web content. The FCC would be empowered to require Facebook and Google to publicly explain how they moderate their content, as well as the warnings they place on user posts like the ones Twitter placed on the president's tweets, which would be considered content generated by the platform and not subject to the Section 230 immunity from civil liability over third-party content, an immunity the president is targeting.</p><p>Trump has long said he was looking for a way to keep social media platforms from censoring conservative speech in general. More recently, he has been critical of what he sees as political censorship of his own posts by Twitter, posts that the White House has said are official presidential statements. So, it is clearly personal.</p><p>No less a Silicon Valley maven than Facebook chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has conceded there are legitimate concerns about liberal bias, but he does not think it is systemic and has said that is certainly not the case with his company.</p><p>FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said Trump's order attempts to enlist the agency in becoming what she calls the speech police, a business she doesn't want to be in.</p><p>The White House explained the move this way: \"In a country that has long valued freedom of expression, it is not acceptable for a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick speech that Americans may access and convey. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regulations Look Inevitable</emphasis></p><p>Some form of regulation of Big Tech appears inevitable. Last month's hearing in the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee with the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet (Google) was pretty much a proverbial case of \"the beatings shall commence.\" Democratic leaders said the big tech firms were too powerful, that the power had corrupted them and that they needed to be regulated and, in some cases, broken up.</p><p>Even though plenty of Democrats, including at last month's hearing, have criticized Section 230 - or have even called for its elimination - the president's linkage of the issue with his attacks on Twitter and other sites had some of those pausing to push back with one hand, even as they shake a big regulatory stick with the other.</p><p>Questions about whether or not websites still should enjoy blanket immunity from liability have been asked by everyone from conservative Republicans, who share Trump's suspicions about the suppression of conservative voices, to the Democratic author of the Communications Decency Act's Section 230 (see box). Section 230 is the law that says social-media platforms bear no civil liability for most of the speech posted on their sites and gives those platforms the freedom to remove content, or not, as they choose.</p><p>Immunity under Section 230 of the 1996 law is what allowed those sites to grow from the garage to the sprawling campus, but also, the law's critics say, allowed them to avoid the legal consequences of the hate speech, fake news, Russian election meddling and sex trafficking that finds its way onto their sites.</p><p>Social media sites argue, and with reason, that if they are liable for the millions or billions of posts they host, or for moderating them according to the perceived preferences of their community, it will be hard to sustain their business model.</p><p>But these social-media communities have become so large and powerful that what they allow or don't allow to be posted on their sites, or how they moderate those posts, can change the national conversation and impact many millions. Many in Washington have been saying that with that power comes responsibility - responsibility that Section 230 has allowed them to dodge, unlike news publishers that are subject to such civil liability.</p><p>While the president wants the FCC get involved with social-media content calls, that could be a big ask. As influential telcom law firm Wiley Rein pointed out in a note to clients about the executive order, the FCC recently rejected a petition to investigate broadcast coverage of the president, with the explanation that the regulator is not \"a roving arbiter of broadcasters' editorial judgments.\" The executive order essentially asks it to become an arbiter of edge provider content calls.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Bipartisan 'Techlash'</emphasis></p><p>There are no easy answers. But Democrats and Republicans have clearly been moving toward regulation, or at least heightened oversight and perhaps changes in the antitrust laws to capture the speed of tech innovation and consolidation, fueled by bipartisan concerns over issues like privacy and third-party marketing of user data. While Republicans criticize social media for allegedly censoring speech, Democrats argue the sites don't do enough to keep disinformation, including deceptive campaign ads, off their platforms.</p><p>One Big Tech critic speaking on background said social media platforms are clearly hoping that the executive order takes some of the pressure off. But he also said the \"techlash\" has its own momentum, likening it to a big rock rolling down a mountain with \"gravity on its side.\" Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the author of Section 230, said at a hearing last year that the whole point of the section was to have a \"shield and a sword,\" and the sword hasn't been used. But following the president's executive order, Wyden came to the defense of Section 230 and how it has been functioning.</p><p>\"Efforts to erode Section 230 will only make online content more likely to be false and dangerous,\" Wyden said. \"Section 230 does not prevent internet companies from moderating offensive or false content. And it does not change the First Amendment of the Constitution.\"</p><p>Other prominent Democrats have weighed in with questions about Section 230. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden apparently agrees with Trump that the section should go, telling <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The</emphasis> New York Times back in January that the section should be revoked, saying \"it is propagating falsehoods.\"</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has also called for an end to the \"sweetheart deal\" of Section 230. He had an unusual congressional ally in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who tried, unsuccessfully, to exclude Section 230 language from the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Mexico and Canada, calling the section a \"gift to big tech.\" She was joined in that effort to keep Section 230 from spreading by Reps. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Greg Walden (R-Ore.).</p><p>Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) are political poles apart. But they teamed up earlier this year on a bill that would amend Section 230 to say that the section's immunity for online platforms from civil liability for third-party content does not extend to child exploitation, meaning Facebook or Twitter could be held liable for posts that illegally exploit children. If that passes, it could open the door to other changes and the prospect of the death of Section 230 by a thousand cuts.</p><p>Blumenthal said Section 230 provides a unique, near-absolute immunity from legal consequences for \"certain companies and activities.\" The bill would remove that exemption from companies that did not earn it. (It is, appropriately, called the EARN IT Act.)</p><p>But the president's call for remaking Section 230 has forced pushback.</p><p>Pallone joined with other Democratic legislators to stand up for Big Tech. \"Online platforms should enforce their codes of conduct to combat disinformation, even when it is spread by right-wing extremists and the president himself, but the president has made clear he wants the internet to cower in fear,\" he said.</p><p>And following Trump's order, Blumenthal tweeted: \"Whatever the criticisms I may have of current law, this Executive Order is an authoritarian attack against freedom of expression and accountability. This Executive Order is egregiously excessive, with clearly malevolent intent to suppress free speech. It is a blatant attempt to use the full power of the United States government to force private companies to lie for the president.\"</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"p93\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>Critics ranging from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (top) on the left to Sen.

Rebecca, good morning.</p><p>REBECCA JARVIS (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Good morning, Amy. Yeah, this all started with a story by Axios, citing sources who say the President is obsessed with Amazon because his real estate buddies tell him Amazon is destroying shopping malls and brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p>REBECCA JARVIS (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) In just the last year, we saw more store closures in 2017 than any other year. Of course, you've seen Toys \"R\" Us going out of business. There's another possible factor here, though, because there's some history between the Amazon founder <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos, </nameText></person>who owns \"The Washington Post,\" and <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>\"The Washington Post\" has been critical of Trump and Trump has been critical of \"The Washington Post.\"</p><p>REBECCA JARVIS (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) And according to the report, Trump has wondered aloud now whether or not this company, Amazon, could be faced with antitrust or anti-competition law.</p><p>GRAPHICS: AMAZON STOCKS DIVE AFTER TRUMP REPORT</p><p>GRAPHICS: HAS THE TIDE TURNED AGAINST TECH GIANTS?</p><p>AMY ROBACH (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) And that was certainly enough to send the stocks plunging.

They're overhauling these privacy settings.

It also happens to be part of the digital chapter of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, where it was included to ensure that the protection it provides technology companies in the U.S. is applicable right across North America.</p><p>\"The extent to which the United States decided that it was going to create new levels of liability for these platforms, counter to or in conflict with what's found in Section 230 - that might run afoul of their new obligations under the USMCA,\" Geist said.</p><p>Dan Ujczo, a lawyer who specializes in Canada-U.S. trade, said while that's true on paper, the agreement is designed to be a \"living document\" that its myriad committees, interagency groups and enforcement bodies will be policing carefully during the early stages to ensure any conflicts or contradictions can be navigated.</p><p>And as always, it's an open question whether Trump will make good on his threat in the first place, he added.</p><p>\"These are warning shots and teeing up some kind of negotiation that will happen,\" Ujczo said. \"I don't see this as anything that will have a practical effect in the short term.\"</p><p>Steve DelBianco, president of NetChoice, a D.C.-based trade association that lobbies Congress on behalf of the technology industry, said while Trump's intent is to protect freedom of expression on the internet, he's going about it the wrong way.</p><p>\"It's the wrong vehicle in the right direction,\" DelBianco said.</p><p>\"Social media has been a godsend for average people, average Canadians, who want to share their news and views without a big traditional-media filter. For that reason, the limited liability that's in the USMCA makes sense for Canada, no matter what President Trump may do here in the United States to work over social-media platforms that he feels are not treating him fairly.\"</p><p>Trump seemed to have found a surprising ally of sorts: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>\"We have a different policy than Twitter on this,\" Zuckerberg told Fox News in an interview.</p><p>\"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. Private companies, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.\"</p><p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey used his own platform to push back against Zuckerberg.</p><p>\"We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally,\" Dorsey tweeted. \"Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 28, 2020.</p><p>- Follow James McCarten on Twitter @CdnPressStyle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-c04cdcfb5b864835a877c36ba106c23b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-S0S1-DY9S-T06S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><timeReceived>05:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
