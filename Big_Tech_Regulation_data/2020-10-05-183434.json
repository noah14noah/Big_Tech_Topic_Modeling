Battles between staff and companies are not new. In the mid to late 1800s and the turn of the twentieth century, labor unions became increasingly popular. </p><p>They were considered a way to collectively advocate for better pay and working conditions \u2014 often leading to disagreements with top executives and sometimes turning violent. But while many fought for maintaining the standards of their employment or improving their circumstances, workerscurrently in the tech industry are filing urgent appeals to their respective CEOs that demand the termination of a single, albeit consequential project \u2014 with some threatening to leave.Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Salesforce, a cloud computing company also on the Fortune 500 list, have all recently experienced internal unrest in which employees are unabashedly sharing their personal viewpoints and protesting leaderships' decisions. More than 650 Salesforce employees signed a petition contesting the company's involvement with Customs and Border Protection (CBP). They fault the federal agency for using Salesforce tools and services because they do not agree with CBP's recent efforts and the means it employs to stop illegal immigrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. 'Given the inhumane separation of children from their parents currently taking place at the border, we believe that our core value of Equality is at stake and that Salesforce should re-examine our contractual relationship with CBP and speak out against its practices,' reads the letter, which was addressed to CEO Marc Benioff,according[1]to BuzzFeed News. The employees admitted to a change in border enforcement but clarify the move is insufficient. 'We recognize the explicit policy of separating children at the border has been stopped, but that simply returns us to a status quo of detaining children with their parents at the border,' they write.The contentious immigration situation also sparked the ire of employees at Microsoft, who arefighting[2]with the company over its partnership with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 'We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm,'reads[3]the letter, which requests that 'Microsoft cancel its contracts with ICE.' Microsoft executives responded with amemo[4]from CEO Satya Nadella and a detailedblog post[5]from president Brad Smith. Both criticized the 'inhumane treatment of children at the U.S. border,' and Nadella promised that Microsoft is not working with the government on the practice of separating families. 'Our current cloud engagement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is supporting legacy mail, calendar, messaging and document management workloads,' Nadella wrote. None of the commentary deviates from previously espoused convictions. The leaders themselves have been consistently outspoken on key issues,especially related to immigration[6]\u2014at least[7]after the inauguration of President Donald Trump. But even if there is accordance between the deep-seated beliefs of those at the top and those at lower tiers of the company, it doesn't mean criticizing leadership is necessarily advisable to all. 'If an employee wants to use that power to pressure their employer to make business decisions based on the political predilections instead of business reasons that is certainly the employee's prerogative, but I wouldn't recommend it as a 'good career move,''Jennifer Grossman, CEO of the libertarian nonprofit The Atlas Society, and former senior vice president at Dole Food Company, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. 'Instead, I'd recommend young professionals focus on showing up early, staying late, and avoiding bringing distractions into the workplace. If they focus on advancing professionally, they will broaden their future range of options to either become politically active or donate to causes which inspire them.' Supported by some of the success unions and a collectively driven workforce have had in the past, Grossman, and Caleb Watney, a technology policy fellow at R Street, believe that workers often have leverage, but those in tech have considerable influence over the company that they comprise. 'Employees always have power because hiring an employee isn't like hiring a contractor. Arguably, employees have more power than ever before: tight labor market, litigious culture, regulations, costs to retrain new hires,' said Grossman, a presidential speechwriter in the White House during the George H.W. Bush administration. 'When compared to other parts of the economy, workers at big tech companies are much harder to replace given the scarcity of their skills, and as such, have much higher salaries on average,' Watney told TheDCNF. 'I think everyone instinctively wants to work for a company they believe is changing the world in a positive direction. It just so happens that tech workers have much more leverage and can shape that direction more actively than workers in other sectors.' As for working with entities or projects deemed unseemly by many or evil by some, Watney says the complexity of tech companies' business is a huge contributing factor. In other words, as the biggest in the industry expand into almost every sector of society \u2014 Amazon, for example, has stakes infilm and show production[8],cloud computing[9], distribution, andgrocery services[10]\u2014 so too does the ethical questions behind some of the initiatives. 'Which means the workers at those companies will have more opportunities to shape the decisions that are made on these high-impact questions,' said Watney. Employees and some in the public have criticized Amazon, along with Microsoft and Salesforce, after the American Civil Liberties Union obtaineddocuments and communications[11]showing Amazon offering a facial recognition tool to local law enforcement departments around the country. Workers sent a letter to CEO Jeff Bezos demanding Amazon stop selling the software to the government out of fear it will be used in an invasive way and called for ending a cloud service agreement with Peter Thiel's Palantir, whichworks[12]with ICE. But at the same time as passionate discussions occur, elsewhere companies are trying to suppress heated debate. Google established a new set of rules in June,according[13]to The Wall Street Journal, roughly a year after it firedengineerJames Damore[14]for internallypublishing a memo outlining his views on gender and advocating for freedom of expression within work. 'A healthy company should and will encourage internal discussion of controversial issues it is involved in, and during those internal discussions, both parties have obligations \u2014 the employees to continue to do their jobs according to their general agreement and the employers to consider seriously what their employees are saying,' Stephen Hicks, a professor of philosophy at Rockford University and senior scholar at The Atlas Society, told TheDCNF. But the amount of debate \u2014 'nonstop'according[15]to another, more in-depth WSJ report \u2014 is effecting change at Google. Google employees \u2014 despite rules that are more aimed at curtailing internal online discussion boards \u2014 were able to obtain a massive concession from their superiors.The tech giant decided to no longer work with the Pentagon on a drone surveillance technology project called Project Maven after some workersresigned[16]and others threatened to do so. Salesforce, on the other hand, isnot severing ties[17]with CBP, although Benioff says he is opposed to the family separation policy, and the company claims not to participate in that specific practice. Like SalesForce and seemingly unlike Google, the other aforementioned companies haven't yet reached a breaking point. As the tides of polarization seem to intensify, aggrieved employees may demand increasing changes from those they work for. The top officials of the players that make up the industry will have to decide how far they will allow that to continue, what is healthy, and what is unproductive. 'If there's a business decision that's going to provide substantial financial returns and yet also present significant risks, either in terms of a potentially distracting public relations crisis, or employee attrition, morale, and recruitment, then those alternatives need to be weighed carefully,' Grossman said. 'That's why companies pay handsomely for leadership that will make the right decision, chart the right course, because the wrong decision can mean financial ruin.'

Large multinational companies have jumped out to a headstart in the race to succeed, and Canada runs the risk of falling behind. At stake is nothing less than our prosperity and economic well-being. The Financial Post set out explore what is needed for businesses to flourish and grow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GEOFF ZOCHODNE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The federal government put the word out last July: it needed someone to study the landscape for financial technology companies, or fintechs, and figure out how they were getting along with the big banks and other financial institutions.</p><p>Sue Britton's firm, Toronto-based Fintech Growth Syndicate Inc., won the contract for the study. In January, the group said it turned in a 240-page report, the first of its kind in Canada, that used only publicly available data sourced from more than 60 different websites.</p><p>What it found, among other things, was that there were approximately 1,000 fintechs across Canada offering services or products related to crowdfunding, insurance, wealth management, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, capital markets, lending and payments.</p><p>The majority of those companies were startups, founded in the years following 2012, and employed less than 99 people each, though combined they had more than 30,000 people. Perhaps more eye-catching was the estimated of value of fintech startups in Canada: $30.5 billion.</p><p>What the study did not find, however, was 1,000 partnerships with financial institutions: Canada's Big Five banks may have been increasing their engagement with fintechs, but \"the majority of their efforts\" were still on building their own products and digital experiences. They were also busy trying to update their \"bowl of spaghetti\" technologies and systems, some of which may be decades old.</p><p>As a result, one of Canada's biggest industries is essentially innovating at a pretty tame pace, the country is lagging its peers in adopting new financial technologies and consumers of all types may be paying more for services than they should. The financial industry's existing business models could eventually come under pressure as well.</p><p>\"To the extent that we could find publicly available information, we were able to show that, yes, there are some fintechs that are partnering with financial institutions,\" Britton said. \"But certainly the majority of those partnerships are on the financial institutions' terms. They're not groundbreaking new business models ... It's not going to make the marketplace more competitive, because it's going to, in fact, if anything, grow the business for the incumbent.\"</p><p>Retaining the status quo may be all well and good for big banks and insurance companies for now. It may even be good for their customers - and most financial consumers have a connection to a big bank or insurer - who may be enjoying a smoother user experience or a new platform at their current institution of choice.</p><p>But legacy financial companies face a bit of a conflict of interest when it comes to innovation. After all, they have earnings targets to hit, shareholders to keep happy and thousands of employees and existing systems already in place to meet those goals. Why risk cannibalizing such profitable businesses or, moreover, give the vaunted stability of Canada's financial industry a jolt? Yet the incumbents could wake up one day to find their lunches being eaten by big-tech firms such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., which are already offering a payments solution, some more aggressively than others.</p><p>\"What our big banks aren't doing is moving as quickly as other parts of the world, innovating their business models, extending financial services to more small businesses or reducing their fees,\" Fintech Growth Syndicate said. \"Perhaps, as Abraham Lincoln famously said, 'give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe,'they are still sharpening the axe.\"</p><p>It's also possible that no one is even swinging an axe in the financial sector, despite the federal government's efforts to push the innovation envelope in various industries.</p><p>Competition Bureau research \"points to low levels of financial technology adoption in Canada relative to other countries, and limited consumer engagement driven, in part, by frictions associated with shopping around and switching,\" according to a document published in February by the interim commissioner of competition. \"These factors are symptoms of a market that is not functioning to its full potential.\"</p><p>Britton believes the major banks and insurers face the innovator's dilemma, first by outlined in a 1997 book by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen: An incumbent with a big base of existing customers and shareholders demanding good returns is unlikely to welcome a company that could disrupt its own business.</p><p>On the other hand, \"You don't want to wake up one day and be Blockbuster,\" she said.</p><p>Nobody, of course, wants to be compared to a bankrupt video-store chain, which is why the financial sector is certainly aware that the big-tech companies are making inroads into their business.</p><p>Royal Bank of Canada chief executive Dave McKay reportedly noted in mid-March that he was increasingly concerned with the prospect of Facebook Inc., Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google (the FANG companies) getting into banking.</p><p>\"They are getting between us and the moments of truth of our customers, and currently what they do with that is they sell that insight back to us in the form of search and advertising and other perspectives, and they earn a certain amount of economic rent,\" he said, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>RBC and the other big financial institutions know they need to up their game, something that was noted by Luge Capital, a Canadian venture fund focused on fintech and artificial intelligence, when it did its own scan of the fintech landscape for a report published last October.</p><p>Luge Capital, which has been backed by institutions such as the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and Sun Life Financial Inc., found the climate for possible partnerships between startups and big banks or insurers had improved.</p><p>\"Large incumbents have customers, well-established brands and vaults of financial resources,\" the report said. \"As a venture capital fund with large financial institutions backers, such as Sunlife, Desjardins, CDPQ and La Capital and Le Fonds FTQ, we see first-hand their desire to partner with early stage innovators.\"</p><p>The biggest banks may still have the \"vast majority\" of the market share in financial services, but there has been a shift recently, said Karim Gillani, general partner at Luge Capital.</p><p>\"In the last three to five years, there's been a widespread recognition amongst the FIs (financial institutions) that they need to work with the early stage or smaller fintech companies in order to enhance their service offering for their customers,\" he said.</p><p>Gillani said there was value in financial institutions exploring new ways of \"offering functionality,\" such as robo-advisers as a form of wealth management, something several banks have already done.</p><p>\"It's a demonstration of how banks are shifting their view from the traditional wealth-management experience to something that's more automated and driven by technology so that it becomes appealing to a different segment of the population,\" he said.</p><p>The federal government might open another door for the fintechs to get to the market. Ottawa is currently considering the idea of open banking, which is supposed to give people more control of their data and make it more portable.</p><p>The competition commissioner, in a submission made in response to a government consultation paper that outlined the benefits and concerns of open banking, said the framework could allow consumers to shop around and compare prices, potentially stirring up competition by lowering search costs.</p><p>\"Banks would be forced to compete harder for consumers, and consumers would have access to a broader range of services, if the benefits of technology could be more fully exploited through open banking,\" the submission stated.</p><p>Yet bringing third parties into Canada's financial system - renowned for its stability - has raised some concern for at least one federal regulator, who pointed out that such decentralization \"magnifies non-financial risks and diffuses accountability.\"</p><p>Ben Gully, assistant superintendent at the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, raised the issue in a little-noticed speech in February, noting that new tools will be required to manage these concerns.</p><p>\"Technology will enable or accelerate further decentralization of financial market participants and blur the boundaries of a traditional regulated financial institution,\" he said, according to a copy of his remarks.</p><p>In other words, increasing the number of touch points increases the number of potential vulnerable spots and the likelihood that the buck no longer stops with a bank, which is where regulators are used to seeing it stop.</p><p>Instead of worrying that banks carry enough capital, watchdogs now to have worry about the type of cloud storage or anti-virus software that lenders use, but do not entirely control.</p><p>\"We have seen the link between non-financial risks and their impact on reputation, such as the public and stakeholder responses to third-party privacy breaches,\" Gully said. \"These can quickly affect an institution's operations, its ability to grow its business and, potentially, its bottom line.\"</p><p>But it's hard to see the financial industry shunning technology completely. The uses for paper bankbooks and even brick-and-mortar branches are becoming fewer and farther between as customer preferences shift toward mobile and online banking and other financial services.</p><p>There are also strong signs that other sectors are chomping at the bit for the financial industry to adopt more innovations.</p><p>For example, Wayne Pommen was in Las Vegas earlier in March looking over hundreds of tables and chairs and signs, all lined up to match retailers with the tech companies vying to serve them. It was a scene not dissimilar to a speed-dating event.</p><p>\"I'm in a sea of logos,\" Pommen, chief executive of Toronto-based fintech Pay-Bright, told Financial Post in a phone interview during a break in the action.</p><p>PayBright is a consumer lender, paying retailers the next business day while allowing customers to pay off their purchases in instalments, and the retail conference was the perfect place to announce some news: Pommen revealed a partnership with Swedish fintech unicorn Klarna Bank AB, which could allow thousands of merchants worldwide to offer the PayBright option to Canadian customers.</p><p>The money for PayBright's payments comes from the same place as it does for a lot of folks: banks. The company has received funding from Canadian Western Bank, as well as the Canadian Business Growth Fund, which is backed by the Big Six banks, as well as major insurers.</p><p>Pommen said the big banks may have massive consumer bases and lower costs of capital, but the fintechs can offer faster ways to deploy technology and develop better user experiences.</p><p>\"Most banks and fintechs have realized there's huge benefits to partnership,\" he said.</p><p>A report released on Monday by Toronto Finance International, a tie-up between government, the financial-services sector and academia, found growing collaboration between financial institutions and fintechs, but \"key challenges\" on both ends of these partnerships.</p><p>\"In our discussions with executives of Canadian financial institutions, one problem outlined was difficulty in finding the right fintech offering enterprise-ready products or services meeting the scalability and security requirements of FI's systems,\" the report said. \"Also, with a relatively lower technology adoption rate as compared to other global fintech hubs, Canadian businesses tend to look for proven solutions when partnering with fintechs.\"</p><p>The Toronto Finance International report - which noted financial institutions can provide fintechs with mentorship and guidance in addition to financing - also found that Canadian fintech hubs were trailing when it came to embracing disruptive technology.</p><p>But Canadian consumers, most of whom bank with at least one of the Big Six, may have no idea such alternatives exist.</p><p>\"Some think that consumers don't want fintech solutions because adoption in Canada is lower than other regions, and that there isn't a need to aggressively enable a more competitive financial services market,\" FGS said. \"But maybe it's not because Canadians don't want fintech products - it's that they don't know that opportunity is out there.\"</p><p>The number of those products is also increasing, with or without partnership, but may be losing some steam.</p><p>At the time of Fintech Growth Syndicate's study, only parts of which were shared with Financial Post, there were 995 fintech companies in Canada. That has since increased to more than 1,050, it said, although the rate of new companies being created has been in decline in recent years. The TFI report found that the number of fintech startups founded in the Toronto region dropped to nine last year from 33 in 2014.</p><p>To help make some of those companies successful, Britton suggested governments look at their own structures. For example, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority acts as the financial-services watchdog and has a mandate to promote competition. OSFI, as one example, does not have such a mandate.</p><p>It will take time for Canada to begin adopting tech like other countries, Britton said. But it will happen.</p><p>\"It's not a blip, it's not a bubble, it's not a one-off,\" she said. \"It is the future.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Large multinational companies have jumped out to a headstart in the race to succeed, and Canada runs the risk of falling behind. At stake is nothing less than our prosperity and economic well-being. The Financial Post set out explore what is needed for businesses to flourish and grow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The federal government put the word out last July: it needed someone to study the landscape for financial technology companies, or fintechs, and figure out how they were getting along with the big banks and other financial institutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sue Britton's firm, Toronto-based Fintech Growth Syndicate Inc., won the contract for the study. In January, the group said it turned in a 240-page report, the first of its kind in Canada, that used only publicly available data sourced from more than 60 different websites.</p><p>What it found, among other things, was that there were approximately 1,000 fintechs across Canada offering services or products related to crowdfunding, insurance, wealth management, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, capital markets, lending and payments.</p><p>The majority of those companies were startups, founded in the years following 2012, and employed less than 99 people each, though combined they had more than 30,000 people. Perhaps more eye-catching was the estimated of value of fintech startups in Canada: $30.5 billion.</p><p>What the study did not find, however, was 1,000 partnerships with financial institutions: Canada's Big Five banks may have been increasing their engagement with fintechs, but \"the majority of their efforts\" were still on building their own products and digital experiences. They were also busy trying to update their \"bowl of spaghetti\" technologies and systems, some of which may be decades old.</p><p>As a result, one of Canada's biggest industries is essentially innovating at a pretty tame pace, the country is lagging its peers in adopting new financial technologies and consumers of all types may be paying more for services than they should. The financial industry's existing business models could eventually come under pressure as well.</p><p>\"To the extent that we could find publicly available information, we were able to show that, yes, there are some fintechs that are partnering with financial institutions,\" Britton said. \"But certainly the majority of those partnerships are on the financial institutions' terms. They're not groundbreaking new business models ... It's not going to make the marketplace more competitive, because it's going to, in fact, if anything, grow the business for the incumbent.\"</p><p>Retaining the status quo may be all well and good for big banks and insurance companies for now. It may even be good for their customers - and most financial consumers have a connection to a big bank or insurer - who may be enjoying a smoother user experience or a new platform at their current institution of choice.</p><p>But legacy financial companies face a bit of a conflict of interest when it comes to innovation. After all, they have earnings targets to hit, shareholders to keep happy and thousands of employees and existing systems already in place to meet those goals. Why risk cannibalizing such profitable businesses or, moreover, give the vaunted stability of Canada's financial industry a jolt? Yet the incumbents could wake up one day to find their lunches being eaten by big-tech firms such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., which are already offering a payments solution, some more aggressively than others.</p><p>\"What our big banks aren't doing is moving as quickly as other parts of the world, innovating their business models, extending financial services to more small businesses or reducing their fees,\" Fintech Growth Syndicate said. \"Perhaps, as Abraham Lincoln famously said, 'give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe,'they are still sharpening the axe.\"</p><p>It's also possible that no one is even swinging an axe in the financial sector, despite the federal government's efforts to push the innovation envelope in various industries.</p><p>Competition Bureau research \"points to low levels of financial technology adoption in Canada relative to other countries, and limited consumer engagement driven, in part, by frictions associated with shopping around and switching,\" according to a document published in February by the interim commissioner of competition. \"These factors are symptoms of a market that is not functioning to its full potential.\"</p><p>Britton believes the major banks and insurers face the innovator's dilemma, first by outlined in a 1997 book by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen: An incumbent with a big base of existing customers and shareholders demanding good returns is unlikely to welcome a company that could disrupt its own business.</p><p>On the other hand, \"You don't want to wake up one day and be Blockbuster,\" she said.</p><p>Nobody, of course, wants to be compared to a bankrupt video-store chain, which is why the financial sector is certainly aware that the big-tech companies are making inroads into their business.</p><p>Royal Bank of Canada chief executive Dave McKay reportedly noted in mid-March that he was increasingly concerned with the prospect of Facebook Inc., Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google (the FANG companies) getting into banking.</p><p>\"They are getting between us and the moments of truth of our customers, and currently what they do with that is they sell that insight back to us in the form of search and advertising and other perspectives, and they earn a certain amount of economic rent,\" he said, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>RBC and the other big financial institutions know they need to up their game, something that was noted by Luge Capital, a Canadian venture fund focused on fintech and artificial intelligence, when it did its own scan of the fintech landscape for a report published last October.</p><p>Luge Capital, which has been backed by institutions such as the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and Sun Life Financial Inc., found the climate for possible partnerships between startups and big banks or insurers had improved.</p><p>\"Large incumbents have customers, well-established brands and vaults of financial resources,\" the report said. \"As a venture capital fund with large financial institutions backers, such as Sunlife, Desjardins, CDPQ and La Capital and Le Fonds FTQ, we see first-hand their desire to partner with early stage innovators.\"</p><p>The biggest banks may still have the \"vast majority\" of the market share in financial services, but there has been a shift recently, said Karim Gillani, general partner at Luge Capital.</p><p>\"In the last three to five years, there's been a widespread recognition amongst the FIs (financial institutions) that they need to work with the early stage or smaller fintech companies in order to enhance their service offering for their customers,\" he said.</p><p>Gillani said there was value in financial institutions exploring new ways of \"offering functionality,\" such as robo-advisers as a form of wealth management, something several banks have already done.</p><p>\"It's a demonstration of how banks are shifting their view from the traditional wealth-management experience to something that's more automated and driven by technology so that it becomes appealing to a different segment of the population,\" he said.</p><p>The federal government might open another door for the fintechs to get to the market. Ottawa is currently considering the idea of open banking, which is supposed to give people more control of their data and make it more portable.</p><p>The competition commissioner, in a submission made in response to a government consultation paper that outlined the benefits and concerns of open banking, said the framework could allow consumers to shop around and compare prices, potentially stirring up competition by lowering search costs.</p><p>\"Banks would be forced to compete harder for consumers, and consumers would have access to a broader range of services, if the benefits of technology could be more fully exploited through open banking,\" the submission stated.</p><p>Yet bringing third parties into Canada's financial system - renowned for its stability - has raised some concern for at least one federal regulator, who pointed out that such decentralization \"magnifies non-financial risks and diffuses accountability.\"</p><p>Ben Gully, assistant superintendent at the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, raised the issue in a little-noticed speech in February, noting that new tools will be required to manage these concerns.</p><p>\"Technology will enable or accelerate further decentralization of financial market participants and blur the boundaries of a traditional regulated financial institution,\" he said, according to a copy of his remarks.</p><p>In other words, increasing the number of touch points increases the number of potential vulnerable spots and the likelihood that the buck no longer stops with a bank, which is where regulators are used to seeing it stop.</p><p>Instead of worrying that banks carry enough capital, watchdogs now to have worry about the type of cloud storage or anti-virus software that lenders use, but do not entirely control.</p><p>\"We have seen the link between non-financial risks and their impact on reputation, such as the public and stakeholder responses to third-party privacy breaches,\" Gully said. \"These can quickly affect an institution's operations, its ability to grow its business and, potentially, its bottom line.\"</p><p>But it's hard to see the financial industry shunning technology completely. The uses for paper bankbooks and even brick-and-mortar branches are becoming fewer and farther between as customer preferences shift toward mobile and online banking and other financial services.</p><p>There are also strong signs that other sectors are chomping at the bit for the financial industry to adopt more innovations.</p><p>For example, Wayne Pommen was in Las Vegas earlier in March looking over hundreds of tables and chairs and signs, all lined up to match retailers with the tech companies vying to serve them. It was a scene not dissimilar to a speed-dating event.</p><p>\"I'm in a sea of logos,\" Pommen, chief executive of Toronto-based fintech Pay-Bright, told Financial Post in a phone interview during a break in the action.</p><p>PayBright is a consumer lender, paying retailers the next business day while allowing customers to pay off their purchases in instalments, and the retail conference was the perfect place to announce some news: Pommen revealed a partnership with Swedish fintech unicorn Klarna Bank AB, which could allow thousands of merchants worldwide to offer the PayBright option to Canadian customers.</p><p>The money for PayBright's payments comes from the same place as it does for a lot of folks: banks. The company has received funding from Canadian Western Bank, as well as the Canadian Business Growth Fund, which is backed by the Big Six banks, as well as major insurers.</p><p>Pommen said the big banks may have massive consumer bases and lower costs of capital, but the fintechs can offer faster ways to deploy technology and develop better user experiences.</p><p>\"Most banks and fintechs have realized there's huge benefits to partnership,\" he said.</p><p>A report released on Monday by Toronto Finance International, a tie-up between government, the financial-services sector and academia, found growing collaboration between financial institutions and fintechs, but \"key challenges\" on both ends of these partnerships.</p><p>\"In our discussions with executives of Canadian financial institutions, one problem outlined was difficulty in finding the right fintech offering enterprise-ready products or services meeting the scalability and security requirements of FI's systems,\" the report said. \"Also, with a relatively lower technology adoption rate as compared to other global fintech hubs, Canadian businesses tend to look for proven solutions when partnering with fintechs.\"</p><p>The Toronto Finance International report - which noted financial institutions can provide fintechs with mentorship and guidance in addition to financing - also found that Canadian fintech hubs were trailing when it came to embracing disruptive technology.</p><p>But Canadian consumers, most of whom bank with at least one of the Big Six, may have no idea such alternatives exist.</p><p>\"Some think that consumers don't want fintech solutions because adoption in Canada is lower than other regions, and that there isn't a need to aggressively enable a more competitive financial services market,\" FGS said. \"But maybe it's not because Canadians don't want fintech products - it's that they don't know that opportunity is out there.\"</p><p>The number of those products is also increasing, with or without partnership, but may be losing some steam.</p><p>At the time of Fintech Growth Syndicate's study, only parts of which were shared with Financial Post, there were 995 fintech companies in Canada.

OSFI, as one example, does not have such a mandate.</p><p>It will take time for Canada to begin adopting tech like other countries, Britton said.

The President writing, \"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to censor in advance of the 2020 election.

The President earlier threatening to strongly regulate or close them down, despite the fact the President has no authority to shut down a private company. President Trump with his eighty million followers on Twitter set to sign an executive order today that details not yet public. But The Washington Post reports it could open the door for federal officials to try to penalize Facebook, Google and Twitter for the way they moderate content on their sites, according to two people familiar with the matter. The White House not commenting. In an interview with Fox News Facebook`s CEO Mark Zuckerberg was asked if Twitter made the wrong decision, fact checking the President.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG (The Daily Briefing; Fox News) (07:12:44): We have a different policy, I-- I think, than Twitter on this. You know, I-- I just believe strongly that-- that Facebook shouldn`t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.

The often-intense debates about these policies aren't just important because they could reshape the U.S. economy. They also reflect a larger, more fundamental disagreement about capitalism itself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., believe that the American system of extractive capitalism is fundamentally broken - Sanders to the point of identifying as a democratic socialist - and see its failure as one of the forces that carried President Donald Trump to the White House. Former vice president Joe Biden voices an opposing view: At an October fundraiser in Silicon Valley, he characterized Trump not as a product of American capitalism but rather a threat to it. \"You don't need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this - you've just got to make capitalism work like it's supposed to work,\" he said. \"We've got to save capitalism from this guy.\"</p><p> Last week, as part of the Munk Debates series in Toronto, I had the opportunity to debate capitalism and the potential alternatives to it alongside Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis, former American Enterprise Institute president (and current Post contributor) Arthur C. Brooks and New York Times columnist David Brooks. I argued that the American system is broken in three ways.</p><p> First, it is fueling extreme inequality. Four decades of stagnant wages and upward flows of wealth in the United States have supercharged the existing wealth divide and other inequalities rooted in racial, gender and geographic differences. Productivity gains have flowed to the investor class, not to workers, and social mobility has declined. In his latest column (prepared for the debate), David Brooks countered that \"capitalism has brought about the greatest reduction of poverty in human history.\" But Oxfam International highlights a more nuanced reality: While there has been a meaningful decline in extreme poverty, hundreds of millions more people could have been lifted out of poverty if not for extreme inequalities within and across countries.</p><p> Second, capitalism is undermining democracy. In the Citizens United era, the amount of money in politics has exploded, resulting in elected officials from both parties who are more beholden to wealthy donors - and their business interests - than ever before. Corporate concentration is reducing competition and rendering both workers and consumers increasingly powerless against rising plutocracy. And this is happening as the forces of private equity and big tech conspire to annihilate the local and independent journalism that is vital to maintaining a democratic society.</p><p> It doesn't take a socialist to see capitalism's corrosive impact on democracy. In fact, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a former McKinsey consultant who was forced on Monday to finally agree to disclose his campaign bundlers,used to recognize it earlier in the campaign, saying, \"There's tension between capitalism and democracy, and negotiating that tension is probably the biggest challenge for America right now.\"</p><p> And, third, capitalism is destroying nature. As corporate lobbyists work to dismantle the regulatory apparatus, the companies they represent are irrevocably harming our environment, our health and our collective future. In pursuit of profits at any cost, corporations continue to ravage public lands, demolishing ecosystems, and poisoning the water we drink and the air we breathe. Meanwhile, even as corporate America has become more vocal about the importance of sustainability and the perils of climate change, it has opposed the dramatic policy changes needed to prevent catastrophe.</p><p> American politics is finally having a long-overdue debate about how to respond to these trends. Many of the ideas being discussed in the presidential race are undoubtedly part of the solution. But tweaking around the economy's edges won't be enough. We need a deep, structural redesign of basic institutions and functions; we need a new system to better serve the common good.</p><p> In this system, there will continue to be individual freedoms, private enterprises and small businesses. But, unlike today, those businesses will be protected from monopoly power. There will be new models of corporate ownership and governance that protect workers' rights and increase their power. There will be limits on excessive consumption. And there will be a \"plutocracy prevention\" program - not to be punitive, but to ensure that billionaires pay more in taxes than teachers and nurses, and that we have the revenue needed to rebuild decaying infrastructure, combat climate change, reverse declining social mobility and more.</p><p> Brooks writes that one of capitalism's strengths is \"creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out.\" On that we agree. But I've learned over four decades of observing and writing about the economy that capitalism as we've known it doesn't work. Time is of the essence. For the sake of our economic, democratic and ecological survival, it's time for something better.</p><p>           Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor and publisher of the Nation magazine, writes a weekly column for The Washington Post.     </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-4845396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897DB50F347E1 NWBKMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRV-H031-DXVP-V1D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Milford Daily News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The company's president, Steve Davis, has a fittingly whimsical background, laid out in a new profile from Bloomberg[2]. Davis taught himself how to make frozen yogurt while earning his Ph.D. and opened his own yogurt shop, which he later sold for $1. He also used to own a Washington bar called Thomas Foolery that accepted Bitcoin[3] payments. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[4] Elon Musk's Boring Company has built a reputation for offbeat stunts \u2014 while its primary business is focused on digging a network of tunnels for Tesla cars under major US cities, the company has drawn attention for selling flamethrowers[5] and building a Monty Python-style watchtower[6]. As it turns out, Boring Company president Steve Davis has a history of wacky gimmicks throughout his career, detailed in a new profile[7] from Bloomberg reporter Sarah McBride (the profile builds on reporting from Ashlee Vance's book on Elon Musk[8]). Davis was hand-picked by Musk to lead Boring Company, perhaps in part because of his colorful background. Before working for Musk, Davis founded a frozen yogurt shop and a bar that accepts bitcoin, among other ventures. </p><p>Boring Company now faces scrutiny, especially in Chicago and Las Vegas, where it plans to build its first tunnels. It still hasn't constructed any commercial tunnels, though the Las Vegas project is under construction. The company is now weathering pushback from skeptical lawmakers[9] \u2014 Davis will have to navigate those concerns in order for the company to follow through on its vision. Here are some of the most striking details from Davis' life before Boring Company. Musk tested Davis' engineering skills by challenging him to make a $120,000 part with a budget of $5,000. After months of work, Davis emailed Musk that he did so with just $3,900 and Musk responded with one word: \"Ok.\" The Boring CompanyThe anecdote was reported in Ashlee Vance's book, Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future[10].Davis was living in D.C. working for SpaceX and missed California-style Frozen Yogurt, so he taught himself to make it \"via trial and error\" and opened his own yogurt shop, \"Mr. Yogato.\" Mark Lenihan/APSource: Bloomberg[11]Mr. Yogato offered discounts to customers who could answer trivia questions, or ask \"Seinfeld\" trivia questions that Davis couldn't answer. Customers also got a discount for dressing as tennis player Bjorn Borg. APThe \"Rules of Yogato\" are detailed on Mr. Yogato's website[12].See the rest of the story at Business Insider[13] See Also: EA just delivered the best 'Star Wars' game in a decade, and it's a clear

Smith was working at Microsoft back in the '90s, when Microsoft was sued by the federal government over its business practices, and put under a decade of government oversight. Smith said that after the Trump administration's travel ban some 23 months ago, the tech industry came together for a meeting. </p><p>Since then, he's had ongoing meetings with top senior execs in the industry to \"share notes\" on the big issues.  Microsoft's top lawyer says that he regularly meets with the most senior executives at the biggest tech companies to discuss how the industry is being targeted by regulators, and what to do about it. So said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, on Monday to a room full of journalists in Seattle as part of an invite-only day for the media. Without naming names, he talked about these meetings. He said that these meetings began around the \"immigration issue\" of 23 months ago \u2014 specifically, President Donald Trump's executive order banning travel from several Muslim-majority countries. \"We get together regularly. We get together with more senior people. I participate in these conversations. We compare notes,\" he said. When asked by Business Insider for more information about which executives were involved in those meetings \u2014 and, specifically, whether they include leadership from the scandal-plagued Facebook \u2014 Smith deflected the question. \"We definitely have meetings with very senior people at very successful companies to talk about what's happening in the world. What are the issues that people see? What positions people have and how can we take steps together,\" he said. He added, \"you can sort of put the pieces together,\" implying that perhaps Facebook, and maybe even people at the level of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg or COO Sheryl Sandberg, come to the table. Smith went so far as to suggest that the tech industry could use more such togetherness. \"To some degree we would benefit if we had a few more of those issues that would compel us [big tech companies] to come together,\" he said. It makes sense for Microsoft to attend these meetings: Microsoft was the first of today's big internet company to face regulation. Back in the '90s, Microsoft was sued by the government over its business practices, labeled a monopoly, and forced to change its ways under regulatory scrutiny. Read: MacKenzie Bezos deserves half of Jeff Bezos' fortune because there would be no Amazon without her[1] Asked what he thinks about internet companies under similar scrutiny today, his answer was surprising. He thinks of the people involved at each company and has \"sympathy\" for them, he said. The companies that have been under the spotlight lately include Facebook, Microsoft's rivals at Google, and, to a lesser extent, Amazon and Twitter. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter have all testified to Congress, asked about everything from their role in the elections to their company's political leanings to their handling of data breaches. Smith was part of Microsoft back when it was sued by the government, and recalls that this was a difficult process for the company. He said the first part of dealing with regulatory scrutiny is looking in the mirror and being honest with yourself. \"It's about listening to, and ultimately internalizing, criticism,\" he said, noting that this is something that's simply hard for many human beings to do. \"I therefore always have sympathy for people,\" he said.NOW WATCH: North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un is 35 \u2014 here's

NBC`s chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson has details on that. Hallie, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HALLIE JACKSON (07:06:20): Hey, Craig, good morning. President Trump is staying away from specifics but hinting new regulations may be in the works for Google, the latest battle for a President who`s seen plenty of them. But this time, Google is fighting back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Begin VT)</p><p>HALLIE JACKSON (07:06:33): This morning, President Trump leaning in to that tough talk against big tech accusing those companies of bias against conservatives. The President tweeting this video showing images of the Google homepage supposedly taken during the Obama years, then in 2017 and 2018 without mention of President Trump`s speeches. Donald Trump including the #StopTheBias. The only problem? Google says it`s not true releasing its own statement shortly after Donald Trump`s tweet saying they did promote the President`s 2018 address, quote, \"On January 30, 2018, we highlighted the livestream of President Trump`s State of the Union on the google.com homepage. We have historically not promoted the first address to Congress by a new President, which is technically not a State of the Union address. As a result, we didn`t include a promotion on google.com for this address in either 2009 or 2017.\" The President`s former adviser, Steve Bannon, weighing in overnight bashing the executives of Facebook, Twitter, and Google calling them sociopaths, quote, \"These people are complete narcissists. These people ought to be controlled, they ought to be regulated,\" Bannon said to a CNN reporter. \"These people are evil. There is no doubt about that.\" This war of words coming just days after the President, who built his base on social media, started attacking it.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (07:07:50): Well, I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. You know what we want? Not regulation. We want fairness. We have fairness, we`re all very happy.</p><p>HALLIE JACKSON (07:08:02): The President claims, \"Google search results for Trump News shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media,\" as he tweeted earlier this week, adding \"Google and others are controlling what we can and cannot see.\" There`s no reliable data to back up the President`s claim. Tech journalist Kara Swisher casting doubt on all of it this morning in a New York Times op-ed writing, \"Rather than attacking techies, he should send them a gold-embossed thank you note,\" Swisher says.\" Here`s the truest conundrum of the social media age: those who complain loudest about being silenced never ever shut up.\"</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:08:34): So, Hallie, while the President takes on tech, there`s also this controversy that`s surrounding this-- the Senate race down in Florida. What`s happening there?</p><p>HALLIE JACKSON (07:08:43): Yeah. The race for governor that we talked about just yesterday, Craig, on this show. So today, the race is only in day two but already there is an uproar after what was an upset on both sides of the aisle. You had Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis winning his primary. It means he`s now going up against the progressive mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, the first African-American major party nominee for governor in Florida history and the guy who shocked the establishment with his surprise win. So here is what DeSantis said. Watch.</p><p>RON DESANTIS (Fox News/Fox &amp; Friends) (07:09:12): You know, he is an articulate spokesman for those far left views. The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda.</p><p>HALLIE JACKSON (07:09:23): So Florida Democrats describe those comments, that phrase, \"monkey this up,\" as disgusting, as racist dog whistles. DeSantis` campaign insists, and I`m quoting here, \"The candidate was obviously talking about Florida not making the wrong decision to embrace the socialist policies that Andrew Gillum espouses. To characterize it as anything else is absurd.\" So what does Gillum say about all this? He says he thinks Florida is better than this. Craig.</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:09:46): Alrighty. Hallie Jackson for us this morning from the White House. Hallie, thank you.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:09:49): Also this morning, a former Texas police officer has now been sentenced, fifteen years in prison for the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager. Roy Oliver was convicted, Tuesday, in the 2017 death of fifteen-year-old Jordan Edwards. The teen was in the passenger`s seat of a car leaving a party when the officer opened fire. The officer claimed the car was moving toward his partner. Oliver`s half-sister testified against him on Wednesday confirming that she sent his mother a Facebook message saying, quote, \"I hope he gets what he deserves because he took an innocent life.\"</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:10:23): Now to a stunning new twist in that disturbing case of alleged child abuse at a desert compound in New Mexico. Prosecutors said the kids were being trained to kill there. So why were most of the charges suddenly dropped? NBC`s Gadi Schwartz has followed the investigation from the start. He joins us from the scene this morning. Gadi, what`s happening?</p><p>GADI SCHWARTZ (07:10:45): Yeah. Good morning, Craig. Shocking to say the least, three of those five defendants have been released from jail. Their charges dropped because the prosecution blew an important deadline even though the sheriff himself asked prosecutors about that deadline three days before it lapsed. This, as we are now hearing more details about an alleged terror plot.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>JUDGE JEFF MCELORY (District Court Judge; in court) (07:11:09): It is disturbing to me that the district attorney would put this court in that kind of a situation.</p><p>GADI SCHWARTZ (07:11:16): Seeming at times irritated, the judge said he had no choice but to free three of the five defendants after prosecutors failed to hold a preliminary hearing within ten days.</p><p>JUDGE JEFF MCELORY (in court) (07:11:26): I must dismiss these charges.</p><p>GADI SCHWARTZ (07:11:28): The court noting the district attorney`s office could have requested an extension for extraordinary circumstances but didn`t. Prosecutors can refile charges against the three who are released. Suspects Siraj Wahhaj and his partner Jany Leveille remain in custody on charges of child abuse leading to the death of three-year-old Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. His body discovered after the raid in this underground tunnel. The criminal complaint says the couple, \".denied (Abdul-Ghani) medical treatment and medication. The failure to provide medical treatment and/or prescribed medications caused AG`s death.\" This week, the body was returned to Georgia where the boy`s mother lives. Meanwhile, authorities have revealed some of the evidence found at the compound. A journal, they say, was written by Jany Leveille describing, quote, \".phases of a terrorist attack....\" According to prosecutors, interviews with some of the children revealed that, quote, \"Miss Leveille intended to confront `corrupt` institutions or individuals, such as the military, big businesses, CIA, teachers/schools, and reveal the truth to these corrupt institutions or individuals\". Wahhaj was to shoot or otherwise attack the non-believer, according to the affidavit. There have been some questions and criticism about law enforcement`s handling of the case. Overnight, the Taos County sheriff releasing a statement on Facebook saying in part, \"I will defend that TCSO stepped up and put the search warrants and charges together lawfully and correctly.\" The FBI declining repeated request for comment from NBC News including why weapons and other potential evidence were left behind and why authorities later destroyed much of the compound. The sheriff saying the compound land isn`t evidence that everything there was collected, photographed and documented properly. The other eleven children are still in foster care. The three defendants who are now free are expected to stay in Taos County.</p><p>MEGAN MITSUNAGA (Defense Attorney) (07:13:13): The conditions as far as remaining in the county are as long as that criminal trespass case is pending and we`ll do what we can to try to make that case go away as soon as possible.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:13:23): Gadi, I think the question on everyone`s mind this morning is how could this possibly have happened? How could-- how could the prosecutors seem to have dropped the ball in such a way?</p><p>GADI SCHWARTZ (07:13:34): Yeah. That is a big question, Craig. And here in New Mexico, a lot of people are saying this is incompetence. I mean, you saw after all this happened, how we were allowed to go to that compound and look around with the property owner`s permission. While we were there, we saw many journals that sound very similar to what prosecutors are now saying there was an alleged terror plot inside. Those were laying around. Those were uncollected and many of them still might be out there. The district attorney last night responded to a text saying that there is a chance that they might-- may file new charges against those three suspects or possibly take this all to a grand jury. Guys, back to you.</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:14:13): Gadi Schwartz for us there in New Mexico. Gadi, thank you.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:14:15): And you wonder where the federal authorities are.</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:14:17): Yeah.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:14:18): This is a terrorism case or suspected terrorism case. We`ll continue to follow it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBCNEW-2018083002cb501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBCNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T58-JGD1-JB20-G05X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157446</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018  ASC Services II Media, LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved<br/></copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Broadcasting Co.

NBC's chief White House correspondent  Hallie Jackson has details on that. Hallie, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HALLIE JACKSON (07:06:20): Hey, Craig, good morning. President Trump is  staying away from specifics but hinting new regulations may be in the works  for Google, the latest battle for a President who's seen plenty of them.  But this time, Google is fighting back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Begin VT)</p><p>HALLIE JACKSON (07:06:33): This morning, President Trump leaning in to that  tough talk against big tech accusing those companies of bias against  conservatives. The President tweeting this video showing images of the  Google homepage supposedly taken during the Obama years, then in 2017 and  2018 without mention of President Trump's speeches. Donald Trump including  the #StopTheBias. The only problem? Google says it's not true releasing its  own statement shortly after Donald Trump's tweet saying they did promote  the President's 2018 address, quote, \"On January 30, 2018, we highlighted  the livestream of President Trump's State of the Union on the google.com  homepage. We have historically not promoted the first address to Congress  by a new President, which is technically not a State of the Union address.  As a result, we didn't include a promotion on google.com for this address  in either 2009 or 2017.\" The President's former adviser, Steve Bannon,  weighing in overnight bashing the executives of Facebook, Twitter, and  Google calling them sociopaths, quote, \"These people are complete  narcissists. These people ought to be controlled, they ought to be  regulated,\" Bannon said to a CNN reporter. \"These people are evil. There is  no doubt about that.\" This war of words coming just days after the  President, who built his base on social media, started attacking it.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (07:07:50): Well, I think that Google and Facebook  and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very  unfairly. You know what we want? Not regulation. We want fairness. We have  fairness, we're all very happy.</p><p>HALLIE JACKSON (07:08:02): The President claims, \"Google search results for  Trump News shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media,\" as he  tweeted earlier this week, adding \"Google and others are controlling what  we can and cannot see.\" There's no reliable data to back up the President's  claim. Tech journalist Kara Swisher casting doubt on all of it this morning  in a New York Times op-ed writing, \"Rather than attacking techies, he  should send them a gold-embossed thank you note,\" Swisher says.\" Here's the  truest conundrum of the social media age: those who complain loudest about  being silenced never ever shut up.\"</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:08:34): So, Hallie, while the President takes on tech,  there's also this controversy that's surrounding this-- the Senate race  down in Florida. What's happening there?</p><p>HALLIE JACKSON (07:08:43): Yeah. The race for governor that we talked about  just yesterday, Craig, on this show. So today, the race is only in day two  but already there is an uproar after what was an upset on both sides of the  aisle. You had Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis winning his primary. It  means he's now going up against the progressive mayor of Tallahassee,  Andrew Gillum, the first African-American major party nominee for governor  in Florida history and the guy who shocked the establishment with his  surprise win. So here is what DeSantis said. Watch.</p><p>RON DESANTIS (Fox News/Fox &amp; Friends) (07:09:12): You know, he is an  articulate spokesman for those far left views. The last thing we need to do  is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda.</p><p>HALLIE JACKSON (07:09:23): So Florida Democrats describe those comments,  that phrase, \"monkey this up,\" as disgusting, as racist dog whistles.  DeSantis' campaign insists, and I'm quoting here, \"The candidate was  obviously talking about Florida not making the wrong decision to embrace  the socialist policies that Andrew Gillum espouses. To characterize it as  anything else is absurd.\" So what does Gillum say about all this? He says  he thinks Florida is better than this. Craig.</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:09:46): Alrighty. Hallie Jackson for us this morning from  the White House. Hallie, thank you.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:09:49): Also this morning, a former Texas police  officer has now been sentenced, fifteen years in prison for the fatal  shooting of an unarmed black teenager. Roy Oliver was convicted, Tuesday,  in the 2017 death of fifteen-year-old Jordan Edwards. The teen was in the  passenger's seat of a car leaving a party when the officer opened fire. The  officer claimed the car was moving toward his partner. Oliver's half-sister  testified against him on Wednesday confirming that she sent his mother a  Facebook message saying, quote, \"I hope he gets what he deserves because he  took an innocent life.\"</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:10:23): Now to a stunning new twist in that disturbing  case of alleged child abuse at a desert compound in New Mexico. Prosecutors  said the kids were being trained to kill there. So why were most of the  charges suddenly dropped? NBC's Gadi Schwartz has followed the  investigation from the start. He joins us from the scene this morning.  Gadi, what's happening?</p><p>GADI SCHWARTZ (07:10:45): Yeah. Good morning, Craig. Shocking to say the  least, three of those five defendants have been released from jail. Their  charges dropped because the prosecution blew an important deadline even  though the sheriff himself asked prosecutors about that deadline three days  before it lapsed. This, as we are now hearing more details about an alleged  terror plot.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>JUDGE JEFF MCELORY (District Court Judge; in court) (07:11:09): It is  disturbing to me that the district attorney would put this court in that  kind of a situation.</p><p>GADI SCHWARTZ (07:11:16): Seeming at times irritated, the judge said he had  no choice but to free three of the five defendants after prosecutors failed  to hold a preliminary hearing within ten days.</p><p>JUDGE JEFF MCELORY (in court) (07:11:26): I must dismiss these charges.</p><p>GADI SCHWARTZ (07:11:28): The court noting the district attorney's office  could have requested an extension for extraordinary circumstances but  didn't. Prosecutors can refile charges against the three who are released.  Suspects Siraj Wahhaj and his partner Jany Leveille remain in custody on  charges of child abuse leading to the death of three-year-old Abdul-Ghani  Wahhaj. His body discovered after the raid in this underground tunnel. The  criminal complaint says the couple, \".denied (Abdul-Ghani) medical  treatment and medication. The failure to provide medical treatment and/or  prescribed medications caused AG's death.\" This week, the body was returned  to Georgia where the boy's mother lives. Meanwhile, authorities have  revealed some of the evidence found at the compound. A journal, they say,  was written by Jany Leveille describing, quote, \".phases of a terrorist  attack....\" According to prosecutors, interviews with some of the children  revealed that, quote, \"Miss Leveille intended to confront 'corrupt'  institutions or individuals, such as the military, big businesses, CIA,  teachers/schools, and reveal the truth to these corrupt institutions or  individuals\". Wahhaj was to shoot or otherwise attack the non-believer,  according to the affidavit. There have been some questions and criticism  about law enforcement's handling of the case. Overnight, the Taos County  sheriff releasing a statement on Facebook saying in part, \"I will defend  that TCSO stepped up and put the search warrants and charges together  lawfully and correctly.\" The FBI declining repeated request for comment  from NBC News including why weapons and other potential evidence were left  behind and why authorities later destroyed much of the compound. The  sheriff saying the compound land isn't evidence that everything there was  collected, photographed and documented properly. The other eleven children  are still in foster care. The three defendants who are now free are  expected to stay in Taos County.</p><p>MEGAN MITSUNAGA (Defense Attorney) (07:13:13): The conditions as far as  remaining in the county are as long as that criminal trespass case is  pending and we'll do what we can to try to make that case go away as soon  as possible.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:13:23): Gadi, I think the question on everyone's mind this  morning is how could this possibly have happened? How could-- how could the  prosecutors seem to have dropped the ball in such a way?</p><p>GADI SCHWARTZ (07:13:34): Yeah. That is a big question, Craig. And here in  New Mexico, a lot of people are saying this is incompetence. I mean, you  saw after all this happened, how we were allowed to go to that compound and  look around with the property owner's permission. While we were there, we  saw many journals that sound very similar to what prosecutors are now  saying there was an alleged terror plot inside. Those were laying around.  Those were uncollected and many of them still might be out there. The  district attorney last night responded to a text saying that there is a  chance that they might-- may file new charges against those three suspects  or possibly take this all to a grand jury. Guys, back to you.</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:14:13): Gadi Schwartz for us there in New Mexico. Gadi,  thank you.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:14:15): And you wonder where the federal authorities  are.</p><p>CRAIG MELVIN (07:14:17): Yeah.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:14:18): This is a terrorism case or suspected  terrorism case. We'll continue to follow it.</p><p>END    </p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 NBCUniversal.  ALL RIGHTS   RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

The virus, they said, was akin to a seasonal flu.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although a video of their remarks quickly got more than 5 million views on YouTube, the pair also drew condemnation and ridicule. The American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, for example, said \"it appears these two individuals are releasing biased, non-peer-reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the public's health.\"</p><p>When YouTube took down the video for violating its guidelines, however, some critics cited the move as an example of \"Big Tech\" bias against conservatives. The fact that YouTube isn't making the doctors' advice not to stay at home and \"develop a weak immune system\" available to millions of people is, to these critics, an offense against free speech.</p><p>Such complaints have been circulating for several years, ever since YouTube, Facebook and other tech giants started trying to weed out misinformation in the wake of Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Never mind that foreign meddling has continued and that the companies have proven inefficient and inept (or worse) at scouring falsehoods from their platforms. To critics on the right, the signal problem posed by Big Tech is the allegedly uneven enforcement of those companies' rules.</p><p>President Trump upped the ante Thursday with an executive order that threatens to expose online platform operators to more lawsuits if they take \"deceptive or pretextual actions\" to remove content, even if it violates their terms of service. The order also seeks to have the Federal Communications Commission -- the agency that famously ruled in 2018 that it has no authority to regulate the internet -- regulate how online platforms enforce their terms of service, while having the Federal Trade Commission investigate whether the companies' enforcement efforts were unfair and deceptive.</p><p>It's a ridiculous overreach built on anecdotes about bias rather than research. It pretends that the liability shield Congress provided in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act enabled Big Tech companies to become global behemoths, rather than feckless antitrust enforcement. And it ignores the fact that the tech giants can survive without Section 230, while the upstarts that would compete with them cannot.</p><p>The president's move apparently was triggered by Twitter flagging two of his tweets about mail-in ballots Tuesday as misleading. The opinion Trump offered in those tweets about voter fraud was wrapped around a whopper of a falsehood: that Gov. Gavin Newsom was sending ballots to \"anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there\" -- a not-subtle reference to non-citizens and to migrants living in the country illegally.</p><p>Nevertheless, argued White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, Twitter demonstrated its bias against Trump by not flagging the disinformation campaigns waged by Chinese officials on Twitter regarding its suppression of religious minorities, the anti-government protests in Hong Kong and the origin of the new coronavirus. But those failures point to a different problem, one shared to varying degrees by every online platform: Far too much bad information is circulating. That's true in part because the sites' own algorithms may promote it, and in part because bad actors use the sites to try to manipulate audiences on a vast scale.</p><p>Trump hasn't been a victim of bias; he's been the prime beneficiary of the platforms' lax and inconsistent enforcement of their terms of service. It's richly ironic that the president would want to remove liability protections for the platforms that broadcast the damaging rumors and wild conspiracy theories he spreads about his rivals. Trump's critics have asked Twitter repeatedly to remove Trump tweets that violated Twitter's policies, but the company never did. It is now reaping what it sowed.</p><p>The problem illustrated by the Bakersfield doctors is that seemingly every issue these days draws a polarized response. We all have complaints about how powerful Big Tech has become and how the various companies do and do not enforce their terms of service. But having the government regulate those decisions won't make them better. It will only force the companies to bend their policies to the whims of whichever administration happens to be in power.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LATN-C06E25RA</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601G-N331-DXXV-300V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306910</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Los Angeles Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Los Angeles Times</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 31, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Editorial</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The only problem is that there is no actual deal there. To be sure, there's pressure to strike a deal. For some time, news reports have indicated that the Trump administration was not anxious to continue ramping up tariffs, and it was also seeking to lessen the pain of Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. </p><p>Since the trade war started in earnest, rumors and regular variations of tariff delays by the United States in return for incremental purchases or policy changes such as a reduction in fentanyl exports circulated. There has been little progress, ultimately resulting in incremental escalation as Washington accused Beijing of not honoring their agreement by not buying soybeans or stemming the flow of fentanyl. In the lead-up to the visit by China's lead trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, numerous reports[1] indicated both sides were seriously considering a partial trade deal. The thinking went that this would allow for an easing of tensions as more substantive deeper agreement was hammered out between each side. Each side is under significant pressure due to domestic politics to strike a deal. Despite rosy headline numbers of GDP growth, the Chinese economy is under enormous pressure. Chinese imports in U.S. dollars fell 8.5 percent year on year last month\u2014having fallen consistently throughout 2019, indicating broad weakness. Consumer goods sales are flat or falling significantly, and unreported capital outflows[2] have reached their highest level in years as people move their money out of China. With the threat of an impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump and election season ramping up simultaneously with a decelerating economy, the Trump administration is looking to go into 2020 with some movement on its signature trade policy issue. The fundamental problem with the deal, however, is that it doesn't seem to actually exist. As of Monday in Asia, there was no official text of the agreement between the United States and China. Officially, Chinese state media would only say that 'substantial progress' had been made. Even U.S. officials still said they would be papering over the agreement, and it remained unclear how big any agricultural purchases would be, over what period, and whether any currency or intellectual property commitments would be included. In short, while a more material deal may spring forth in the coming days, there is nothing substantive at present. The bigger problem is the United States and China agree on almost nothing. They do not agree on the problems, how to solve them, or even what the broad objectives should be. China does not accept the U.S. position that domestic subsidies and industrial policy are negotiable topics, while the United States does not accept the Chinese position that Huawei is a trade issue. Nor do they agree on the general objective. While openness and liberalization are generally taken as the foundational motivating objective of trade negotiations, China has not and does not accept the premise. Each side spent significant time recently removing key issues from the negotiating table. Reports indicated that China refused to discuss industrial policy and subsidies, a key complaint from Washington. The Trump administration refused to discuss Huawei, other Chinese firms on the entity[3] list, or the companies sanctioned over their involvement in Xinjiang. A major driver of the significantly smaller deal is that each side has drawn a series of red lines around many issues, leaving relatively little to discuss. Given the ambiguous nature of the agreement and its limited scope, there's little reason to have confidence this will result in a more lasting basis to move forward. Multiple times within the past 15 months, supposed agreements[4] have emerged\u2014including a supposed delay of U.S. tariff increases and Chinese purchases of agriculture\u2014only to fall apart. Even if there is ultimately an agreement on the basics, it is important to set realistic expectations for successful execution. Looking at currency management, the outlook darkens further. Though the Trump administration may not appreciate the falling renminbi, there is not strong evidence that China has been politically manipulating the currency to offset tariff increases. The currency is pegged to a basket of currencies effectively replicating a U.S. dollar index, so the decline in the yuan in 2019 has been driven by the increase in the U.S. dollar, not political manipulation. Washington, however, still wants a stronger yuan to decrease the trade imbalance. The problem for China is that it cannot commit to credible changes to currency mechanisms without incurring major risks to its economy. Arbitrarily raising the yuan through such measures as a change to the basket, as the Trump administration is likely pressuring Beijing, risks negatively impacting any surplus. Easing currency flows is likely to leave the Trump administration even more unhappy given the strong probability it would push the yuan down as capital flowed out. Any agreement on currency pricing in this situation will need both specific valuation description and a pricing mechanism to be credible. Otherwise it will be little more than flowery words. There is a similar Gordian knot on intellectual property. Despite years of pressure from the United States and decades of promises from Beijing, China continues to engage in a variety of practices ranging from the problematic, such as forced technology transfer, to the outright illegal, such as the theft of U.S. companies' intellectual property rights. To combat this, the Trump administration has given law enforcement and regulators wide latitude to pursue economic and security espionage cases, hacking, and forced technology transfer cases. Given the scope of the problem, they have sought an agreement with China on intellectual property protection, something Beijing has and continued to refuse. Any inclusion of intellectual property is like currency\u2014little more than toothless reiteration of general talking points about the importance of respecting intellectual property. Both sides have talked of future agreements being signed in December that would include a wider range of issues. But there's little reason for optimism. Any deal means nothing without serious enforcement mechanisms\u2014a difficult, perhaps impossible, step for China, which ardently resists any oversight of its practices. When trade negotiations fell apart the first time it was due to the Beijing side, reportedly under direct orders from Chinese President Xi Jinping, stating that it would accept no tangible enforcement mechanism[5]. Trade wars are unpredictable, as is the Trump administration. It's certainly possible a deal will still emerge in the end. But the Chinese Communist Party's stance against openness, against oversight, and against liberalization is predictable\u2014and that may be the best thing to bet on here.

The nonprofit organization NOYB \u2014 short for \u201cnone of your business\u201d \u2014 claimed that <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook, along with two of Facebook\u2019s subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram, failed to give European users specific control over the use of their data, in violation of the new rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The <url normalizedValue=\"https://noyb.eu/\">complaints</url>, which were filed in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria, ask regulators to impose fines of as much as $4.3 billion on <person><nameText>Google</nameText></person>\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and $1.5 billion each on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 roughly 4 percent of each company\u2019s 2017 revenue, the maximum penalty allowed under the G.D.P.R.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even for cash-flush tech giants, those would be painful checks to write.</p><p>The architect of NOYB\u2019s campaign is Max Schrems, 30, an Austrian lawyer who has made a career of hounding American tech giants over their data-collection practices. Several years ago, when he was still in law school, Mr. Schrems took on Facebook with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/technology/06iht-rawdata06.html\">series of legal complaints</url>, claiming the social network was violating European data protection laws.</p><p>Later, Mr. Schrems successfully challenged the \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d policies that let tech companies store data about Europeans in the United States. That case sent shock waves through the tech industry, and made him a hero among digital privacy hawks. Edward Snowden, the whistle-blower and activist, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/snowden/status/651384292728250368?lang=en\">declared</url> that Mr. Schrems had \u201cchanged the world for the better.\u201d</p><p>I spoke with Mr. Schrems on Monday, several days after the start of his new privacy crusade. He said that while the timing of his latest volley was mainly symbolic \u2014 the organization had been preparing complaints against Facebook and <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>for months \u2014 its substance was very real.</p><p>\u201cIt was important to point that out the first day, that this is not compliant,\u201d Mr. Schrems told me. Facebook and <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>he said, have \u201cfundamentally tried to ignore or redefine\u201d the new European laws by forcing users to consent to wide-ranging data collection, without telling them exactly how their data would be used.</p><p>\u201cAll of these cases should be absolutely won,\u201d he added.</p><p>Tech companies never thought that Europe\u2019s data collection rules would be painless. But they may not have anticipated the chaos that unfurled last week, as lawyers rushed to tease apart the law\u2019s complications and companies barraged people with messages about their new, G.D.P.R.-compliant privacy policies.</p><p>As other countries also look to establish their own European-style privacy regulations, the potential impact of the G.D.P.R. across the globe has turned a feeding frenzy of ambitious lawyers, lobbyists and activists into a kind of crowdsourced rule-making process that will ultimately determine how the new rules are enforced.</p><p>There has already been fallout from the G.D.P.R. in the digital media and advertising industries, where the new rules caused several American publications to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/media/europe-privacy-gdpr-us.html\">shut themselves off</url> to European users and the market for certain invasive types of digital advertising       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://digiday.com/media/gdpr-mayhem-programmatic-ad-buying-plummets-europe/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmediatrends&amp;stream=top\">dried up</url>. Faced with the prospect of stiff penalties, a few smaller American tech companies       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/05/unroll-me-to-close-to-eu-users-saying-it-cant-comply-with-gdpr/\">threw up their hands</url> and stopped serving Europe altogether.</p><p>As global companies, Facebook and <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>don\u2019t have the option of cutting off the Continent. In statements, both companies defended their data collection practices, saying they fully complied with the new European regulations.</p><p>\u201cWe have prepared for the past 18 months to ensure we meet the requirements of the G.D.P.R.,\u201d Erin Egan, Facebook\u2019s chief privacy officer, said in a statement. \u201cWe have made our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find, and introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information.\u201d</p><p>A <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>spokesman, Al Verney, said, \u201cWe build privacy and security into our products from the very earliest stages and are committed to complying with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation.\u201d</p><p>At the core of Mr. Schrems\u2019s complaints is the question of whether tech companies are giving people realistic choices about how their data is collected and used.</p><p>Like many companies, Facebook and <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>which developed the Android mobile operating system, prompted users last week to accept new terms of service that explained their data collection particulars. Facebook members who declined to accept the new terms were unable to log into their accounts. Android users who didn\u2019t agree to the new terms were, in effect, locked out of their phones.</p><p>Mr. Schrems said these all-or-nothing privacy policies violated the G.D.P.R.\u2019s requirement that consent be particularized and \u201cfreely given.\u201d To comply with the law, he said, large tech platforms need to give privacy-conscious users the option of sharing certain types of data but not others.</p><p>Realistically, Mr. Schrems said, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to walk away from all your friends on Facebook.\u201d</p><p>Opponents of the G.D.P.R. have said the law could end up backfiring by making it harder for smaller companies, which don\u2019t tend to have huge teams of European legal experts at their disposal, to compete with the American tech giants. It could mean that European users are required to pay more for certain internet services, to offset reduced advertising revenue. (The Washington Post is <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/adrianweckler/status/999999494988197889\">already offering</url> an ad- and tracking-free \u201cpremium E.U. subscription\u201d that costs 50 percent more than a regular subscription.) In a worst-case scenario, it could turn Europe into a kind of technological dead zone, a place where influential American tech companies simply refuse to tread.</p><p>Mr. Schrems shrugged off these concerns. The European market is too lucrative for companies like <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook to abandon, he said. And he doesn\u2019t believe that social networks and search engines would suffer unduly if they were forced to be more judicious about how they collected fine-grain data about people for the purposes of selling more ads.</p><p>\u201cYou can still make a lot of money without microtargeting,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mr. Schrems\u2019s quest is far from finished. Regulators could decide not to pursue investigations, expensive litigation could drag on for years, and Silicon Valley companies are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/technology/europe-gdpr-privacy.html\">furiously adding lobbyists</url> to try to influence the nascent rule-making process.</p><p>But if these types of complaints succeed \u2014 and it\u2019s not entirely crazy to think that they could, given the current antipathy toward American tech giants and the satisfaction that European officials might take in kneecapping a few of them \u2014 it could be a watershed moment for large tech companies.</p><p>\u201cMassive fines in this case would have pretty significant repercussions,\u201d said Courtney M.

The nonprofit organization NOYB - short for \"none of your business\" - claimed that Google and Facebook, along with two of Facebook's subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram, failed to give European users specific control over the use of their data, in violation of the new rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The complaints, which were filed in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria, ask regulators to impose fines of as much as $4.3 billion on Google's parent company, Alphabet, and $1.5 billion each on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - roughly 4 percent of each company's 2017 revenue, the maximum penalty allowed under the G.D.P.R.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even for cash-flush tech giants, those would be painful checks to write.</p><p>The architect of NOYB's campaign is Max Schrems, 30, an Austrian lawyer who has made a career of hounding American tech giants over their data-collection practices. Several years ago, when he was still in law school, Mr. Schrems took on Facebook with a series of legal complaints, claiming the social network was violating European data protection laws.</p><p>Later, Mr. Schrems successfully challenged the \"Safe Harbor\" policies that let tech companies store data about Europeans in the United States. That case sent shock waves through the tech industry, and made him a hero among digital privacy hawks. Edward Snowden, the whistle-blower and activist, declared that Mr. Schrems had \"changed the world for the better.\"</p><p>I spoke with Mr. Schrems on Monday, several days after the start of his new privacy crusade. He said that while the timing of his latest volley was mainly symbolic - the organization had been preparing complaints against Facebook and Google for months - its substance was very real.</p><p>\"It was important to point that out the first day, that this is not compliant,\" Mr. Schrems told me. Facebook and Google, he said, have \"fundamentally tried to ignore or redefine\" the new European laws by forcing users to consent to wide-ranging data collection, without telling them exactly how their data would be used.</p><p>\"All of these cases should be absolutely won,\" he added.</p><p>Tech companies never thought that Europe's data collection rules would be painless. But they may not have anticipated the chaos that unfurled last week, as lawyers rushed to tease apart the law's complications and companies barraged people with messages about their new, G.D.P.R.-compliant privacy policies.</p><p>As other countries also look to establish their own European-style privacy regulations, the potential impact of the G.D.P.R. across the globe has turned a feeding frenzy of ambitious lawyers, lobbyists and activists into a kind of crowdsourced rule-making process that will ultimately determine how the new rules are enforced.</p><p>There has already been fallout from the G.D.P.R. in the digital media and advertising industries, where the new rules caused several American publications to shut themselves off to European users and the market for certain invasive types of digital advertising dried up. Faced with the prospect of stiff penalties, a few smaller American tech companies threw up their hands and stopped serving Europe altogether.</p><p>As global companies, Facebook and Google don't have the option of cutting off the Continent. In statements, both companies defended their data collection practices, saying they fully complied with the new European regulations.</p><p>\"We have prepared for the past 18 months to ensure we meet the requirements of the G.D.P.R.,\" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, said in a statement. \"We have made our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find, and introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information.\"</p><p>A Google spokesman, Al Verney, said, \"We build privacy and security into our products from the very earliest stages and are committed to complying with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation.\"</p><p>At the core of Mr. Schrems's complaints is the question of whether tech companies are giving people realistic choices about how their data is collected and used.</p><p>Like many companies, Facebook and Google, which developed the Android mobile operating system, prompted users last week to accept new terms of service that explained their data collection particulars. Facebook members who declined to accept the new terms were unable to log into their accounts. Android users who didn't agree to the new terms were, in effect, locked out of their phones.</p><p>Mr. Schrems said these all-or-nothing privacy policies violated the G.D.P.R.'s requirement that consent be particularized and \"freely given.\" To comply with the law, he said, large tech platforms need to give privacy-conscious users the option of sharing certain types of data but not others.</p><p>Realistically, Mr. Schrems said, \"you're not going to walk away from all your friends on Facebook.\"</p><p>Opponents of the G.D.P.R. have said the law could end up backfiring by making it harder for smaller companies, which don't tend to have huge teams of European legal experts at their disposal, to compete with the American tech giants. It could mean that European users are required to pay more for certain internet services, to offset reduced advertising revenue. (The Washington Post is already offering an ad- and tracking-free \"premium E.U. subscription\" that costs 50 percent more than a regular subscription.) In a worst-case scenario, it could turn Europe into a kind of technological dead zone, a place where influential American tech companies simply refuse to tread.</p><p>Mr. Schrems shrugged off these concerns. The European market is too lucrative for companies like Google and Facebook to abandon, he said. And he doesn't believe that social networks and search engines would suffer unduly if they were forced to be more judicious about how they collected fine-grain data about people for the purposes of selling more ads.</p><p>\"You can still make a lot of money without microtargeting,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Schrems's quest is far from finished. Regulators could decide not to pursue investigations, expensive litigation could drag on for years, and Silicon Valley companies are furiously adding lobbyists to try to influence the nascent rule-making process.</p><p>But if these types of complaints succeed - and it's not entirely crazy to think that they could, given the current antipathy toward American tech giants and the satisfaction that European officials might take in kneecapping a few of them - it could be a watershed moment for large tech companies.</p><p>\"Massive fines in this case would have pretty significant repercussions,\" said Courtney M. Bowman, a lawyer at the firm Proskauer Rose who specializes in international privacy law. \"It would be a strong signal from the E.U. authorities that this isn't just a law that's on the books that isn't going to be enforced,\" she said.</p><p>Whether or not Facebook and Google end up paying billion-dollar fines, it's clear that the G.D.P.R. has already introduced a new, scary variable into Silicon Valley's privacy calculations.

Europeans have a long history of privacy invasions. During World War II , the Nazi regime used highly sensitive personal data from local population registers to locate and round up Jews, with horrifying results. Later, in communist East Germany, the reach of the combined secret police and intelligence agency Stasi extended into every aspect of civilian life as surveillance and repression of dissent were perfected. It's not surprising that against this backdrop, Europe has made \u2014 and continues to make \u2014 great strides in ensuring the privacy of its people.    Today, the differences between the privacy mindset in Europe and the U.S. are obvious in the digital arena. It's become the norm in the U.S. that online behavior gets tracked and used for a slew of subsequent manipulation. U.S. legislation isn't even close to providing adequate protection of consumer privacy interests. In internet privacy rankings , 14 of the top 20 countries demonstrating the highest commitment to digital privacy are European (the U.S. placed 18th). There are reasons for that \u2014 not the least of which, I believe, are choices made by U.S. big tech and the government.     Let's explore what puts the U.S. behind Europe in the privacy stakes.    Americans' expectations for privacy.    Unlike the typical mindset in Europe, many Americans choose to believe that their online behavior being tracked happens in their best interests or is a price to pay for getting free or discounted products. Even after Edward Snowden revealed how vastly expanded the government's ability to spy on its own citizens was after Congress passed the Patriot Act legislation, still only half of Americans said they disagreed with the government's actions.    It seemed to take multiple high-profile data breaches for privacy to finally have a \"moment\" that Americans supported . Europeans are still more likely to take charge of their privacy. Of Startpage's split of users, who lean more privacy-conscious, Europe represents 56% of a typical day's private searches overall \u2014 with Germany specifically representing 36% \u2014 and the U.S. representing 21%.    The U.S. overrules EU privacy standards.    While Europe sets some commendable standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is used to police the use of personal information by major companies and organizations online, it does little for Americans' digital privacy rights.    GDPR was adopted on April 14, 2016, and before it became enforceable on May 25, 2018, the U.S. Congress enacted the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act on March 23, 2018. Rather than being compatible with the GDPR, the U.S. CLOUD Act overrules it.    Federal law requires U.S.-based software companies and IT service providers to ensure that authorities can have access to all stored data, including data stored on foreign servers. Furthermore, it guards U.S. service providers from having to tell customers whether authorities have requested their data. European companies can object to any data transfer, but the chances are it will end up with the U.S. government, which can share the data as it likes.    U.S. big tech has too much influence.    There are big structural differences between the EU and the U.S. In the EU, the center of gravity is Brussels , where many politicians from all EU countries meet in order to work and advance together toward concrete results.    The U.S. economic center of gravity is Silicon Valley. When you think about all the personal data that big tech companies can provide to U.S. government intelligence agencies, it's not surprising that there was a \" long history of close cooperation\" between them and intelligence agencies' offices.    I believe many big tech companies have an immense economic interest in making sure any online privacy regulations are weak and do not limit their business models too much because knowledge, to them, can also equal power.    One lobbying group that represents internet companies is striving for a federal privacy law that would preempt more state regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which actually makes real progress. Its ideal federal privacy law would undermine the CCPA to essentially let companies return to business as normal and also make it impossible for other states to set the bar even higher.    When I think about macro trends such as America's competition against China, it's easy to see how the government could favor weaker federal privacy regulations. After all, restricting the use of consumer data could set U.S. tech companies back significantly against Chinese companies in arenas like artificial intelligence .    Mass surveillance is too easily normalized.    Another threat is the government's work with companies (including U.S. big tech) to use technology to collect potentially sensitive health and location information data in the fight against Covid-19. While there are undeniable safety concerns from the global pandemic, the worry from a privacy perspective is that the U.S. government will use people's fears to normalize mass surveillance.    In contrast, the government in the Netherlands back in April actually abandoned its initial plan to develop a Covid-19 tracing app and appointed a new team to oversee the project due to privacy concerns over the initial seven designs.    The example of Snowden's whistleblowing shows that the U.S. hasn't had the best track record for using its data collection powers all for good or just on a temporary basis. Clearly, the U.S. has a lot of lost ground to be regained when it comes to privacy.    In the meantime, there are ways that Americans can at least try to protect their own digital privacy. I would suggest favoring technology by EU-headquartered companies for better data protection and thinking about how you can go about your daily online activities in a more private way, such as swapping over to private search.

It did so by publicly challenging a court order requiring the company to break the encryption built into its iPhone device.</p><p><br/><br/>Cut to 2018: to the chagrin of privacy advocates everywhere, Apple announced that it would move the data of Chinese users to servers owned by a state-run company to comply with China's data localization law. The company later announced that they would host the encryption keys in China; and that the Chinese partner would \"have access to all data\" of users registered in the country.<br/><br/>An emerging body of scholarship has now examined the role that tech companies play in instances like Apple's clash with the FBI - where \"surveillance intermediaries\" constrain government surveillance, as Alan Rozenshtein argues. Scholars have examined the incentives and tools that tech companies use to resist the government (U.S. government in most analyses) and the net positive effect that it has ushered in for users against surveillance excesses by law enforcement.<br/><br/>What these scholarly attempts have omitted, however, is taking the latter reality into account - where tech companies accede to (sometimes regressive) government demands. The number of internet users in India and China is over four times larger than the United States excluding the number of future users. This fact alone introduces finer nuances that dismantle the existing understanding of financial and policy incentives that drive intermediary behavior.<br/><br/>I lay out in the following sections why tech companies must instead be treated as privacy negotiators - not only advocating for user privacy but negotiating the tradeoff between cooperation or resistance in the short term vs. compliance with unintended regulatory consequences in the long term. Over the past year, the scales have tipped in favor of the latter outcome. The difficulty of obtaining electronic data from U.S. tech companies combined with the historic resistance put forth by these companies has been recognized as the primary reason behind the onerous regulation introduced in India.<br/><br/>In response, tech companies are increasingly relenting to government pressure thereby complying with regulation that is not only poorly designed but one that could pose serious consequences to the privacy of Indian users.<br/><br/>I argue that as privacy negotiators, tech companies are in a unique position in the surveillance architecture to reform cross-border access to data for law enforcement in a manner that secures the privacy interests of Indian (and all foreign) users. Given that these tech companies are privy to the nature of requests and have the legal standing to pushback against the requests- their role as privacy negotiators is established firmly.<br/><br/>In earlier work, I examined the challenges in the current cross-border regime where Indian government requests data from U.S. tech companies, arguing that the respective governments must consider an India-US executive agreement under the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act or CLOUD Act. I argued that such a bilateral agreement would not only ease cross-border access to data and make it more efficient but also safeguard user privacy in the process and ultimately strengthen the overall case against mandatory data localization.<br/><br/>This article takes off from there - given that there is an alternative on the table, there are still no significant advances being made in the conversation. This article explores why. Even while the challenge arising out of the conflict of laws is undeniable, I argue that there is an emerging \"conflict of interests\" which has resulted in tech companies acceding to Indian government's demands for localization. The article, therefore, addresses the gap between current literature that examines the challenge of cross-border access to data and the growing scholarship on governing tech companies as \"information fiduciaries.\"<br/><br/>In Part I, I briefly lay out the challenge of Indian government access to data highlighting how U.S. tech companies have fallen into the role of privacy negotiators. The section also briefly addresses the significant normative turnaround that an India-US executive agreement on data sharing can bring about.<br/><br/>In Part II, I examine how the push for data localization from the Indian government came about and the competing incentives of tech companies that may ultimately drive them to comply with a larger localization mandate.<br/><br/>In Part III, I explore how the recognition of tech companies as data fiduciaries under Indian law may enhance the legal responsibility of privacy negotiators - requiring them not only to pushback against localization but also push for more privacy protecting alternatives such as the CLOUD Act. In the final section, I argue that private tech firms indeed have the clout to push for an executive agreement between India and the U.S. to raise the privacy standards of law enforcement access to data.<br/><br/>This article is limited to examining the regulatory responses stemming from the cross-border conundrum when Indian law enforcement agencies (LEA) request user data from U.S. tech companies whose services are widely used in the country. Any reference to \"tech companies\" in this paper is limited to prominent U.S. tech service providers that are operational worldwide. Their function as privacy negotiators, therefore, is emblematic of the role they carry out in the current surveillance regime - and as I argue later in the article, also indicative of the duty they must discharge towards all users. Developments in India present a compelling lens to examine this contention since companies' recent actions in the country exhibit a decisive turnaround in the incentives that earlier drove their resistance in the surveillance regime worldwide.</p><p>Conflict of Laws<br/><br/>The system for cross-border access to electronic data for criminal investigations between India and the United States has often been criticized for being outdated and time consuming, sometimes taking as long as three years. At the heart of the issue is the conflict of laws between where the user is located, where the company is headquartered and in some cases, where the data is stored.This has led to fragmentation of legal frameworks across jurisdictions and reliance on slow inter-governmental processes like Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT).<br/><br/>Access to electronic data - specifically communications content - has become instrumental not just for crimes committed online but also to further investigations where these crimes cause 'real-world' harm. U.S. tech companies, governed by the Stored Communications Act, disclose non-content data to government agencies that honor the rule of law and respect fundamental rights. Companies only voluntarily disclose content data during exigent circumstances involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person<br/><br/>Under normal circumstances content data can only be shared in response to a warrant issued in the U.S. As a result, in most cases investigating officers in India must obtain a warrant meeting the probable cause standard from a U.S. court through the India-U.S. MLAT to access content data. Due to delays and uncertainties associated with the MLAT process, Indian law enforcement officials often express their dissatisfaction of having to comply with a foreign law, especially while tackling crucial cases. One such instance is the recent case of disinformation spread through WhatsApp that resulted in mob violence and deaths of 27 people.<br/><br/>Given this reality, the Indian government in the past year has called for data to be localized or stored within India's borders. The mandate to store data locally either completely or in the form of \"mirror servers\" is a harmful and ill-suited policy approach for two reasons.<br/><br/>First, mandating data to be localized is especially dangerous to user privacy since police officials in India rely on legacy laws to access electronic data which require no prior authorisation by courts. Legacy laws in India provide that any court or police officer in charge of a police station can compel the production of any \"document or other thing\" that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of an investigation or trial (Source: Section 91, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973). Not only has this power been interpreted broadly but in practice it is only police officers who issue notices to companies requesting user data. This imposes a much lower threshold than the U.S. Probable Cause standard that is currently enforced on Indian users through the MLAT process where the court issues a warrant.<br/><br/>Second, data localization is ill-suited for the stated purpose of law enforcement access. Major service providers may not be able to comply with user data requests from the Indian government since U.S. law still effectively bars these companies from disclosing user data to foreign law enforcement authorities. Even if U.S. companies comply, only data of Indian citizens can be provided. In cases of transnational crimes such as online radicalisation, money laundering and cybercrimes, Indian police will have to continue to rely on cooperative models like the MLAT process.<br/><br/>It is crucial that a common framework is devised that eases the existing conflict of laws and increases institutional cooperation between states to discourage further fragmented developments such as mandatory data localization. Access to electronic data, therefore, must be determined on the basis of where the user is located and not where the data is stored. States must strive towards enacting direct data sharing arrangements between foreign LEAs and technology companies to operationalize this. The CLOUD Act signed into law last year by the U.S. Congress can actualize this for the first time and decentralize control over data from U.S. authorities where popular technology companies are located (This, however, requires an executive agreement between the United States and the foreign country certifying that the state will rely on robust privacy protections, and respect for due process and the rule of law when making requests to companies directly. Such a framework over time, will not only need to be transparent and hold both companies and LEAs accountable but also be scalable to respond to the increasing volume and complexity of requests. Specifically, due process safeguards on user notification, redressal etc. will need to be incorporated. The U.S. Department of Justice recently issued clarifications on how the CLOUD Act will be operationalized available at source).<br/><br/>Even while the CLOUD Act is an imperfect solution - the Act by allowing executive agreements between states to bypass the existing conflict of laws provides a workaround that was earlier unavailable. In effect, an India-U.S. executive agreement under the CLOUD Act would establish a higher standard of privacy protection for Indian users that is currently unavailable under Indian law such as limiting the scope of requests and judicial review.<br/><br/>Conflict of Interests<br/><br/>Push for Data Localization<br/><br/>Calls for mandatory data localization by the Indian government over the past year have emerged as the overwhelming bone of contention. Far from mere rhetoric, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already made it mandatory for all payment service providers to store copies of data locally (Source: Reserve Bank of India Notifications, \"Storage of Payment Systems Data\", Apr. 6, 2018).<br/><br/>India's first draft data protection law imposes mandatory data localization - requiring all data fiduciaries operating in the country to store at least one serving copy of data on a local server (Source: Sections 40 and 41, The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018). The draft law further empowers the government to recognize certain categories of data which must not only be stored but also processed exclusively in the country (Source: Sections 40 and 41, The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018).<br/><br/>Admittedly, this push for data localization is part of a larger strategy that the government is rolling out to reassert their sovereignty in the digital economy. However, in no uncertain terms, the committee drafting the law has cited the difficulty that law enforcement faces in accessing user data during criminal investigations and prosecutions as the primary motive behind the move (Source: Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B.N. Srikrishna, \"A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians\", 27 July 2018). The committee reasons that forcing companies to localize data, even just a copy, can enable \"quick and easy access.\"<br/><br/>The government directive to command cooperation from companies on surveillance is not limited to data localization. The draft amendment rules to the Information Technology Act imposes an obligation on intermediaries to respond within 72 hours of receiving a request from any government agency; preserve data upon requests for 180 days or longer; and enable \"tracing\" the originator of the messages shared on their platforms.<br/><br/>Forcing companies to store data locally - even just copies- has been widely panned by stakeholders in India and abroad. Broadly, enforcing data localization is criticized as a regulatory tool that can lead to unchecked surveillance, impose significant costs on companies, ironically on local startups, compromise security, and as per the U.S. government be discriminatory and trade-distortive.<br/><br/>It is undeniable that the Indian government has a legitimate interest in regulating tech companies, especially given their growing strategic importance. A case can even be made that a carefully nuanced localization law - that is backed by evidence and least obstructive in practice - can be an appropriate regulatory response in some cases.<br/><br/>It is undeniable that the Indian government has a legitimate interest in regulating tech companies, especially given their growing strategic importance.<br/><br/>However, the current data localization directive is driven by the government's waning patience in eliciting compliance from tech companies across issues - from online speech to taxation. Even in the absence of a consensus across agencies on the extent, indeed the rationale behind data localization, the government is hurtling towards a point of no return. The government's frustration stems from private and foreign companies wielding public power and, consequently, opposing state sovereignty.<br/><br/>Compliance with such a law would run wildly contrary to the public stance that tech companies have long held on this issue. If passed in its current form, this law will also be counterproductive defeating the government's intended purpose, likely hurting law enforcement efforts, undermining user privacy in the process.<br/><br/>First, as I mentioned above, it is unclear whether a mandate to relocate data locally will translate into easier access for Indian law enforcement. Given that U.S. law effectively bars these companies from disclosing user data to foreign law enforcement authorities, companies are in a position to legally refuse to comply with requests. As is current practice, companies can continue to demand a judicial order from a U.S. court to comply with a request for content of any online communications.<br/><br/>Second, even if localizing data could assuage fears of foreign surveillance, it could easily lend itself to domestic surveillance. The Committee has sought to localize data for law enforcement but \"categorically refused to afford this data any procedural protection\". The Committee has instead placed the onus on Parliament to enact another comprehensive legislation for surveillance reform. In other words, the government is enacting data localization in the absence of any, let alone strong, data protection laws and enforcement mechanisms. Some have gone on to argue that the mandate may therefore not fulfill the standard laid out by the Supreme Court on what constitutes a reasonable restriction on an individual's right to privacy. This reasoning is compelling since the government can just as easily adopt less onerous regulations that could serve the purpose adequately and proportionately.<br/><br/>Competing Incentives of Tech Companies<br/><br/>Developments over the past year conclusively indicate that tech companies are relenting to Indian government demands to forcefully localize data. While these demands are not new, the RBI made a decisive move towards enacting this mandate for the first time targeting big tech companies - posing an existential peril to the payment ecosystem in the country. The principal banking regulator made it mandatory for all \"payment system providers\" to store payments data locally and ensure \"unfettered supervisory access\" to the data stored within a six-month period (Source: Reserve Bank of India Notifications, \"Storage of Payment Systems Data\", Apr. 6, 2018). Eighty percent of the players, including Google, Amazon, and Whatsapp, have reportedly either complied with the regulation or are planning to.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the RBI notification has a far-reaching impact - not only because it is the first policy of this kind, but more importantly for what it signals lies in store. It has been reported that the Central Bank is relying on the localization regulation to \"prepare ground\" for a stringent data protection law that would be applicable across sectors not limited to financial data. Further, the close involvement of the central government in seeking compliance with the RBI regulation firmly indicates the emergence of a \"whole-of-government\" approach, laying the foundation for a wider localization requirement under the upcoming data protection law.<br/><br/>Admittedly, big tech companies have complied with data localization laws in Russia and China previously. However, I argue here, that submitting to an Indian regulation (and thereby a mandate issued by a democratic state) represents a turning point in the incentives that drive their behavior in emerging economies. Take Facebook, for instance. The company recently not only acknowledged that choosing where to build data centers is \"one of the most important decisions\" they make, but also committed to not storing sensitive data in countries with weak human rights records or lacking security safeguards. Meanwhile, Facebook's subsidiary Whatsapp is on the final stretch before storing all payments-related data within India in the absence of adequate checks and balances under Indian law.<br/><br/>It may be unclear, even unnecessary, to characterize these actions of tech companies as hypocrisy or doublespeak. Tech companies have been and will continue to strike a balance between cooperation with, and resistance to lawful surveillance across jurisdictions.<br/><br/>In effect, however, the added complexity of responding to foreign governments has contributed to their resistance over time. This, in turn, has resulted in heavy-handed policies in growing markets such as India, which has distorted the incentives that earlier drove their actions. Companies are increasingly either adhering to these policies or showing a willingness to. Even while companies are incentivized by a profit motive, and understandably so, as privacy negotiators their acquiescence or pushback plays an outsized role for the privacy rights of Indian users. This alone demands an exercise in breaking down what incentives drive them.<br/><br/>Launch of new services: The launch of WhatsApp's first-ever payments service coincided with the RBI localization notification. The RBI's directive to all payment system providers to store payment data of the Indian leg of a transaction exclusively in India was issued in April 2018. In addition to the local storage requirement, the stated purpose behind the regulation was for providers to establish a mechanism to allow the Central bank to monitor this data end-to-end. The regulation was applicable to all payment providers including international card networks such as Mastercard and Visa, and operators of pre-paid wallets including WhatsApp Payments, Amazon Pay and Google Pay.<br/><br/>The consequent resistance to this regulation by global payment firms including big tech companies illustrated not only how their pushback was unsuccessful, but also the stakes involved for these companies as they were vying to expand in the Indian market. Tech companies view India as the \"next frontier of growth\" - fighting to capture the sizable and growing digital payments market, which is expected to be worth a reported $500 billion by 2020. Google Pay is reported to have 30 million users on the platform in India alone. With over 200 million monthly active users, India is the biggest market for WhatsApp - justifying why the company has been testing its payments service first in the country.<br/><br/>Even while complying with the RBI regulation heralded significant costs and an overhaul of existing operations; and is inconsistent with their previous policy positions on this issue, tech companies ultimately relented. Google, for instance, agreed to abide by all RBI requirements while at the same time maintaining that they promote cross border data flows since they generate more economic value. Apple, on the other hand, has reportedly stalled the launch of Apple Pay in India in light of RBI's localization mandate.<br/><br/>Even under mounting pressure from industry bodies, U.S.-India trade organizations and U.S. senators, the Indian government has been unwavering in its demand. The Central Bank refused to extend their six-month deadline for compliance; did not concede to a less onerous alternative such as a \"mirror server\" requirement; and did not open up to public consultation. While companies challenged the RBI directive, it is clear that none of them pursued a legal challenge, though the reasons why remain unclear. Combined with the whole of government approach that the current administration in India has adopted, we see that tech companies acceded to the localization request given their significant growing interest in the market.<br/><br/>Localization as the \"less bad\" option: Increasingly, tech companies operating in India are seen to be viewing a localization mandate as a less bad option. First, tech companies across the board have agreed to comply (some at the first instance) with the RBI notification to exclusively store payment data arising out of the country locally. The majority of the global payment firms including Amazon and Google have abided by the law and satisfied the regulator's requirements (Amazon not mirroring it abroad Whatsapp asked for 5 more months, mastercard and rest asked for one year). This differs significantly from how some of the companies have responded to Russia's 2014 data localization law, with some either ignoring the obligation altogether and the rest failing to fully comply.<br/><br/>Second, it appears increasingly unlikely that the companies would continue to rely on U.S. law as a crutch to resist or delay responding to requests from Indian agencies. In effect by complying with the RBI requirement to store data exclusively in India, the companies have ceded to the regulators' supervisory powers. Especially given the presence of physical infrastructure or personnel in the country, companies might consider the risk of not attracting punitive action more seriously.<br/><br/>Third, tech companies might be willing to acquiesce to data localization to stave off demands that could fundamentally alter their technological design. Over the past year, while WhatsApp has been under government pressure to localize data, the company was also fighting the fire to contain the spread of viral rumors on its platform. False videos of child abduction shared on the messaging app triggered a spate of mob-related killings that resulted in over 30 reported deaths.<br/><br/>The company's plan to launch its payment service stalled as they came under intense scrutiny from the government to \"not evade responsibility\" and were being pressured to introduce technology changes to their service. This pressure culminated with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)'s draft intermediary guidelines late last year that mandatorily required companies to enable \"tracing out the originator\" of messages upon requests and to respond within 72 hours. While the company made changes to its messaging service to limit forwarding of messages, they pushed back on the tracing requirement as it could entail breaking the end-to-end encryption deployed by the platform. We see that while the company was willing to alter its architecture by storing data locally for its payment service, they were at the same time unwilling to alter a critical facet of its business model in encryption.</p><p>Responsibility of Tech Companies as Privacy Negotiators<br/><br/>U.S. tech companies operating in India are therefore caught up in what can best be termed as an identity crisis. At the crux of it, the aforementioned incentives muddy the waters for tech companies, making it difficult for them to push for a workaround to adequately address the challenge of Indian law enforcement access to data.<br/><br/>Since U.S. tech companies play a unique role when responding to government surveillance, acting both as the first and last line of defense, I argue that only companies can and must negotiate to protect the long-term privacy interests of Indian users. Especially given that these tech companies will soon be recognized as \"data fiduciaries\" in the Indian market, I argue that companies indeed have an additional legal responsibility to protect their users' privacy interests. Through the CLOUD Act, tech companies can counteract the demands for data localization while upholding high standards of due process and privacy protections for Indian users that are currently unavailable under Indian law.<br/><br/>As current literature has exhaustively outlined, tech companies are the only actors privy to the nature of requests they receive from government agencies. Not only can tech companies afford the resources to comply with requests, but they can also cooperate more actively, and even pushback through a legal challenge when required. Ultimately it is only companies who have the resources or the legal standing to fight a request - further entrenching the role that they play as privacy negotiators.<br/><br/>The question that then arises is what role do companies discharge as privacy negotiators? Are there any obligations, legal or otherwise, on these companies to safeguard user rights within the larger surveillance architecture?<br/><br/>To predict the route that technology companies will adopt in the tussle between advocating for user privacy and acceding to lawful surveillance, it is necessary to distill the specific interests that tech companies have in going either way. Viewed as pure corporate actors following rational self-interest, it may seem unwise for the companies to assume any additional burden of resisting requests for access to data, even when requests may be overbroad or vague. This holds doubly true when American companies undertake the collective responsibility of addressing requests from foreign governments and are called on to find a fix to the current overburdened cross-border regime for data sharing.<br/><br/>Largely, the current scholarship falls on one of two sides of this debate. The first, popularized by Rozenshtein, adopts an empathetic view that companies as surveillance intermediaries have brought about an overall positive change or \"disciplining effect\" on the surveillance regime-through pushback in courts and mobilizing public opinion for the benefit of user privacy. Rozenshtein goes so far as to argue that tech companies have never before relied so significantly on a foreign user base and resisted government surveillance this aggressively in part due to their \"intense libertarian aversion to government invasions of privacy.\"<br/><br/>The second is more cynical in its outlook where scholars argue that tech companies shielding or delivering information to law enforcement is all happenstance and purely an outcome of their pervasiveness in our digital economy. Users should have no expectations to think a \"technology company can and should be responsible for its users' rights.\" Regardless, the consensus across the two schools is loud and clear. Tech companies post 2013 Snowden disclosures have a commercial incentive to challenge lawful government surveillance and advocate for users rights; and indeed on the whole until now, companies' actions support this contention.<br/><br/>However, this contention overall no longer holds any water. As I have outlined above, the incentives of tech companies are no longer aligned with the interests of users - at least Indian users. By conceding, indeed, complying with the Indian government's mandate to store data locally in the absence of adequate privacy safeguards, tech companies' interests have conclusively aligned with the government and regulatory interests and no longer appear aligned with those of Indian users; and by extension users in all emerging markets. The incentive to launch a new service in a crucial market or the act of conceding to localization in order to not attract other adverse regulatory mandates are compelling reasons for companies to abandon their seemingly voluntary role as privacy negotiators. Instead, the assertion that companies often choose to fight for user privacy because of their profit motives and not in spite of them-as advanced by the above mentioned cynical school-does a better job of explaining the turn of events helmed by tech companies in the country. Simply put, tech companies find themselves in a conflict of interests-advancing their market priorities versus prioritizing user privacy.<br/><br/>This relationship between tech companies and users stands fundamentally altered with the growing recognition of tech companies as fiduciaries. India's upcoming draft data protection bill may well be one of the first few legislations that articulates this duty of care for tech companies - recognizing any individual, state, company, or juristic entity who determines the purposes and means of processing personal data (either alone or in conjunction with others) as data fiduciaries.<br/><br/>The constitutional law scholar Jack Balkin first proposed extending the common law doctrine of fiduciary relationships to the digital economy - and coined the term \"information fiduciaries\" (Source: Jack M. Balkin, \"Information fiduciaries and the first amendment.\" UCDL Rev. 49 ,1183, 2015). This proposal has gained wide acceptance, with the drafters of India's data protection bill adapting it to develop a \"fourth path\" to deliver a data protection regime, distinct from the U.S., EU and China - relevant not just to India but to \"all countries in the Global South\".<br/><br/>As information fiduciaries, tech companies including social media, search engines, etc. will have to discharge duties of care, confidentiality and loyalty towards users whose data they collect, store and use (Source: Jack M. Balkin, \"Information fiduciaries and the first amendment.\" UCDL Rev. 49 ,1183, 2015). This fiduciary responsibility bestowed on companies is over and above the contractual rights that users are entitled to and further confers the duty on companies to adopt a professional code of ethics to protect the data principal's or user's interests. Balkin likens this duty to that of a doctor's or lawyer's:<br/><br/>Suppose that a doctor, lawyer, or accountant sold personal information about their clients to a data broker. Suppose that they used personal information to manipulate a client's actions for the doctor, lawyer, or accountant's benefit. Or suppose that they simply disclosed it in order to gain a business advantage at the expense of their client. If they did any of these things, they would likely be liable for a violation of professional conduct  Even absent an express promise not to reveal, use or sell information, there is a duty not to do so in ways that will harm the interests of the client, or that pose a conflict of interest.<br/><br/>The fiduciary relationship between users and companies, however, is not extended to all online service providers who operate in the digital economy. Instead, four criteria must be met for a company to be considered an information fiduciary; whether users are placed in a position of significant vulnerability, whether users disclose personal information to the company in return for gaining access to important online services; and finally whether the company holds disproportionate volumes of data about the user which can be used against her interest (Source: Jack M. Balkin, \"Information fiduciaries and the first amendment.\" UCDL Rev. 49 ,1183, 2015, and Jack M.Balkin, \"Fixing Social Media's Grand Bargain.\" Hoover Working Group on National Security, Technology, and Law, Aegis Series Paper 1814,2018.) Admittedly, India's draft data protection bill adopts a broader sanction, indeed conferring the fiduciary duty on all actors who process personal data in the digital market.<br/><br/>The criteria set out above, however, are wholly met by private tech firms in the current surveillance ecosystem for the reasons I stated above - that tech companies are the first and last line of defense. While the above excerpt suggests that tech companies must be able to avoid conflicts that harm the interests of clients, or in this case users, altogether - the reality is not as wishful. Instead, with the statutory recognition of their fiduciary duty, tech firms have an obligation to carry out their duty of loyalty by resolving any conflict of interest to the benefit of their users' interests and not their own. Therefore, as privacy negotiators, tech companies must respond to surveillance by not endangering the privacy of their users by localizing data in the absence of adequate safeguards, but instead work towards a sustainable workaround. Commentators have argued that the government's push towards data localization in the data protection bill (and companies acceding to this demand) undermines the fiduciary relationship laid out in the very same bill - increasing not just privacy but the security risks of users located in India.<br/><br/>Indeed, the duty of loyalty translates into fiduciaries ensuring that they use data \"only in ways that are consistent with users' expectations.\" (Source: Ariel Dobkin, \"Information Fiduciaries in Practice: Data Privacy and User Expectations.\" Berkeley Tech. LJ 33 2018: 1.) Expectations of Indian users can be easily traced in the submissions to MeitY during the recent public consultation process on the data protection bill. Not only has a significant section of civil society and industry opposed the localization mandate but there is also a growing consensus that an India-U.S. agreement under the CLOUD Act must be considered as a policy alternative. Therefore, as privacy negotiators bestowed with a fiduciary duty, tech companies must strive to leverage their clout to push for such an agreement.</p><p>Resolving Conflicts<br/><br/>The whole-of-government approach adopted by Indian policymakers combined with the support from the law enforcement and national security community has all but cemented the government's single-minded objective of demanding U.S. companies to store personal data locally. This move cannot be seen in isolation - only stemming from the challenge that the Indian government currently faces either in accessing user data or enforcing domestic regulations. The government recognizing that data is a \"strategic asset\" is motivated to level the playing field between Indian and foreign players in the digital economy; even appointing industry representatives with reported conflicting interests to policy drafting committees. While there is acknowledgement that localization is not a silver-bullet solution for all of these multifarious concerns, law enforcement access is viewed as the only challenge that will definitively be solved by localizing data within Indian borders. With the lines between global tech companies and their Indian counterparts drawn, Indian companies have thrown their support behind localization; expecting that it will give them a competitive advantage against the outsized resources that the technology giants command.<br/><br/>Other developments over the past year have also contributed to a confrontation between foreign tech companies and the Indian government. The reveal, for instance that the Cambridge Analytica leaks had led to sharing of personal information of 560,000 Indians with the political consulting firm. And more recently, Twitter initially declining to appear before the parliamentary standing committee on information technology.<br/><br/>From the perspective of the users, however, there is a dawning realization that critical safeguards for privacy may be lost in this battle for compliance between the government and companies. Especially in the surveillance regime it is ultimately only companies that may have a legal standing to resist requests for excessive collection of user data - further cementing the role that they can play as privacy negotiators. In effect, global technology companies wield significant bargaining clout that,at least until now,as been used sparingly when user privacy has coincided with their commercial interests. On the face of it,that seems to be changing.<br/><br/>Major U.S. tech companies have openly supported President Trump's signing of the CLOUD Act. Microsoft, for instance, has committed to additional privacy protections on top of the CLOUD Act including the requirement for prior-judicial sanction before responding to request. Apple is contributing to making the process more transparent by training law enforcement officials from around the world in lawful data collection and by creating a web portal for requesting user data and tracking the status of these requests. More recently, Amazon Web Services joined the list of prominent technology companies that have lent support to the CLOUD Act as the answer to data collection for law enforcement.<br/><br/>This support is not insignificant. With their sheer size, near complete integration with the digital economy and transnational operations, the companies have begun to resemble nation states in multilateral negotiations and as such will have a huge bearing on whether the new framework succeeds or fails.<br/><br/>However, as I have examined in Part II of the article, even as companies openly voice support for frameworks such as the CLOUD Act, their actions in response to regulatory pressure in India suggest otherwise. A critical consideration in this equation, however, is users' trust in the companies' ability to protect their data and privacy. This trust is not limitless and for it to persist, companies will need to walk the talk of safeguarding user privacy.<br/><br/>Frameworks like the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, signed by over 100 global companies committed to protecting users against malicious cyber threats (even those emanating from state actors), are symbolic of the clout that global tech companies can leverage - an initiative that need to be encouraged in conversations around law enforcement access to data.</p><p>Conclusion<br/><br/>Law enforcement demands for access to data have coincided and intensified with the evolution of electronic communications. And yet, the contours of this access are more fluid today than they have ever been and will only get murkier in the coming years. Two paradoxical trends in technology lend credence to this fact: even as larger and more complex data sets become available, a pivot towards anonymising technologies is likely to make more and more data inaccessible to law enforcement.<br/><br/>Law enforcement demands for access to data have coincided and intensified with the evolution of electronic communications.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, Facebook - arguably the most important arbiter of user privacy - announced the eventual merging of its three messaging services and the creation of an ecosystem where the chat app essentially becomes a web browser. The more significant part of the announcement, however, was the deployment of WhatsApp-like encryption across all its services. The company would store no content data and would therefore not be in a position to share it with law enforcement. This pivot towards universal encryption is likely to intensify the present demands for data access and a resurgence of the dichotomous debate around user privacy versus national security.<br/><br/>At the same time, as emerging technologies like facial recognition, wearables, and smart assistants become commonplace, they will create highly sophisticated datasets including behavioral data - compounding both the volume and types of data that can be available for criminal investigations.<br/><br/>While encryption will further frustrate law enforcement attempts to access data, new and emerging datasets will increase their dependence on technology platforms. Reconciling these two demands will need fixing the problems that currently plague cross-border data sharing. An important realization that has emerged in the context of controversies surrounding content moderation and speech regulation by social media platforms has been that centralization of these complex politico-legal decisions in the hands of a few actors.<br/><br/>Competing priorities around ensuring national security, investigating crimes and protecting user privacy have long evaded any meaningful reconciliation. In many ways, recent developments like India's data localization mandate have forced technology companies and privacy advocates into a corner. At the same time, new policy frameworks like the CLOUD Act have, for the first time, thrown up an opportunity to arrive at a sustainable and privacy-strengthening solution.<br/><br/>The pivot that technology companies make in their public policy posture now will determine the way in which this debate will be resolved. It is critical that they step up and not only bargain for stronger user protection, but also highlight to countries like India how a cooperative and not compulsive framework will better serve all stakeholders in the long run.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>Madhulika Srikumar is attending the graduate program at Harvard Law School as a 2019 Inlaks Scholar.

This is exactly what happened to several unsuspecting Australians last month, when the website Insecam streamed their personal lives online.                     According to an ABC report , Insecam broadcasts live streams of dozens of Australian businesses and homes at any given time. Some cameras can be accessed because owners don\u2019t secure them. Some may be hacked into despite being \u201csecured\u201d.   When asked if they care about their personal information being shared online, most people say they do. A 2017 survey found 69% of Australians were more concerned about their online privacy than in 2012.   However, a much smaller percentage of people actually take the necessary actions to preserve their privacy. This is referred to as the \u201cprivacy paradox\u201d, a concept first studied about two decades ago.   To investigate this phenomenon further, we conducted a research project and found that, despite being concerned about privacy, participants were willing to sacrifice some of it in exchange for the convenience afforded by an internet-connected device.  Unpacking the privacy paradox      Any \u201csmart\u201d device connected to the internet is called an Internet of Things (IoT) device. These can be remotely monitored and controlled by the owners.   The projected growth of IoT devices is staggering. By 2025, they\u2019re expected to reach 75.44 billion \u2013 an increase of 146% from 2020.    The global IoT network is a collection of all the interconnected devices that can communicate online. This includes smart devices, appliances and wearable tech.   Shutterstock    Are device owners genuinely concerned about their privacy ? Recent worldwide anxiety about personal information shared through COVID-19 tracing apps seems to suggest so.   But as the privacy paradox highlights, users expressing privacy concerns often fail to act in accordance with them. They freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience.   Explanations for the privacy paradox abound. Some suggest:   people find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it  people do not consider their personal information to be their own and thus might not appreciate the need to secure it  people completely lack awareness of their right to privacy or privacy issues and believe their desired goals (such as a personalised experience) outweigh the potential risks (such as big tech companies using their data for profiling).   The likely explanation for the privacy paradox is a mix of all these factors.  What if we proved your device harvests data?      To understand whether and how the privacy paradox applies to IoT devices, we conducted an experiment involving 46 Saudi Arabian participants. This is because in Saudi Arabia the use of IoT is exploding and the country does not have strong privacy regulations.   We gave participants a smart plug that let them switch a table lamp on or off using an app on their smartphone. We then showed them the device\u2019s privacy policy and measured participants\u2019 privacy concerns and trust in the device.   None of the participants read the privacy policy. They simply agreed to commence with the study.   After two hours, we presented evidence of how much of their data the IoT-connected plug was harvesting, then remeasured their privacy concerns and trust.   After the participants saw evidence of privacy violation, their privacy concerns increased and trust in the device decreased. However their behaviour did not align with their concern, as shown by the fact that:   15 participants continued to use the device regardless  13 continued to use it with their personal information removed  only three opted to block all outbound traffic to unusual IP addresses.   The rest preferred \u201clight-touch\u201d responses, such as complaining on social media, complaining to the device\u2019s manufacturer or falsifying their shared information.   After one month, we measured participants\u2019 attitudes a third time and discovered their privacy concerns and trust in the device had reverted to pre-experiment levels.  How to prevent complacency      Two decades since the first privacy paradox studies were conducted and despite a great deal of research , there is still a mismatch between people\u2019s stated privacy concerns and their protective behaviours. How can we improve this?    Every time you connect a new device to the internet, or opt-in to a new service, ask yourself: \u2018do I really need this?\u2019   Shutterstock    The first step is to simply be aware our judgement of IoT device risks and benefits may not be accurate. With that in mind, we should always take time to read the privacy policies of our devices.   Besides informing us of the risks, reading privacy policies can help us stop and think before connecting a new device to the internet. Ask yourself: \u201cis this really going to benefit me?\u201d   As citizen surveillance increases, it\u2019s not wise to mindlessly scroll through privacy policies, tick a box and move on.   Second, we should not assume our personal information is trivial and would not interest anyone. Time after time we have witnessed how our digital traces can be valuable to malicious individuals or large corporations.   And finally, always change the default password on any new IoT device to a stronger one .

This is exactly what happened to several unsuspecting Australians last month, when the website Insecam streamed their personal lives online.                      According to an ABC report , Insecam broadcasts live streams of dozens of Australian businesses and homes at any given time. Some cameras can be accessed because owners don\u2019t secure them. Some may be hacked into despite being \u201csecured\u201d.    When asked if they care about their personal information being shared online, most people say they do. A 2017 survey found 69% of Australians were more concerned about their online privacy than in 2012.    However, a much smaller percentage of people actually take the necessary actions to preserve their privacy. This is referred to as the \u201cprivacy paradox\u201d, a concept first studied about two decades ago.    To investigate this phenomenon further, we conducted a research project and found that, despite being concerned about privacy, participants were willing to sacrifice some of it in exchange for the convenience afforded by an internet-connected device.   Unpacking the privacy paradox   Any \u201csmart\u201d device connected to the internet is called an Internet of Things (IoT) device. These can be remotely monitored and controlled by the owners.    The projected growth of IoT devices is staggering. By 2025, they\u2019re expected to reach 75.44 billion \u2013 an increase of 146% from 2020.     The global IoT network is a collection of all the interconnected devices that can communicate online. This includes smart devices, appliances and wearable tech.    Shutterstock      Are device owners genuinely concerned about their privacy ? Recent worldwide anxiety about personal information shared through COVID-19 tracing apps seems to suggest so.    But as the privacy paradox highlights, users expressing privacy concerns often fail to act in accordance with them. They freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience.    Explanations for the privacy paradox abound. Some suggest:    people find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it  people do not consider their personal information to be their own and thus might not appreciate the need to secure it  people completely lack awareness of their right to privacy or privacy issues and believe their desired goals (such as a personalised experience) outweigh the potential risks (such as big tech companies using their data for profiling).    The likely explanation for the privacy paradox is a mix of all these factors.   What if we proved your device harvests data?   To understand whether and how the privacy paradox applies to IoT devices, we conducted an experiment involving 46 Saudi Arabian participants. This is because in Saudi Arabia the use of IoT is exploding and the country does not have strong privacy regulations.    We gave participants a smart plug that let them switch a table lamp on or off using an app on their smartphone. We then showed them the device\u2019s privacy policy and measured participants\u2019 privacy concerns and trust in the device.    None of the participants read the privacy policy. They simply agreed to commence with the study.    After two hours, we presented evidence of how much of their data the IoT-connected plug was harvesting, then remeasured their privacy concerns and trust.    After the participants saw evidence of privacy violation, their privacy concerns increased and trust in the device decreased. However their behaviour did not align with their concern, as shown by the fact that:    15 participants continued to use the device regardless  13 continued to use it with their personal information removed  only three opted to block all outbound traffic to unusual IP addresses.    The rest preferred \u201clight-touch\u201d responses, such as complaining on social media, complaining to the device\u2019s manufacturer or falsifying their shared information.    After one month, we measured participants\u2019 attitudes a third time and discovered their privacy concerns and trust in the device had reverted to pre-experiment levels.   How to prevent complacency   Two decades since the first privacy paradox studies were conducted and despite a great deal of research , there is still a mismatch between people\u2019s stated privacy concerns and their protective behaviours. How can we improve this?     Every time you connect a new device to the internet, or opt-in to a new service, ask yourself: \u2018do I really need this?\u2019    Shutterstock      The first step is to simply be aware our judgement of IoT device risks and benefits may not be accurate. With that in mind, we should always take time to read the privacy policies of our devices.    Besides informing us of the risks, reading privacy policies can help us stop and think before connecting a new device to the internet. Ask yourself: \u201cis this really going to benefit me?\u201d    As citizen surveillance increases, it\u2019s not wise to mindlessly scroll through privacy policies, tick a box and move on.    Second, we should not assume our personal information is trivial and would not interest anyone. Time after time we have witnessed how our digital traces can be valuable to malicious individuals or large corporations.    And finally, always change the default password on any new IoT device to a stronger one . Write down this password and secure it, perhaps with other physical valuables, so you don\u2019t have to worry about forgetting it.

This is exactly what happened to several unsuspecting Australians last month, when the website Insecam streamed their personal lives online. According to an ABC report , Insecam broadcasts live streams of dozens of Australian businesses and homes at any given time. Some cameras can be accessed because owners don''t secure them. </p><p>Some may be hacked into despite being ''secured''.When asked if they care about their personal information being shared online, most people say they do. A 2017 survey found 69% of Australians were more concerned about their online privacy than in 2012. However, a much smaller percentage of people actually take the necessary actions to preserve their privacy. This is referred to as the ''privacy paradox'', a concept first studied about two decades ago.To investigate this phenomenon further, we conducted a research project and found that, despite being concerned about privacy, participants were willing to sacrifice some of it in exchange for the convenience afforded by an internet-connected device. Unpacking the privacy paradoxAny ''smart'' device connected to the internet is called an Internet of Things (IoT) device. These can be remotely monitored and controlled by the owners.The projected growth of IoT devices is staggering. By 2025, they''re expected to reach 75.44 billion - an increase of 146% from 2020.<br/>The global IoT network is a collection of all the interconnected devices that can communicate online. This includes smart devices, appliances and wearable tech. Shutterstock Are device owners genuinely concerned about their privacy ? Recent worldwide anxiety about personal information shared through COVID-19 tracing apps seems to suggest so. But as the privacy paradox highlights, users expressing privacy concerns often fail to act in accordance with them. They freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience.Explanations for the privacy paradox abound. Some suggest:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>people find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>people do not consider their personal information to be their own and thus might not appreciate the need to secure it</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>people completely lack awareness of their right to privacy or privacy issues and believe their desired goals (such as a personalised experience) outweigh the potential risks (such as big tech companies using their data for profiling).</p></bodyText></listItem></list>The likely explanation for the privacy paradox is a mix of all these factors. Read more: How Facebook uses the ''privacy paradox'' to keep users sharing What if we proved your device harvests data?To understand whether and how the privacy paradox applies to IoT devices, we conducted an experiment involving 46 Saudi Arabian participants. This is because in Saudi Arabia the use of IoT is exploding and the country does not have strong privacy regulations. We gave participants a smart plug that let them switch a table lamp on or off using an app on their smartphone. We then showed them the device''s privacy policy and measured participants'' privacy concerns and trust in the device. None of the participants read the privacy policy. They simply agreed to commence with the study.After two hours, we presented evidence of how much of their data the IoT-connected plug was harvesting, then remeasured their privacy concerns and trust. After the participants saw evidence of privacy violation, their privacy concerns increased and trust in the device decreased. However their behaviour did not align with their concern, as shown by the fact that:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>15 participants continued to use the device regardless</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>13 continued to use it with their personal information removed</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>only three opted to block all outbound traffic to unusual IP addresses.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>The rest preferred ''light-touch'' responses, such as complaining on social media, complaining to the device''s manufacturer or falsifying their shared information.After one month, we measured participants'' attitudes a third time and discovered their privacy concerns and trust in the device had reverted to pre-experiment levels.How to prevent complacencyTwo decades since the first privacy paradox studies were conducted and despite a great deal of research , there is still a mismatch between people''s stated privacy concerns and their protective behaviours. How can we improve this?<br/>Every time you connect a new device to the internet, or opt-in to a new service, ask yourself: ''do I really need this?'' Shutterstock The first step is to simply be aware our judgement of IoT device risks and benefits may not be accurate. With that in mind, we should always take time to read the privacy policies of our devices.Besides informing us of the risks, reading privacy policies can help us stop and think before connecting a new device to the internet. Ask yourself: ''is this really going to benefit me?'' As citizen surveillance increases, it''s not wise to mindlessly scroll through privacy policies, tick a box and move on.

But calling it out is easier than fixing it Second, we should not assume our personal information is trivial and would not interest anyone. Time after time we have witnessed how our digital traces can be valuable to malicious individuals or large corporations. And finally, always change the default password on any new IoT device to a stronger one . Write down this password and secure it, perhaps with other physical valuables, so you don''t have to worry about forgetting it.<br/>MENAFN297202000019911046ID1100558982</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MENENG-1100558982</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MENENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-RC51-F04Y-T4B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300954</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MENA English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38985\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is exactly what happened to several unsuspecting Australians last month, when the website Insecam streamed their personal lives online.    According to an ABC report , Insecam broadcasts live streams of dozens of Australian businesses and homes at any given time. Some cameras can be accessed because owners don\u2019t secure them. Some may be hacked into despite being \u201csecured\u201d.    When asked if they care about their personal information being shared online, most people say they do. A 2017 survey found 69% of Australians were more concerned about their online privacy than in 2012.    However, a much smaller percentage of people actually take the necessary actions to preserve their privacy. This is referred to as the \u201cprivacy paradox\u201d, a concept first studied about two decades ago.    To investigate this phenomenon further, we conducted a research project and found that, despite being concerned about privacy, participants were willing to sacrifice some of it in exchange for the convenience afforded by an internet-connected device.   Unpacking the privacy paradox   Any \u201csmart\u201d device connected to the internet is called an Internet of Things (IoT) device. These can be remotely monitored and controlled by the owners.    The projected growth of IoT devices is staggering. By 2025, they\u2019re expected to reach 75.44 billion \u2013 an increase of 146% from 2020.         Are device owners genuinely concerned about their privacy ? Recent worldwide anxiety about personal information shared through COVID-19 tracing apps seems to suggest so.    But as the privacy paradox highlights, users expressing privacy concerns often fail to act in accordance with them. They freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience.    Explanations for the privacy paradox abound. Some suggest:    people find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it  people do not consider their personal information to be their own and thus might not appreciate the need to secure it  people completely lack awareness of their right to privacy or privacy issues and believe their desired goals (such as a personalised experience) outweigh the potential risks (such as big tech companies using their data for profiling).    The likely explanation for the privacy paradox is a mix of all these factors.     What if we proved your device harvests data?   To understand whether and how the privacy paradox applies to IoT devices, we conducted an experiment involving 46 Saudi Arabian participants. This is because in Saudi Arabia the use of IoT is exploding and the country does not have strong privacy regulations.    We gave participants a smart plug that let them switch a table lamp on or off using an app on their smartphone. We then showed them the device\u2019s privacy policy and measured participants\u2019 privacy concerns and trust in the device.    None of the participants read the privacy policy. They simply agreed to commence with the study.    After two hours, we presented evidence of how much of their data the IoT-connected plug was harvesting, then remeasured their privacy concerns and trust.    After the participants saw evidence of privacy violation, their privacy concerns increased and trust in the device decreased. However their behaviour did not align with their concern, as shown by the fact that:    15 participants continued to use the device regardless  13 continued to use it with their personal information removed  only three opted to block all outbound traffic to unusual IP addresses.    The rest preferred \u201clight-touch\u201d responses, such as complaining on social media, complaining to the device\u2019s manufacturer or falsifying their shared information.    After one month, we measured participants\u2019 attitudes a third time and discovered their privacy concerns and trust in the device had reverted to pre-experiment levels.   How to prevent complacency   Two decades since the first privacy paradox studies were conducted and despite a great deal of research , there is still a mismatch between people\u2019s stated privacy concerns and their protective behaviours. How can we improve this?         The first step is to simply be aware our judgement of IoT device risks and benefits may not be accurate. With that in mind, we should always take time to read the privacy policies of our devices.    Besides informing us of the risks, reading privacy policies can help us stop and think before connecting a new device to the internet. Ask yourself: \u201cis this really going to benefit me?\u201d    As citizen surveillance increases, it\u2019s not wise to mindlessly scroll through privacy policies, tick a box and move on.      Second, we should not assume our personal information is trivial and would not interest anyone. Time after time we have witnessed how our digital traces can be valuable to malicious individuals or large corporations.    And finally, always change the default password on any new IoT device to a stronger one . Write down this password and secure it, perhaps with other physical valuables, so you don\u2019t have to worry about forgetting it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42709373587</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-58H1-F07F-82SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Conversation AU</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Black Stallion Oil &amp;

The stand-ins, according to Waldman, include privacy policies, impact assessments, trainings, audits and paper trails. </p><p>\"These things have all the trappings of systems but instead are really just window dressing,\" he says.In surveys and interviews with privacy professionals, Waldman turned up a check-the-boxes approach to privacy. What's happening: As privacy laws in Europe and California kick in, companies are setting up new internal structures to comply with them, says Dominique Shelton Leipzig, a privacy attorney at Perkins Coie.The other side: \"To conclude that assessments aren't working, I think, is a false conclusion,\" says Al Gidari, a longtime privacy lawyer now at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. \"Those processes work really well in companies because if they don't, people go to jail, employees get fired, companies get prosecuted,\" he tells Axios. But it's up to companies to prioritize privacy and implement effective systems.Gidari argues that internal assessments are necessary at big tech companies like Google,which he represented when it was investigated by the Federal Trade Commission in 2011[2]. It's not possible to formally audit dozens of products and services on a regular basis, he says. The bottom line: The offloading of enforcement to companies is a result of vague, toothless laws and weakened agencies like the FTC that would otherwise be in charge of enforcement. \"Procedure is not enough,\" says Waldman. Laws should require a substantive change like a ban on sharing certain data, rather than a process like assessments of whether or not the data is being dealt with correctly.And penalties should be much higher for wrongdoing, Gidari argues. When the FTC fined Facebook $5B for a privacy violation earlier this year, the company's stock went up. \"It's awfully hard to see how that alone is sufficient,\" Gidari says. \"When you have companies setting the rules, my biggest concern is that it's just going to be streamlined toward the most efficient process for them \u2014 but not necessarily the most efficient process for users or the fairest process for users,\" says Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland.Go deeper: The global shortage of privacy experts[3] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ssrn.com/abstract%3D3499913\">https://ssrn.com/abstract%3D3499913</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/03/ftc-charges-deceptive-privacy-practices-googles-rollout-its-buzz\">https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/03/ftc-charges-deceptive-privacy-practices-googles-rollout-its-buzz</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/privacy-expert-shortage-202eda9b-c8fa-4bd4-b1c1-11844812ab3e.html\">https://www.axios.com/privacy-expert-shortage-202eda9b-c8fa-4bd4-b1c1-11844812ab3e.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544157695363858675776100214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XT1-4KP1-F03R-N2S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><timeReceived>6:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0007SQI</classCode><className>PERKINS COIE LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC8111 LEGAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He is part of a growing chorus. Big tech's long honeymoon period is winding down. The European Union (EU) has been less than sanguine about tech giants' market dominance and practices for some years now. The US Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, markedly more forgiving than their European counterparts, are also divvying up competition investigations into the tech giants. Calibrating competition policy to regulate digital markets will be a tricky business. But there are opportunities here, particularly for India, where such policy is still a relatively greenfield area.</p><p>US judge Robert Bork's 1978 work, The Antitrust Paradox, redefined competition regulation. He argued for economic efficiency: regulators should protect competition and the consumer, not competitors. Focusing on the latter can prevent companies from achieving economies of scale and benefiting consumers via lower prices. This made intuitive sense. It had the added attraction of bringing economic rigour to the delicate business of regulating markets. Bork influenced multiple jurisdictions, not just the US. The EU had its own imperatives - market integration, for one - but the consumer welfare standard is foregrounded in India's Competition Act, 2002. As the Supreme Court put it in Excel Crop Care vs. CCI, \"The ultimate goal of competition policy is to enhance consumer well-being.\"</p><p>But something is lost in translation when applying the consumer welfare standard to digital markets. Products like Google's search engine or Facebook operate in zero-price markets. The user benefits are immense and obvious. And in the absence of a price, there is no quantifiable user harm by the lights of conventional competition logic. Focusing on price, however, ignores what law professor, Daniel Solove, has dubbed \"architectural harms\" - long term, non-monetary drops in consumer well-being in markets where they surrender excessive data and attention in return for a free product. A small but growing body of jurisprudence and regulatory action is beginning to recognise these costs. The Competition Commission of India, for instance, has noted that users pay an \"implicit price in form of personal data\" when accessing online platforms.</p><p>There are other architectural harms as well. Over the past decade, the world's five largest tech companies have made over 400 acquisitions globally. None have been blocked and few have had riders attached to them. This creates an unhealthy innovation dynamic. Promising startups that could be potential rivals are snapped up. Alternatively, they are run out of town as Amazon did with Quidsi. Venture capital has learnt to invest accordingly. Thus, genuine competition takes place for the most part in areas that are not dominated by a monopoly or duopoly - workplace productivity, say, or urban transportation. Such competition stands a better chance of improving consumer choice in everything from pricing models to privacy protection.</p><p>Regulators globally are starting to grapple with these issues. There have been some innovative measures. Take Germany's Bundeskartellamt. It has ruled that Facebook cannot make access conditional on users allowing it to link non-Facebook data to their accounts. When it demands consent to this loss of control of personal data, it is abusing its dominant position given the lack of social network alternatives. Other cases merely need closer scrutiny. There are clear issues with Amazon or any e-commerce site serving as a platform for sellers and also using the data thus gathered to compete with them via its own products.</p><p>Equally, there is overreach. Calls like Hughes's to break up big tech make little sense. Digital markets have unique characteristics. The network externalities that help an Uber attract more cab drivers as its user base grows, and vice versa, or the feedback loops that let Google improve its search engine the more search data it captures, mean that market concentration is inevitable. Admittedly, regulators could have taken a harder look at tech giants' acquisition spree. But post hoc attempts to remedy this would be long and not necessarily successful. It took US regulators a decade to break up AT&amp;#38;T. IBM held out for 13 years, and then the case against it was dropped. Nor would such attempts be appropriate for all tech giants. Apple is a juggernaut of vertical integration. Facebook has expanded horizontally. The others are conglomerates.</p><p>India has an advantage in some ways. The recent vintage of its competition regulation and lack of precedent mean that it has more room for manoeuvre when grappling with such thorny questions. How should pricing dynamics for multisided platforms that undercharge one side and recover costs from the other be assessed? How should relevant product markets and dominance be measured in digital markets? If information is to be considered an implicit cost that users pay for accessing \"free\" products, how much qualifies as abuse of a dominant market position?</p><p>Tech giants' abuse of market power is the symptom, not the problem. The problem is regulatory frameworks that haven't caught up with digital markets. Addressing it requires a measured approach, not blunt force solutions.</p><p>Vikram Sinha is junior fellow and head, Strategic Communication, IDFC Institute)</p><p>(This is the first in a four part series on data governance in India by the Data Governance Network).</p><p>The views expressed are personal</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Facebook can't seem to figure out how to prevent the live streaming of mass murders, another in a long list of problems for the tech giant, problems that are rankling the public and bringing the industry front and center politically. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KtCGzVEz-TI/XI6W5WIkdTI/AAAAAAABjGs/3NhssUATo18p0tiosKvbUeCLRCU9eKs-ACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-03-17%2Bat%2B10.15.31%2BAM.pngNancy\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KtCGzVEz-TI/XI6W5WIkdTI/AAAAAAABjGs/3NhssUATo18p0tiosKvbUeCLRCU9eKs-ACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-03-17%2Bat%2B10.15.31%2BAM.pngNancy</url> Scola did a piece for Politico Sunday asking how the Democrats running for president turned against tech[2]-- a big change for the party. Scola sees evidence that \"Democrats running for president see big tech companies as enemies of the progressive agenda, rather than the allies they once were. Warren's complaint last week that the social media giant 'has too much power' might have been a shock coming from a prominent Democrat just a few years ago, when Barack Obama's public appearances with CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey were typical for a party seeking to boost its appeal to tech-savvy young voters. The hard turn against the technology industry from prominent Democrats represents a major cultural change in the party-- and a real threat to Silicon Valley's political influence with liberals who may share tech workers' political sensibilities but are diverging from the industry on fundamental issues about privacy, business practices and taxes. For the industry, the danger is that the next president could espouse policies harmful to tech's bottom line, from pushing for tougher antitrust action to restricting government contracts for companies unwilling to change their ways.Klobuchar sounded the theme at the very start of her campaign, during the announcement speech in February where she stood in blowing snow in Minneapolis.'For too long the big tech companies have been telling you 'Don't worry! We've got your back!' while your identities are being stolen and your data is mined,' the Minnesota senator said.Even Cory Booker, a Stanford grad with close ties to Silicon Valley, used a recent NPR interview to lump tech in with other powerful lobbies that need to be reined in. \"We need to make sure that whether it's Silicon Valley or the pharma industry or the big ag, we need to hold people accountable for their actions,\" he said....Warren has taken the hardest line of all, calling for the federal government to shrink and split up industry giants like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. 'To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies,\" she wrote in a blog post this month.The Massachusetts senator later singled out Facebook after Politico reported that the social media company had taken down Warren campaign ads calling for its breakup. Facebook soon restored the ads, but Warren said the episode only underscored the need for \"a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor.\"Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz publicly took Warren's side in that dispute-- a rare occurrence that underscores the bipartisan populist appeal of the tech backlash. A Morning Consult/Politico poll earlier this month found that near-identical pluralities of Democrats and Republicans agreed with the statement, \"Technology companies have too much power and the federal government should step in to regulate more.\" A few days ago, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich penned an article for Salon explaining why Warren is right about busting up big tech[3]. It's all about monopolies. Did you know, for example, that: \u2022 Nearly 90% of all internet searches now go through Google. \u2022 Facebook and Google together account for 58% of all digital ads \u2022 93% of Americans get their news online-- and Facebook and Google is where many of them go for it \u2022 Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buyanything.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nji4kAvT54s/XI7ERXaQekI/AAAAAAABjHE/7sXWHqtFw2kqBdPAN6NRqOwdvkLIajCaQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-03-17%2Bat%2B3.01.47%2BPM.png\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nji4kAvT54s/XI7ERXaQekI/AAAAAAABjHE/7sXWHqtFw2kqBdPAN6NRqOwdvkLIajCaQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-03-17%2Bat%2B3.01.47%2BPM.png</url> Reich explains that \"With such size comes the power to stifle innovation. Amazon won't let any business that sells through it sell any item at a lower price anywhere else. It's even using its control over book sales to give books published by Amazon priority over rival publishers. Google uses the world's most widely used search engine to promote its own services and Google-generated content over those of competitors, like Yelp. Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram killed off two potential rivals.\" Such size also confers political power to get whatever these companies and their top executives want.Amazon-- the richest corporation in America-- paid nothing in federal taxes last year. Meanwhile, it's holding an auction to extort billions from states and cities eager to have its second headquarters.It also forced Seattle, it's home headquarters, to back down on a plan to tax big corporations like itself to pay for homeless shelters for a growing population that can't afford the sky-high rents caused in part by Amazon.Facebook withheld evidence of Russian activity on its platform far longer than previously disclosed. When the news came to light, it employed a political opposition research firm to discredit critics.Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, who holds the world's speed record for falling from one of the most admired to the most reviled people on the planet, just unveiled a plan to 'encrypt' personal information from all his platforms.The new plan is likely to give Facebook even more comprehensive data about everyone. If you believe it will better guard privacy, you don't remember Zuckerberg's last seven promises to protect privacy.Google forced the New America Foundation, an influential think tank it helped fund, to fire researchers who were urging antitrust officials to take on Google.And it's been quietly financed hundreds of university professors to write research papers justifying Google's market dominance.What to do? Some argue the tech mammoths should be regulated like utilities or common carriers, but this would put government into the impossible position of policing content and overseeing new products and services.A better alternative is to break them up. That way, information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels without a centralized platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach. And more startups could flourish.Like the robber barons of the first Gilded Age, those of the second have amassed fortunes because of their monopolies-- fortunes that give them unparalleled leverage over politicians and the economy.The combined wealth of Zuckerberg ($62.3 billion), Bezos ($131 billion), Brin ($49.8 billion) and Page ($50.8 billion) is larger than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population.A wealth tax (also proposed by Warren) would help.Some of the robber barons of the first Gilded Age were generous philanthropists, as are today's. That didn't excuse the damage they did to America.Let's be clear: Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists.In this new Gilded Age, we need to respond to them as forcefully as we did the first time around. Warren's ideas are a good start.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mqdi0nBq_Zc/XI6ZcIWW7HI/AAAAAAABjG4/wAjdYhDyHpc0_mbfDAUK3BBShlUEfJTiwCLcBGAs/s1600/warren_tech.jpg\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mqdi0nBq_Zc/XI6ZcIWW7HI/AAAAAAABjG4/wAjdYhDyHpc0_mbfDAUK3BBShlUEfJTiwCLcBGAs/s1600/warren_tech.jpg</url> As we suggested earlier, a Bernie/Warren ticket[4] would be a great idea to put up against Trump in 2020. One way Amazon, for example, has been able to exert influence over politicians is through substantial campaign contributions, substantial enough so that it's absolutely impossible to see them as anything other than bribes. Last year alone, Google and its executives poured $13,536,034 into electoral races (and that doesn't count the $27,400,000 they spent on lobbying in the last cycle). Amazon's biggest contribution-- by far-- went to the conservative-leaning With Honor Fund[5], which spent massively to elect Michael Waltz (R-FL), Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Brian Mast (R-FL), Steve Watkins (R-KS), Donald Bacon (R-NE). They spent $1,744,822 on Waltz and $863,616 on Crenshaw, so we're not talking about nominal contributions here. The only Democrats who were elected with significant help from the PAC were Jared Golden (ME), Mikie Sherrill (Blue Dog-NJ) and Gil Cisneros (New Dem-CA). Amazon was their biggest contributor-- more than all other contributor combined-- and their second biggest was the Bezos Family Foundation ($2,004,324).Amazon also gave significant money to the DCCC ($138,331), the DNC , the DSCC and the NRCC.

The hearing showed that lawmakers are beginning to understand what is and isn't important when it comes to regulating these large businesses. And it also showed an increased focus on the most important area of antitrust policy - mergers and acquisitions and whether regulators have exercised enough vigilance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, Big Tech has become ever more important to the U.S. economy and U.S. financial markets. The five biggest tech companies (the four that testified, plus Microsoft Corp.) now represent more than one-fifth of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500. Their value has only risen in the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>When a few companies get this big and dominant, it makes sense to think about how they might be using their size to unfairly control markets.</p><p>One typical defense against such allegations is that tech companies are not monopolies. Whether this is true depends on how markets are defined - for example, Google is overwhelmingly dominant among search engines, but has only about a third of digital ad revenues. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg argued that his company faces intense competition in many markets, especially from the other top tech companies.</p><p>But focusing on whether a company is a monopoly misses the point. Oligopolies, where a few big companies dominate the market, also tend to wield some degree of market power. In theory, that can allow powerful players to jack up consumer prices, underpay workers and squeeze suppliers.</p><p>In the case of Big Tech, consumer prices are generally not the issue. Services provided to consumers by Google and Facebook tend to be free, while Apple's fat margins stem mostly from consumer willingness to pay a lot for the brand value of an iPhone. Wages are a slightly bigger concern. Big Tech companies have already been caught and fined for colluding to hold down engineers' salaries, and there has been much attention paid to Amazon's warehouse low pay and unpleasant working conditions. But Big Tech ultimately doesn't employ very many people, and its proven anticompetitive activities have largely involved highly paid workers. So while Big Tech wage suppression deserves to be monitored closely, it's probably not yet a major threat to U.S. labor markets.</p><p>A bigger worry concerns suppliers. Platform companies depend on a network of third-party companies _ merchants who sell on Amazon, websites that run Google ads, app developers who sell on Apple's App Store and so on. The platforms' size potentially allows them to extract a lot of value from these smaller companies, demanding a larger share of their revenue or even creating and then favoring their own competing offerings.</p><p>In the long run, as tech publisher Tim O'Reilly has argued, big tech companies would probably ossify and ultimately lose out from cannibalizing their own third-party ecosystems, but there's always the danger that short-term profits will prove too tantalizing. Thus, it's a good thing that Congress focused some of its attention on the need to maintain fair relationships between platforms and suppliers. Ultimately, this issue will probably have to be resolved with regulation because breaking up platform companies would eventually cause new platforms to emerge and become dominant.</p><p>Another concern is the prices that online service companies charge advertisers. By some estimates, more than half of digital ad spending now goes to either Google or Facebook, with the fastest-rising competitor being Amazon. Advertisers are the true paying customers for free online services for consumers.</p><p>This is a reason that legislators are worried about platforms buying out the competition. Facebook CEO Mr. Zuckerberg admitted in the hearing that he purchased social-networking company Instagram in 2012 as a way to head off a potential competitor. There have been allegations that the company has attempted or threatened to do the same with other young social networks, telling them that if they didn't accept an offer, Facebook would launch a competing product and drive them out of existence.</p><p>Ultimately, that could raise prices for advertisers, if Facebook properties are the only way for them to reach social-media users. Those sorts of buyouts and buyout threats could also have a chilling effect on startup formation and economic dynamism because even the threat of competition from a dominant company can deter new entrants. Columbia Law School professor Timothy Wu has argued that such buyouts are illegal under current antitrust law.</p><p>So if there's any case for antitrust action against Big Tech right now, it probably has to do with the acquisition of upstart competitors. Unlike most of the issues surrounding Big Tech, which are complicated and confusing because of the way online network effects change the economics of size, concern over anticompetitive mergers that jack up prices is very old and very common.</p><p>In any case, it's a very good thing that Congress is beginning to pay more attention to the problems of industrial concentration and oligopoly in the U.S. economy. Big Tech is obviously the most well-known and popular case, but with concentration rising across most industries, these hearings will hopefully be a jumping-off point for a broader re-examination of the value of mega-mergers and huge, dominant companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Graeme Jennings/Associated Press: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks via video conference on July 29 during a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on antitrust on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-20080427689419</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HR-XV51-JC8R-3540-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"920\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 P.G.

Even then,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/15/climate-change-could-spark-sets-global-productivity-fire/\">climate change was a very real</url>, existential concern. Even then, we were told that major changes would be needed across industry and society alike if we were to stop global warming and prevent the melting of the polar ice caps.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the time, there were calls to eliminate CFCs from aerosols and focus on fixing the hole in the ozone layer. Plastic carrier bags were introduced to reduce our dependency on paper bags and as a result prevent overlogging. And only eccentrics recycled.</p><p>Fast-forward 25 years and the world is a very different place. It has become abundantly evident that there are bigger issues at play in the global climate crisis.</p><p>I would hazard a guess that very few of the conversations that took place last week at the World Economic Forum even mentioned the ozone layer - fewer still CFCs - as the great and the good of Davos escalated humanity's war on plastic.</p><p>When trying to solve problems, perspective is everything. Sometimes, however, it can be hard to see the wood for the trees.</p><p>Debates over the climate crisis <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/15/climate-change-could-spark-sets-global-productivity-fire/\">dominated the agenda at the WEF in Davos</url> last week, but the gathering also highlighted a separate global issue that we've failed to address in its full scope. Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, and Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, openly clashed on the future of the much-debated digital tax on big tech companies.</p><p>In recent years, there has been growing concern from governments that tech giants - the largest of which are US companies - are avoiding taxes in the European Union.</p><p>The latest war of words between the UK and US governments came not long after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/15/climate-change-could-spark-sets-global-productivity-fire/\">France backed down from its plans</url>to target the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google with a digital levy, having prompted the threat of retaliation from Washington in the form of import taxes on French goods.</p><p>It's more than obvious what the issue really is and why the UK is refusing to back down - even if it leads to a potential tax on UK exports to the US.</p><p>Let us be clear - this is a political power play. It's a carefully thought out approach deployed by state leaders, using the concerns over the companies' economic contributions to score political points over one another.</p><p>There is no denying that Big Tech should pay its fair share and it goes without saying that it has a lot to answer for. But that's not what is up for debate here.</p><p>There's a bigger problem staring us right in the face: Big tech companies are damaging because they hold digital monopolies that give them endless sway and power across multiple markets.</p><p>Take Facebook, for example. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/15/climate-change-could-spark-sets-global-productivity-fire/\">social media giant has already built up a portfolio of monopolies</url> - from advertising to communications - and has always looked to stay one step ahead. The flexibility of Facebook to shift focus with ease stems from its unique digital backbone with 2.8 billion users.</p><p>It has created its own technology that grants the complete control to immediately alter what it is offering its user - whether it is personal data and networking one day, or a new payment system the next.</p><p>We are living in an age where a small group of companies are fast controlling all areas of life.</p><p>The fact that the major tech players are escaping taxation is a direct result of the monopolies they hold, rather than the core problem itself. By focusing on questions of tax we are addressing the symptom, not the cause. And introducing a tech tax will not solve these challenges.</p><p>So what comes next? If digital tax only treats one symptom of a much wider systematic issue, where do we go from here?</p><p>Thankfully, we don't have to travel too far back into the past to take inspiration. It was only at the turn of the century when we last tackled an issue of similar severity, as Microsoft faced antitrust charges and regulators clamped down on its monopoly.</p><p>Back then, Microsoft was a singular force. Today,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/15/climate-change-could-spark-sets-global-productivity-fire/\">it's still a thriving business</url> but among a group of companies operating in the same monopolistic way across different digital realms.</p><p>The only way to effectively tackle this issue and keep Big Tech accountable is for governments to work together and break up the monopolies. Historically, these have grown over time - most notably Standard Oil - but these days monopolies can emerge overnight and grow at pace.</p><p>Political intervention is needed to solve this problem. Collaboration, rather than hostility, is what's necessary. Microsoft shows that it can be done, even in the digital age.</p><p>To make such systematic change happen, we need to stop stressing the issue of tax. It's only diverting us away from the bigger picture challenge we face, and each day we squabble over the levy, and tariffs that will be posed in return, the tech monopolies grow.</p><p>Big Tech firms are continuing to dominate markets without any real consequences, and it is time for it to stop.</p><p>There's no more room to politicise the issue further. Governments must see the wood for the trees, and bring to the fore the real reasons for tech businesses having too much power.</p><p>                     David Richards is the co-founder and chief executive of WANdisco                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-59790975</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y31-KFC1-JCJY-G2VF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Even then, climate change was a very real, existential concern. Even then, we were told that major changes would be needed across industry and society alike if we were to stop global warming and prevent the melting of the polar ice caps.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the time, there were calls to eliminate CFCs from aerosols and focus on fixing the hole in the ozone layer. Plastic carrier bags were introduced to reduce our dependency on paper bags and as a result prevent overlogging. And only eccentrics recycled.</p><p>Fast-forward 25 years and the world is a very different place. It has become abundantly evident that there are bigger issues at play in the global climate crisis.</p><p>I would hazard a guess that very few of the conversations that took place last week at the World Economic Forum even mentioned the ozone layer - fewer still CFCs - as the great and the good of Davos escalated humanity's war on plastic.</p><p>When trying to solve problems, perspective is everything. Sometimes, however, it can be hard to see the wood for the trees.</p><p>Debates over the climate crisis dominated the agenda at the WEF in Davos last week, but the gathering also highlighted a separate global issue that we've failed to address in its full scope. Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, and Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, openly clashed on the future of the much-debated digital tax on big tech companies.</p><p>In recent years, there has been growing concern from governments that tech giants - the largest of which are US companies - are avoiding taxes in the European Union.</p><p>The latest war of words between the UK and US governments came not long after France backed down from its plans to target the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google with a digital levy, having prompted the threat of retaliation from Washington in the form of import taxes on French goods.</p><p>It's more than obvious what the issue really is and why the UK is refusing to back down - even if it leads to a potential tax on UK exports to the US.</p><p>Let us be clear - this is a political power play. It's a carefully thought out approach deployed by state leaders, using the concerns over the companies' economic contributions to score political points over one another.</p><p>There is no denying that Big Tech should pay its fair share and it goes without saying that it has a lot to answer for. But that's not what is up for debate here.</p><p>There's a bigger problem staring us right in the face: Big tech companies are damaging because they hold digital monopolies that give them endless sway and power across multiple markets.</p><p>Take Facebook, for example. The social media giant has already built up a portfolio of monopolies - from advertising to communications - and has always looked to stay one step ahead. The flexibility of Facebook to shift focus with ease stems from its unique digital backbone with 2.8bn users. It has created its own technology that grants the complete control to immediately alter what it is offering its user - whether it is personal data and networking one day, or a new payment system the next.</p><p>We are living in an age where a small group of companies are fast controlling all areas of life.</p><p>The fact that the major tech players are escaping taxation is a direct result of the monopolies they hold, rather than the core problem itself. By focusing on questions of tax we are addressing the symptom, not the cause. And introducing a tech tax will not solve these challenges.</p><p>So what comes next? If digital tax only treats one symptom of a much wider systematic issue, where do we go from here? Thankfully, we don't have to travel too far back into the past to take inspiration. It was only at the turn of the century when we last tackled an issue of similar severity, as Microsoft faced antitrust charges and regulators clamped down on its monopoly.</p><p>Back then, Microsoft was a singular force. Today, it's still a thriving business but among a group of companies operating in the same monopolistic way across different digital realms.</p><p>The only way to effectively tackle this issue and keep Big Tech accountable is for governments to work together and break up the monopolies. Historically, these have grown over time - most notably Standard Oil - but these days monopolies can emerge overnight and grow at pace.</p><p>Political intervention is needed to solve this problem. Collaboration, rather than hostility, is what's necessary. Microsoft shows that it can be done, even in the digital age.</p><p>To make such systematic change happen, we need to stop stressing the issue of tax. It's only diverting us away from the bigger picture challenge we face, and each day we squabble over the levy, and tariffs that will be posed in return, the tech monopolies grow.</p><p>Big Tech firms are continuing to dominate markets without any real consequences, and it is time for it to stop.</p><p>There's no more room to politicise the issue further. Governments must see the wood for the trees, and bring to the fore the real reasons for tech businesses having too much power.</p><p>David Richards is the co-founder and chief executive of WANDISCO</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Steven Mnuchin, US treasury secretary, centre, and Sajid Javid, Chancellor, right, at a panel session at the WEF last week.

Time for more competition</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AMERICA used to be the land of opportunity and optimism. Now opportunity is seen as the preserve of the elite: two-thirds of Americans believe the economy is rigged in favour of vested interests. And optimism has turned to anger. Voters' fury fuels the insurgencies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders and weakens insiders like <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The campaigns have found plenty of things to blame, from free-trade deals to the recklessness of Wall Street. But one problem with American capitalism has been overlooked: a corrosive lack of competition. The naughty secret of American firms is that life at home is much easier: their returns on equity are 40% higher in the United States than they are abroad. Aggregate domestic profits are at near-record levels relative to GDP. America is meant to be a temple of free enterprise. It isn't.</p><p>High profits might be a sign of brilliant innovations or wise long-term investments, were it not for the fact that they are also suspiciously persistent. A very profitable American firm has an 80% chance of being that way ten years later. In the 1990s the odds were only about 50%. Some companies are capable of sustained excellence, but most would expect to see their profits competed away. Today, incumbents find it easier to make hay for longer (see pages 25-30). </p><p>You might think that voters would be happy that their employers are thriving. But if they are not reinvested, or spent by shareholders, high profits can dampen demand. The excess cash generated domestically by American firms beyond their investment budgets is running at $800 billion a year, or 4% of GDP. The tax system encourages them to park foreign profits abroad. Abnormally high profits can worsen inequality if they are the result of persistently high prices or depressed wages. Were America's firms to cut prices so that their profits were at historically normal levels, consumers' bills might be 2% lower. If steep earnings are not luring in new entrants, that may mean that firms are abusing monopoly positions, or using lobbying to stifle competition. The game may indeed be rigged.</p><p>One response to the age of hyper-profitability would be simply to wait. Creative destruction takes time: previous episodes of peak profits\u2014for example, in the late 1960s\u2014ended abruptly. Silicon Valley's evangelicals believe that a new era of big data, blockchains and robots is about to munch away the fat margins of corporate America. In the past six months the earnings of listed firms have dipped a little, as cheap oil has hit energy firms and a strong dollar has hurt multinationals. </p><p>Unfortunately the signs are that incumbent firms are becoming more entrenched, not less. Microsoft is making double the profits it did when antitrust regulators targeted the software firm in 2000. Our analysis of census data suggests that two-thirds of the economy's 900-odd industries have become more concentrated since 1997. A tenth of the economy is at the mercy of a handful of firms\u2014from dog food and batteries to airlines, telecoms and credit cards. A $10 trillion wave of mergers since 2008 has raised levels of concentration further. American firms involved in such deals have promised to cut costs by $150 billion or more, which would add a tenth to overall profits. Few plan to pass the gains on to consumers.</p><p>Getting bigger is not the only way to squish competitors. As the mesh of regulation has got denser since the 2007-08 financial crisis, the task of navigating bureaucratic waters has become more central to firms' success. Lobbying spending has risen by a third in the past decade, to $3 billion. A mastery of patent rules has become essential in health care and technology, America's two most profitable industries. And new regulations do not just fence big banks in: they keep rivals out. </p><p>Having limited working capital and fewer resources, small companies struggle with all the forms, lobbying and red tape. This is one reason why the rate of small-company creation in America has been running at its lowest levels since the 1970s. The ability of large firms to enter new markets and take on lazy incumbents has been muted by an orthodoxy among institutional investors that companies should focus on one activity and keep margins high. Warren Buffett, an investor, says he likes companies with \"moats\" that protect them from competition. America Inc has dug a giant defensive ditch around itself. </p><p>Most of the remedies dangled by politicians to solve America's economic woes would make things worse. Higher taxes would deter investment. Jumps in minimum wages would discourage hiring. Protectionism would give yet more shelter to dominant firms. Better to unleash a wave of competition. </p><p>The first step is to take aim at cosseted incumbents. Modernising the antitrust apparatus would help. Mergers that lead to high market share and too much pricing power still need to be policed. But firms can extract rents in many ways. Copyright and patent laws should be loosened to prevent incumbents milking old discoveries. Big tech platforms such as Google and Facebook need to be watched closely: they might not be rent-extracting monopolies yet, but investors value them as if they will be one day. The role of giant fund managers with crossholdings in rival firms needs careful examination, too.</p><p>The second step is to make life easier for startups and small firms. Concerns about the expansion of red tape and of the regulatory state must be recognised as a problem, not dismissed as the mad rambling of anti-government Tea Partiers. The burden placed on small firms by laws like Obamacare has been material. The rules shackling banks have led them to cut back on serving less profitable smaller customers. The pernicious spread of occupational licensing has stifled startups. Some 29% of professions, including hairstylists and most medical workers, require permits, up from 5% in the 1950s.</p><p>A blast of competition would mean more disruption for some: firms in the S&amp;P 500 employ about one in ten Americans. But it would create new jobs, encourage more investment and help lower prices. Above all, it would bring about a fairer kind of capitalism. That would lift Americans' spirits as well as their economy.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-K95OF4M</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JCG-K0W1-DY2R-20DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

There are lots of educational apps for babies, but in the end, the results are counter-productive,\" she added.</p><p> Studies show that \"children over-exposed to them are the ones who find it hardest at school\", she noted.</p><p>France banned its broadcasters from targeting under-threes in 2008 and blocked Fox-owned BabyTV from launching there.</p><p> But some programme-makers insist that bans do not work, especially with so many parents using television and devices to \"babysit\" their children.</p><p> \"It is admirable, but probably unrealistic to try to keep small children away from screens,\" said Ms Alice Webb, who heads the BBC's children's arm, CBBC, and the CBeebies network for pre-school children.</p><p> \"Digital is everywhere. This is a tide you cannot get ahead of,\" she told top television executives at the MIPJunior gathering at Cannes recently.</p><p> That said, the British public broadcaster is so worried about the digital \"Wild, Wild West\" children are growing up in that it is holding a global summit next month to try to put heads together on how they might be better served and protected.</p><p> \"We need to have this conversation now because we don't want to be saying to ourselves in 10 years' time, 'What did we do to our children''\" Ms Webb said.</p><p> She added that the BBC aimed CBeebies at children from age two, \"but we know children younger than that are watching.

Readers could learn how municipal governments are deploying sophisticated technology to ease the flow of local traffic, link residents with city hall, police communities better, and regulate energy use. Soon, some stories predicted, governments will use data\u2014gathered through sensors installed in sidewalks and other spaces\u2014to anticipate, say, where a fire might start or which crucial city systems might fail. Data-driven cities could help fight climate change, cut poverty, reduce sprawl, and even end American\u2019s love affair with the car, the press enthused. Most of the stories focused on existing cities getting smarter, but a few depicted new high-tech metropolises rising from the ground in countries like South Korea or praised the plans of visionaries like Bill Gates to wire American communities in ways that will transform how we live.</p><p>Among the glowing futuristic predictions, though, a few reports struck a cautionary note, troubled by the prospect of government, in tandem with technology contractors, gathering vast data from intimate observation of city dwellers\u2014even if for worthy goals. Further, though cities have engaged in planning for thousands of years, most of the world\u2019s great metropolises have largely grown organically, neighborhood by neighborhood. By contrast, the smart-city movement\u2014marrying the ambitions of government planners with the know-how of a new generation of disruptive tech firms\u2014seems intent on redesigning urban life from the top down. So far, the real-world results have been unimpressive, at best, with the handful of existing smart cities across the globe having difficulty luring residents, who seem repelled by their alienating coldness.</p><p>In a short time, the \u201csmart city\u201d has evolved from simple proposals to help municipal leaders operate more efficiently to an overarching vision of what kinds of communities people should live in, and even how those people should live. The typical urbanite might find himself asking: What can smart cities actually do for me\u2014or to me?</p><p>The smart-cities push grew out of the \u201csmart-growth\u201d urban movement of the 1990s, which argued for planning urban expansion around transit, mixed-use development, and walkable, densely populated neighborhoods. Gradually, the terminology shifted as tech giants like IBM and Cisco began touting their data-crunching abilities to government officials. In 2008, for instance, IBM debuted its Smarter Planet initiative, promoting the idea that, in an ever more interconnected world, information would be essential to managing communities. Out of that project emerged an effort aimed at municipalities, dubbed \u201csmarter cities.\u201d The company drew worldwide attention in 2010, when it built a comprehensive operations center for Rio de Janeiro, integrating data from 30 government agencies. An IBM marketing push then began to popularize the notion of cities getting \u201csmart.\u201d</p><p>Rapid technological advances have expanded expectations of just how intelligent cities can get. In particular, the rise of the Internet of Things\u2014a network of sensors and other intelligent devices embedded in homes and public spaces, connected with central computer systems\u2014has massively boosted the speed and scale of information-gathering. Governments can now put sensors in streetlights to observe traffic, enabling officials to make swift decisions about adjusting its ebb and flow. Sensors on streetcars and buses can warn officials about congested intersections or where illegally parked cars clog streets. Strategically placed electronics can detect gunshots, monitor noise and air quality, and may eventually guide autonomous vehicles through city streets and into available parking. (See \u201cHow Far Can Driverless Cars Take Us?\u201d)</p><p>American cities are ramping up their tech. A recent National League of Cities survey found that two-thirds of local governments have invested in technologies such as intelligent traffic signals, public WiFi kiosks, and e-governance applications that let citizens go online to register complaints, apply for permits, and reserve parking spaces. The Department of Transportation tried to nudge the smart-city idea along when it asked cities to come up with ways to combine technology, data, and transit to move people and goods more efficiently. More than six dozen cities entered the competition. In early 2017, DOT awarded first prize\u2014$40 million in federal grants\u2014to Columbus, Ohio, for proposals that include installing electric self-driving shuttles to connect transit stations to retail districts and outfitting streetlights with sensors that light up an area at night when pedestrians come passing through. Other cities advanced similar initiatives\u2014Pittsburgh proposed connecting a residential neighborhood to downtown with a 30-mile loop traversed by self-driving shuttles, for example.</p><p>The DOT challenge asked cities to apply new technologies and ideas about transit to close the gap between rich and poor, \u201cso that the future of transportation meets the needs of all city residents, not just those who are technology savvy.\u201d Portland, Oregon, responded with a plan for a bulk purchase of low-emission electric vehicles for low-income communities and to promote bike- and car-sharing services in those neighborhoods. Los Angeles, meantime, has concentrated some of its smart-city efforts on \u201cdigital inclusion,\u201d such as a project to make the Internet available in homeless encampments.</p><p>These efforts reflect a call by the National League of Cities for urban leaders to wield smart tech in pursuit of social justice. A 2015 report from the group urged government leaders and businesses to make more jobs available to low-income urban residents by reducing \u201cjob sprawl\u201d and directing economic development to dense urban centers, which could be linked with poor communities via new smart-transit systems. It\u2019s all part of a new \u201cequity movement,\u201d the report declared.</p><p>Similarly, the Smart Cities Council, an international group of companies, universities, and policy organizations, has launched a Compassionate Cities initiative, seeking to \u201censure that digital technologies improve the human condition.\u201d Among other things, the group has advocated for technology that it says can help reduce child hunger by encouraging mothers to breastfeed children\u2014such as Momsense, a device that helps track how well a baby is taking in its mother\u2019s milk. Compassionate Cities also touts efforts like a New York City pilot program that combs public records, including court proceedings and shelter data, to identify families at risk of becoming homeless.</p><p>\u201cAs the smart-city movement has expanded, it has become more ideological\u2014and more controversial.\u201d</p><p>As the smart-city movement has expanded, it has become more ideological\u2014and more controversial. Earlier this year, for example, a group of nonprofits, governments, and firms released a list of \u201cshared mobility principles for livable cities.\u201d To be sustainable, the group maintained, twenty-first-century cities must be increasingly dense and should emphasize \u201cwalking, cycling, public transport and other efficient shared mobility.\u201d Key to this agenda: a push to \u201cdiscourage the use of cars, single-passenger taxis, and other oversized vehicles transporting one person.\u201d Eventually, cities should ban private cars outright, the group said, and instead sanction public fleets, shared by all city residents. Among the signatories to the plan, unsurprisingly, were ride-sharing firms like Uber and Zipcar.</p><p>Over the last decade or so, America has witnessed the rise of Silicon Valley giants that want not merely to sell the public their latest gadgets and apps but\u2014far more ambitiously\u2014to disrupt society and reshape it according to their own dictates. Such an enterprise should raise fundamental questions about the evolution of the smart-city idea. \u201c[T]he discourse around smart cities is carried by an urban \u2018tech-elite\u2019 of IT corporations, young, well-educated, mostly white and male professionals, and apolitical aspiring city managers,\u201d observed Erasmus University sociologist Liesbet van Zoonen, in a 2016 article in Government Information Quarterly. That reality recalls the Progressive movement of the early twentieth century, which imagined a society governed by a cadre of educated elites instead of by ordinary people through their elected representatives.</p><p>The type of urban future that smart-city enthusiasts envision is reflected in the plans of several technology giants for developing residential communities abutting their headquarters\u2014twenty-first-century versions of the company town. Facebook intends to build a \u201cmixed-use village\u201d adjoining its Menlo Park corporate headquarters. The 56-acre site will offer some 1,500 housing units, 126,000 square feet of retail space, and several office towers, all situated in a dense, walkable neighborhood. While conveniently located for employees, the planned community seems designed solely for single workers, content with living childless in small units in high-rise towers; raising a family in such a compact environment would be difficult, to put it mildly. Google\u2019s community-building plans go even further in this direction. It has won approval for a massive campus of housing, retail, and offices near its Mountain View headquarters. Of the nearly 10,000 units of housing that the company will create, 70 percent will be studio or one-bedroom apartments, a plan that officials said would \u201cset a tone for residential development in the Bay Area.\u201d</p><p>Facebook executives look over plans for a high-tech residential village adjoining the company\u2019s Menlo Park corporate headquarters. (JASON HENRY/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX) Facebook executives look over plans for a high-tech residential village adjoining the company\u2019s Menlo Park corporate headquarters. (JASON HENRY/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX)</p><p>Many observers have noted that the rapidly expanding tech companies have helped cause the problem that they\u2019re trying to solve\u2014a wild increase in the price of shelter in and around Silicon Valley. Less often acknowledged is that California\u2019s restrictive land-use policies have slowed construction, contributing to a chronic housing shortage that also drives up costs. New zoning initiatives would only accelerate the process of pushing people into the smart-city model of increasingly dense, compact neighborhoods. \u201cOnce seen as a human-scale alternative to the crowded cities of the past, California\u2019s cities are targeted by policymakers and planners dreaming of bringing back the \u2018good old days,\u2019 circa 1900, when most people in the largest cities lived in small, cramped apartments,\u201d Wendell Cox and Joel Kotkin wrote recently.</p><p>It\u2019s doubtful, however, that most Americans yearn for the ever-greater density that smart-city enthusiasts are championing. As Cox and Kotkin observe, 2017 census figures confirm that the \u201ctrend of people moving to metros with the densest urban cores . . . is clearly over\u201d; migration to suburbs is increasing. Similarly, observations by smart-city advocates \u201cthat millennials are eschewing cars,\u201d a view used to justify urban planning that seeks the end of private automobile ownership, turn out to be premature, as consumers aged 21 to 34 rush to purchase automobiles.</p><p>A few countries have already tried to build smart cities from scratch; to date, things haven\u2019t gone that well. Starting in the late 2000s, South Korea has forged Songdo on land reclaimed from the Yellow Sea, roughly 40 miles from Seoul. Situated close to Inchon International Airport and designed as a low-carbon, super-high-tech modern metropolis, Songdo was supposed to be a magnet for international businesses and top educational institutions. Advanced systems reprocess waste in Songdo, reducing the need for garbage collection, while hundreds of cameras throughout the city monitor traffic and public order. Yet, despite its newness and amenities, Songdo hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations. So far, firms have brought about 70,000 jobs to the city\u2014well below the 300,000 originally projected. Songdo\u2019s reputation as a dehumanizing urban landscape may be partly to blame. \u201cI\u2019m, like, in prison for weekdays. That\u2019s what we call it in the workplace,\u201d one woman who commutes to her job in Songdo from Seoul told a reporter several years ago. Another critic describes the city as \u201csilent and post-apocalyptic.\u201d Even Songdo\u2019s chief designer, Park Yeon Soo, is disappointed. While he characterizes his elaborately planned city as a luxury car, he admits that he\u2019s still waiting for a good driver to \u201caccelerate\u201d it.</p><p>An eco-friendly, technology-rich metropolis under construction near Abu Dhabi International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, Masdar has proved even less successful. A proposed combination of residential, retail, and commercial projects\u2014including research-and-development centers and light industry\u2014the city was to serve as a model of high-tech economic development at near-zero carbon emissions, featuring electric self-driving cars and sophisticated recycling systems. Masdar has had trouble generating business or residential interest, and the project has moved along glacially: it was originally scheduled for completion in 2016, but advocates now hope that it will be fully built by 2030. Visitors call it a ghost town, and designers admit that it won\u2019t meet its original environmental goals any time soon.</p><p>Masdar is further along, though, than Yachay, a project of the Ecuadoran government at one time dubbed the City of Knowledge. Government leaders hoped to build a world-class research university in the country\u2019s northern Andes and surround it with a new smart city that would attract private high-tech firms. The City of Knowledge would then help power the nation\u2019s economy. But the cost of the project exploded, even as Ecuador\u2019s energy-based economy struggled, and the government began withdrawing its support. The City of Knowledge may wind up dying before it is built.</p><p>Closer to home, much of the work of building smart communities from the ground up will likely be done by private groups. Microsoft founder Bill Gates and other investors have purchased 25,000 acres of land west of Phoenix, where they plan to construct a smart city that one day would be home to 180,000 people. The project remains in the planning stages, but cutting-edge technology will be a feature. Meantime, Sidewalk Labs, a division of Google parent Alphabet, is working with Toronto and the development group Waterfront Toronto to create a smart neighborhood along that city\u2019s waterfront. The technology-supported environment would boast a thermal grid to recirculate energy, embedded snow-melters to clear sidewalks after storms, and autonomous transit systems.</p><p>Whether such top-down, planned communities will prove attractive to potential residents and workers remains to be seen. But that\u2019s only part of the challenge that smart cities face. In an age when data breaches and misuses of information at government agencies and private firms make news regularly, some critics worry about the vulnerability of heavily wired communities. In an April 2017 Harvard Business Review essay, \u201cSmart Cities Are Going to Be a Security Nightmare,\u201d Todd Thibodeaux, president of the information-technology trade group CompTIA, noted that smart cities already contain an estimated 2.3 billion networked devices, often connected with critical systems. Many are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks\u2014as hackers know. A video game called Watch Dogs challenges players to hack the central operating system of a futuristic Chicago and spy on residents or disable critical infrastructure; real life is quickly imitating the game. Last year, hackers set off 156 emergency sirens in Dallas, to take one example. In another, hackers hijacked the controls of an Illinois utility and destroyed a water pump serving some 2,200 households. Hackers are probing ways to inflict truly serious damage, as when Iranian cyberterrorists launched a failed 2015 attack on the controls of a small dam used for flood control in New York State.</p><p>Some fear that the smart-city movement will produce a society conceding ever more governing functions to technologists, urban planners, and the algorithms that they design\u2014undermining democracy. Such anxieties have been heightened by growing concerns over the casual way that big-tech companies like Facebook have treated the data that they gather about users. Declarations from Silicon Valley leaders that modern society should fret less about privacy and welcome the benefits of Big Data haven\u2019t reassured critics. Internet pioneer Vinton Cerf sparked a controversy in 2013 when he observed that privacy was relatively new in human experience and \u201cmay be an anomaly,\u201d adding that, in the future, \u201cit will be increasingly difficult for us to achieve privacy.\u201d \u201cPrivacy, as we understand it, is only about 150 years old. For 3,000 years, people have generally chosen convenience or money over privacy,\u201d Silicon Valley observer Greg Ferenstein has written.</p><p>Those attitudes seem less prevalent outside Silicon Valley. When Toronto held the first public meeting to discuss Sidewalk Labs\u2019 project, the Torontoist website gathered questions that residents wanted answered. Many were about privacy, including: Who will own the data that city sensors gather? Residents also wanted to know whether individuals would be tracked in real time and whether data would be collected anonymously. Underlying the worries is the real prospect that a project so committed to data as the basis of governing society will have trouble restraining itself. \u201c[T]he potential to mine the data for more personalized information and targeting of city services [is] endless and hence, there is a continuous risk of these services being pulled . . . away from service to surveillance,\u201d van Zoonen observes.</p><p>Progressive advocates see the smart city as a planning tool that could help them achieve their ambitious agenda, but urbanist Adam Greenfield views such thinking as based on the wrongheaded belief that \u201cthere is only one universal and transcendently correct solution to each identified individual or collective human need\u201d and that \u201cthis solution can be arrived at algorithmically.\u201d In a 2016 report to the Irish government on smart cities, social scientist Rob Kitchin warned that the smart-city movement \u201ctreats the city as a knowable, rational, steerable machine, rather than a complex system full of wicked problems and competing interests,\u201d and that increasingly, smart-city thinking \u201cpromotes top-down technocratic forms of governance.\u201d</p><p>In The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs observed that a persistent myth of post\u2013War World II urban planning was that if we just had enough money, we could solve problems like housing the poor and reversing neighborhood decay by building the right kind of neighborhoods. Instead, Jacobs pointed out, much of the public money made things worse\u2014for the poor, the middle class, and those living in luxury communities.

Firstly, a brief overview is given of the legal context and relevant Big Data developments in Australia. Then, current EU developments, particularly the data portability right under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and recent proposals from the Commission aiming at fostering access and transfer of data including the data producer\u2019s right to use and authorise the data and the portability of non-personal data for professional users are considered.

Given the coming into force of the GDPR and its extraterritorial reach, and the EU-Australia Free Trade Agreement currently under negotiation, as well as the transnational reach of Big Data and Cloud services, standardisation across the two jurisdictions is desirable. In this regard, the article examines to what extent the recent initiatives contribute to such standardisation and their implications for the extent to which Australia\u2019s legal framework for data may be considered \u2018adequate\u2019 by the EU. Keywords: Data Economy, Data Portability, Consumer Data Right, Data Access, GDPR</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I. Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The digital economy has involved large amounts of data being generated by and about individuals using online services and other technology products, with the archetypal example being users \u2018paying\u2019 for services which have no monetary cost with their data, which is the case with Facebook and Google for instance. This data is of great economic importance to digital services and products, which use it to profile users, modify their offerings, target advertising and sell on to third parties - practices which pose threats to individuals\u2019 data protection and privacy rights from a fundamental rights perspective. Furthermore, individuals\u2019 economic and consumer rights may also be negatively affected by these data gathering practices and uses, since individuals may find themselves \u2018locked in\u2019 to a particular service and unable to move their data to other services. This has potential consequences for competition in markets given the barriers to entry that this accumulation of data by players already operating in the market present to potential entrants, and the difficulty for consumers to switch between existing providers.<sup>1</sup></p><p>In order to address some of these issues, the Australian Productivity Commission \u2013 an independent arms-length statutory public agency, which provides advice to the Australian Government on microeconomic policy, regulation and other social and environmental issues<sup>2</sup> \u2013 issued a report in 2017 on Data Availability and Use, among whose recommendations was the introduction of a new \u2018Comprehensive right to access and use digital data\u2019 for consumers.<sup>3</sup></p><p>This article examines this \u2018Comprehensive right to access and use data\u2019 proposed by the Productivity Commission, against developments in the European Union (EU) in the same field. Aside from the fact that both jurisdictions are considering the implementation of new measures to address some of the problems the digital economy presents for consumers, they are also both currently involved in free trade agreement negotiations, which may have implications for their respective regulations in this area, especially if there is currently divergence. Furthermore, with the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) now in force, its extra-territorial effects may also have an impact on data practices in Australia. Therefore, a comparison of the two jurisdictions\u2019 approaches so far is pertinent and timely. Before looking in more detail at the proposed Comprehensive right, some background context on Australia will now be given for a European audience. </p><p>II. Australian Context</p><p>Australia is a Western-style liberal democracy with a common law legal system, based to a large extent on English law. It has some similarities with the US since it has a written Constitution (based on the US Constitution) and is a federal system, with a federal-level, and state and territory-level jurisdictions. It continues to be influenced by legal developments in other common law jurisdictions, especially England and the US, but increasingly has looked to developments in the EU, particularly as regards regulatory issues including new technologies.</p><p>Australia has various laws which are relevant to the large accumulations of data currently being generated in the digital economy, with data protection, whose main legislative instrument is the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), most prominent among them. Like the EU, Australia has consumer and competition laws which may apply to data issues. Unlike the EU, there is no equivalent in Australian intellectual property law to the rights contained in the Database Directive, either within copyright law or as sui generis rights.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Broadly speaking, the Privacy Act<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>is based on a similar model to the EU Data Protection Directive,<sup>5</sup> although there are no constitutional protections for the right to privacy (or data protection for that matter) in Australian federal law. This is despite the fact that Australia is a signatory to international human rights treaties including the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which includes the right to privacy.<sup>6</sup> The Privacy Act applies to \u2018personal information\u2019, and governs the collection, use, storage and disclosure of this information, and also provides rights to access and correct this information for individuals. There are several divergences between the Privacy Act and EU data protection law, which is partly the reason Australia is not currently granted \u2018adequacy\u2019 status as a third country by the EU.<sup>7</sup> These include: small and medium enterprises with an annual turnover of less than AUS$3 million being excluded from the Privacy Act\u2019s obligations; various further broad exceptions and carve-outs from the Privacy Act\u2019s obligations for law enforcement and security agency activities; Australia\u2019s participation in the Five Eyes surveillance partnership; and the introduction of mandatory data retention legislation (after the EU\u2019s Data Retention Directive was invalidated in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Digital Rights Ireland</emphasis>).<sup>8</sup> In addition, individuals do not have a direct means of enforcing their rights under the Privacy Act in courts, and instead must make a complaint to the federal Privacy Commissioner to investigate. However, there is concern that the federal Privacy Commissioner is under-resourced to perform this role properly.<sup>9</sup> Furthermore, a tort of invasion of privacy is not currently recognised by Australian common law.<sup>10</sup></p><p>As regards the governance of Big Data, as mentioned above, other areas of law such as competition and consumer law may apply. Yet in practice, Australia has been somewhat \u2018behind\u2019 other jurisdictions such as the EU, and to a lesser extent the US, especially as regards the application of competition law. To date, there has been no investigation opened by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) against Google analogous to those in the EU (and that concluded in the US) despite the fact that Google is likely to have a dominant position in the market(s) for online search and advertising in Australia.<sup>11</sup> The reason why the ACCC has not opened such an investigation in unclear,<sup>12</sup> although its current Inquiry into Digital Platforms (discussed in more detail below) may prove to be the initiation of some regulatory activity on this topic.</p><p>Some of the main legal proceedings involving Google in Australia to date were initiated by the ACCC on the basis of its role as the consumer regulator, in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Google v ACCC</emphasis> case,<sup>13</sup> in which the ACCC alleged Google was engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allowing the competitors of trade mark owners to buy AdWords comprising the trade marked term, and then displaying adverts from those competitors when a consumer searched for the trade marked term.<sup>14</sup> The High Court of Australia (the supreme court in the Australian court hierarchy and ultimate court of appeal) found that Google itself was not liable for misleading and deceptive conduct in the circumstances. Despite the outcome in this particular case \u2013 and despite the fact it concerned principally Google\u2019s \u2018front end\u2019 search results pages rather than its vast \u2018back end\u2019 data collection, analysis and use \u2013 there is the potential for existing consumer law provisions to be utilised more to deal with data issues in the digital economy, in both Australia and the EU, in the form of its prohibitions both against misleading and deceptive conduct, and unfair terms in consumer contracts.<sup>15</sup></p><p>While there may have been limited regulatory intervention thus far concerning data practices in Australian digital economy markets on the basis of data protection, consumer and competition law, there have been inquiries and proposals for reform. Prominently, in 2015 the Harper Review of Competition Policy recommended that the Government consider ways to improve individuals' ability to access their own data to inform consumer choices.<sup>16</sup> The Productivity Commission\u2019s proposed Consumer Right to Access and Use Digital Data is an attempt to put the Harper Review\u2019s recommendation into practice. Furthermore, at the time of writing, the ACCC has opened an Inquiry into Digital Platforms:</p><p>The inquiry will look at the effect that digital search engines, social media platforms and other digital content aggregation platforms have on competition in media and advertising services markets. In particular, the inquiry will look at the impact of digital platforms on the supply of news and journalistic content and the implications of \u00ad\u00adthis for media content creators, advertisers and consumers.<sup>17</sup></p><p>An Issues Paper was released in February 2018. From the  Issues Paper and the Terms of Reference, it appears that the Inquiry is framed as one examining in particular the impact of digital platforms such as Facebook and Google on the media and advertising industries, and consumers, from both competition and consumer law perspectives.<sup>18</sup> The ACCC is scheduled to deliver a preliminary report on the topic in December 2018. The extent to which the Inquiry may deliver positive outcomes for consumers and their data, as opposed to incumbent media and advertising companies, remains to be seen.</p><p>III. European Context</p><p>In the last few years, the EU has also been exploring different ways to maximise the value of the enormous amount of digital data generated by consumers, sensors, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices to individuals and the society at large while protecting the fundamental human rights of individuals. This has led to the adoption of different measures, starting with the 2012 reform package on data protection,<sup>19</sup> the 2014 Communication \u2018Towards a thriving data-driven economy\u2019<sup>20</sup> and the 2015 Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe,<sup>21</sup> which partly culminated with the adoption of the GDPR on 27 April 2016.<sup>22</sup> These initiatives are followed-up by the proposal for the ePrivacy Regulation,<sup>23</sup> the 2017 Communication on \u2018Building an EU Data Economy\u2019,<sup>24</sup> the proposed Regulation on Free Flow of Non-Personal Data<sup>25</sup> and 2018 Communication \u2018Towards a common European data space\u2019.<sup>26</sup> Although the measures across those initiatives are interlinked and are generally relevant for the Australian discussions, three aspects are of particular importance for the Comprehensive Right to access and use digital data. These are: the data portability right under Article 20 of the GDPR; and some of the proposed measures for \u2018fostering data access and transfer\u2019 under the Data Economy Communication such as the data producer\u2019s right and the portability of non-personal data for professional users under the Proposed Regulation on Free Flow of Non-Personal Data. However, before delving into the analysis on the extent that the proposed Australian Right accords with the EU initiatives, a brief overview of the latter is provided. </p><p>1. Data Portability Right </p><p>At its core, data portability allows users of digital information services, such as Facebook, to transfer their data, eg photos, status updates, and videos, to another provider with ease. In the EU, it has been codified as a right under Article 20 of the GDPR, and is described as the \u2018true innovation\u2019 of the data protection law reform,<sup>27</sup> which can be justified for two reasons. One is as an extension of an existing right to access one\u2019s data and another is as a mechanism to deal with lock-in effects or high switching costs resulting from usage or technical difficulties that can prevent users from shifting to another service. The two components of the right to data portability under the GDPR cater to these two justifications.  </p><p>The first component is the data subject\u2019s right to obtain a copy of their personal data from the controller \u2018in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format\u2019.<sup>28</sup> This aspect of the right is related to the data subject\u2019s access rights and can facilitate the exercise or enforcement of other rights under the GDPR, eg, the data security principle (by giving users a backup copy), and the right to object to processing or erasure of data which is inaccurate or incomplete. The second component of the right enables the data subject to transmit or to have the data transmitted, where technically feasible, by the controller from one automated processing system to another one.<sup>29</sup> This aspect of the right allows the data subject to take their personal data and leave (\u2018voting with one\u2019s feet\u2019). In this sense, the data portability right is partly driven by economic rationales, namely the desire to reduce switching costs between providers and thereby facilitate competition, including through privacy, among providers.<sup>30</sup></p><p>The exercise of the data portability right is dependent on three conditions. The first precondition is that the data must be provided by data subjects themselves (volunteered data), although the Article 29 Working Party has opined that the right should extend to \u2018observed data\u2019.<sup>31</sup> This means users will not have the possibility to port \u2018inferred data\u2019 and \u2018derived data\u2019, which include personal data that are created by a service provider (for example, algorithmic results).<sup>32</sup> For example, a user of Facebook can only obtain data that they have posted to Facebook, not data posted by their Facebook friends or data that Facebook obtains from third party data brokers. Neither is the data that Facebook infers about users, such as their sexuality or political leanings,<sup>33</sup> subject to this right. This makes the effective enforcement of such a right challenging without interoperability across platforms or services.<sup>34</sup> The Commission seems to recognise this challenge and is undertaking initiatives to address this problem in the area of healthcare. With the aim of facilitating access and sharing of health data by users, the Commission is considering a mechanism for facilitating the interoperability of electronic health records, including a recommendation on a European exchange format for electronic health records.<sup>35</sup></p><p>The second precondition is that, even when the data is provided by the data subject, the legal basis for processing should be based on either consent of the data subject or contract \u2013 meaning that processing based on legal obligations imposed on the controller or the vital interest of the data subject does not give rise to such an obligation. The third, perhaps redundant, precondition is that the right applies to a processing of personal data by \u2018automated means\u2019.<sup>36</sup></p><p>Current implementations of the right seem to focus on the first component ie the right to obtain a copy of your data. For example, Facebook\u2019s tool allows users to download a copy of their information either in HTML or JSON formats.<sup>37</sup> The latter allows users to download their data in machine-readable format and users are able to transfer/upload the information to another service. Similarly, Google allows users to download their data either to their own computer, or to storage services like OneDrive, Dropbox and Box.<sup>38</sup> However, the tools still fall short of allowing users to take their business elsewhere. This is because, under the current tools, service-to-service data transfers would require the user to download and re-upload it to another and expect the format is interoperable with the latter service. This notwithstanding, the big tech companies are joining forces to allow direct service-to-service data transfers. Recently, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft launched a joint initiative, the Data Transfer Project, with aim of facilitating direct transfer of data from one service to another.<sup>39</sup> What makes the tool different from current technologies is that users do not need to \u2018download and re-upload\u2019.<sup>40</sup> This reduces the reliance consumers\u2019 potentially limited bandwidth and capability to transfer data from one service provider to another.<sup>41</sup></p><p>It bears mentioning that the data portability right might raise concerns both for the data subject exercising the right or other data subjects. For example, in the absence of strict security requirements in exercising the right, moving all of a person\u2019s data to another system \u2018without hindrance\u2019 creates security risks that can outweigh the portability benefits.<sup>42</sup> This is the case where unintended privacy harms can occasion when consumers pull information in to less protected spaces and to providers with different policy and privacy norms. In this regard, the GDPR restricts the right to the extent it adversely affects \u2018the rights and freedoms of others\u2019.<sup>43</sup> A case of such conflict might arise when the data portability right of a user impinges on other users\u2019 right to be forgotten because the data of the users are inseparable and prevent the latter from having their data erased.<sup>44</sup> In such cases, the right to erasure would override the right to data portability.<sup>45</sup></p><p>2. Data Access and Transfer </p><p>Fostering access and transfer of data, particularly machine-generated data is one of the core objectives behind the recent Commission Communication on EU Data Economy.<sup>46</sup> This need is justified for various reasons. The first is the unwillingness of many large data-generating organisations to share data with other entities. The Commission indicates that many companies that generate large sets of data do not share the data with third parties and thereby restricting its further use in other (downstream) markets.<sup>47</sup> This is further complicated by the difficulty for users and customers of transferring their data from one provider to another provider. More particularly, the Commission notes that some manufacturers or service providers have become \u2018<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">de facto</emphasis>\u2019 owners of the data despite the fact that the devices that generate the data are owned by the user, and thereby preventing users, through either technical measures (storage of data in proprietary formats) or imposing potentially unfair terms on the user, from sharing or transferring the data.<sup>48</sup> These practices, together with the uncertainties on legal protection given to machine-generated data under the EU framework, are considered to hinder the further use of data for innovative services, to improve products or production processes and to support decision-making. The Commission then outlines different measures that could help address the problems with data access and transfer. </p><p>One such measure is to provide different incentives for sharing and transferring such data. Among other things, the Commission considers providing guidance on \u2018how non-personal data control rights should be addressed in contracts.\u2019<sup>49</sup> This guidance might outline the transparency requirements in terms of how the data is used, including the fairness of terms in light of existing consumer protection laws and other protections under the Trade Secrets Directive and Database Directive. Part of this initiative is further taken up in the proposed Regulation on the Free Flow of Non-Personal Data, which is further elaborated below. More importantly, in its recent Communication, the Commission provides guiding principles for sharing of data between businesses (B2B).<sup>50</sup> Key principles for B2B data sharing are: a) transparency, b) shared value creation,<sup>51</sup> c) respect for each other\u2019s commercial interests, d) ensure undistorted competition,<sup>52</sup> and e) minimised data lock-in.<sup>53</sup></p><p>The second measure that the Commission sees as facilitating access and transfer of machine-generated data is the development of technical measures that enable the reliable identification of the source of data that aim at increasing trust and benefit sharing.<sup>54</sup> This requires fostering technical solutions that can trace and link the sources of the data so that the integrity of the data can be checked and benefits generated from the reuse of the data could be shared with the original sources.<sup>55</sup> Such sharing of benefits is believed to increase the willingness to share and transfer data. This is a mechanism for implementing one of the above principles, ie, shared value creation. </p><p>The third consideration involves the use of default contract rules for sharing and transferring machine-generated data.<sup>56</sup> The idea is that the Commission might come up with default contract terms for accessing and transferring such data and those default rules could serve as a benchmark for assessing the \u2018fitness\u2019 of other terms including in B2B relationships. This implies that the default rules could be used to invalidate contract terms that excessively deviate from such rules. A related consideration is to extend the application of the Unfair Contracts Directive,<sup>57</sup> which currently applies to B2C contracts, to B2B relationships. The fourth is related to facilitating access of such data \u2018for public interest and scientific purposes\u2019.<sup>58</sup> This recognizes the public interest in accessing the machine-generated data for statistical, environmental or traffic management purposes. In this regard, the recent Communication outlines the following guiding principles for the sharing of data between businesses and governments: a) proportionality in the use of private sector data, b) purpose limitation, c) do no harm, d) conditions for data re-use, e) mitigate limitations of private sector data, and f) transparency and societal participation.<sup>59</sup> The accompanying Staff Working Document also discusses three models for data sharing, namely, an open data approach, data monetisation on a data marketplace and data exchange in a closed platform.<sup>60</sup> Additionally, this Document provides a \u2018How to\u2019 guide on legal, business and technical aspects of data sharing\u2019 between businesses.</p><p>The fifth, perhaps most ambitious project, is to recognize the data producer\u2019s right to use and authorise the data.<sup>61</sup> The data producer is the person or entity that owns or leases for long-term the devices that generate the data. This is to be contrasted with the data holder, which is the person or the entity that \u2018manages and retains the machine-generated data in practice.\u2019<sup>62</sup> The aim of this right is to make it easier for the producer to utilise the data by providing the user more choices for generating value from the data. Among other things, this right aims at granting the producer an \u2018exclusive right to utilise certain data, including the right to licence its usage.\u2019<sup>63</sup> This could be done by assigning a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">right in rem</emphasis> or de facto \u2018possession\u2019 right that is enforceable against third parties and regardless of contractual relationships including the right to prevent further use and claim damages for unauthorised use of the data.<sup>64</sup> However, the Commission underlines the need to take account of the interest of the data holder, particularly in light of the investments in building the infrastructure, and interests of public authorities to access such data for public interest and scientific purposes. </p><p>The aforementioned right has raised many controversies in terms of its scope, impact on other rights and freedoms and its effectiveness.<sup>65</sup> For example, there are claims that such a right creates multiple competing claims of ownership over data due to its significant overlap with pre-existing IP rights, the sui generis database right and trade secrets.<sup>66</sup> Moreover, it can impinge on fundamental freedoms, particularly, freedom of expression and information by restricting, for instance, scientists\u2019 access to data and freedom of competition.<sup>67</sup> Others question the need for a new right as existing rights and rules, including IP and competition laws, already provide the necessary protection and incentives to share data.<sup>68</sup></p><p>Another ambitious idea for facilitating access and transfer of data is to develop schemes for remuneration for sharing data.<sup>69</sup> More particularly, the Commission in exploring the possibility of developing guiding principles for sharing of machine-generated data,<sup>70</sup> particularly through the use of Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms for sharing data. <sup>71</sup> This scheme is currently used for sharing essential standard patents. </p><p>All of the above initiatives are accompanied by measures to respect individuals\u2019 data privacy. The Communication underlines that if the machine-generated data to be shared is personal data, its sharing, be it with other third parties or with public authorities, should be done in compliance with the GDPR.<sup>72</sup> In this regard, the Commission encourages the use of anonymisation techniques. Other measures include the need to establish different categories of data and adopting appropriate measures in light of each category before the data is being shared with other parties.<sup>73</sup></p><p>3. Portability of Non-Personal Data </p><p>Another measure that aims at fostering access and transfer of data is the extension of the data portability right under the GDPR to non-personal data.<sup>74</sup> This extension, which was initially articulated in the Commission Communication for EU Data Economy, is now encoded within the proposed Regulation on Free Flow of Non-Personal Data.<sup>75</sup> The proposed Regulation recognizes the need to facilitate the portability of non-personal data by professional users.<sup>76</sup> However, unlike the prescriptive nature of the data portability right under the GDPR, the Commission seems to prefer a light-touch regulatory approach that aims at creating an environment that facilitates the portability of non-personal data by professional users. Notably, the Commission undertakes to \u2018encourage and facilitate the development of self-regulatory codes of conduct\u2019 and best practices that facilitate switching of providers. In this regard, emphasis is given to measures that ensure transparency of the terms and conditions of service providers on data access and transfer. Accordingly, the codes of conduct should ensure that professional users are provided with \u2018sufficiently detailed, clear and transparent information\u2019 by the data storage or data processing service provider before the conclusion of the contract as regards the following issues:<sup>77</sup></p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>the processes, technical requirements, timeframes and charges that apply in case a professional user wants to switch to another provider or port data back to its own IT systems, including the processes and location of any data back-up, the available data formats and supports, the required IT configuration and minimum network bandwidth; the time required prior to initiating the porting process and the time during which the data will remain available for porting; and the guarantees for accessing data in the case of the bankruptcy of the provider; and</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>the operational requirements to switch or port data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format allowing sufficient time for the user to switch or port the data.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Despite the initial enthusiasm to introduce portability rights for non-personal data under the Communication on an EU Data Economy, the approach adopted seems to focus on stimulating the market to respond to the challenges, rather than to prescribe how and when such portability should occur. The provision of this information is believed to increase competition among service provi\u00ad\u00adders on this aspect so that users can select their service provider based on such considerations of data access and transfer. However, given the dominance of few players in the data storage and processing services, the extent that such self-regulatory mechanisms would address the concerns raised by the Commission remains to be seen.<sup>78</sup> This is particularly the case if noncompliance with the codes of conduct is not accompanied by some kind of sanction. </p><p>IV. The Proposed Australian Consumer Right to Access and Use Digital Data</p><p>The Australian Productivity Commission\u2019s 2017 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Data Availability and Use</emphasis> report was drafted as the outcome of an inquiry commissioned by the Australian Government to examine the \u2018benefits and costs of options for increasing availability of and improving the use of public and private sector data by individuals and organisation\u2019.<sup>79</sup> The aim of this inquiry was for the Productivity Commission to recommend policies in this area for the Federal Government to consider that would \u2018boost innovation and competition in Australia\u2019.<sup>80</sup></p><p>Among the Productivity Commission\u2019s main findings was recognition of the exponential growth in data and its use in the digital economy which put existing data protection frameworks in need of reform, a process in which Australia was not yet participating.<sup>81</sup> The Productivity Commission viewed that \u2018marginal changes to existing structures and legislation will not suffice\u2019, and it was necessary for data to be treated \u2018as an asset and not a threat\u2019.<sup>82</sup> Among the \u2018significant change needed for Australia\u2019s open government agenda and the rights of consumers to data\u2019 is the Productivity Commission\u2019s recommendation of: </p><p>A new Comprehensive Right for consumers [which] would give individuals and small/medium businesses opportunities for active use of their own data and represent fundamental reform to Australia\u2019s competition policy in a digital world. This right would create for consumers:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>powers comparable to those in the Privacy Act to view, request edits or corrections, and be advised of the trade to third parties of consumer information held on them </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>a new right to have a machine-readable copy of their consumer data provided.83</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The Comprehensive Right is intended as a counterpart to a new proposed risk-based structure for the sharing and release of both publicly- and privately-held datasets.<sup>84</sup> The Comprehensive Right appears to be conceptualised by the Productivity Commission as being part of the \u2018social licence\u2019 which, by ostensibly empowering consumers to make better use of their data, they will also be more likely to support others using their data as well.<sup>85</sup></p><p>The Productivity Commission acknowledges that currently Australians may have little control over how their data is used, and that the proposed Comprehensive Right would alter this by giving them such control which in turn \u2018would enable them to have more influence in how value is created and extracted from their data\u2019.<sup>86</sup> The proposed reform is explicitly framed as one to competition law, and \u2018not a subset of privacy law\u2019 despite similarities in operation and in terms of the subject-matter of the right.<sup>87</sup> The Productivity Commission, however, does acknowledge the existing rights consumers have to access data about themselves and correct that data, under privacy and freedom of information legislation but views these rights as being insufficient for consumer data use and access for various reasons, including a lack of understanding about what data is held about them and how to access it, a lack of meaningful consent to data being collected and used, and the lack of ease in authorising a third party to access a consumer\u2019s data directly from the organisation which holds it.<sup>88</sup></p><p>The Comprehensive Right would give consumers (defined as also including small and medium enterprises with an annual turnover of less than AU$3million, a narrower definition than under Australian consumer law) the right to:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>access a copy of data </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>provided directly by the consumer or</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>collected in the course of other actions (and including administrative datasets) and identifiable to that consumer (whether aggregated or not) or</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>held by the data holder even though created by others \u2014 for example through screen-scraping or tracking, purchase of data about a consumer, or re-identification </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>request edits or corrections for reasons of accuracy </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>direct holders of such data to copy the data in machine-readable form, either to the consumer directly or to a nominated third party (the \u2018transfer right\u2019) </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>be informed about the trade of any element of this data to third parties </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>be advised of disclosures of data to third parties.89 </p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The Right would apply to data held both by the public and private sectors. The scope of the data concerned would be broad and the Productivity Commission has suggested that it would cover digital data (and not paper-based data), which should be provided to the consumer in a machine-readable and interoperable format that is \u2018held by a product or service provider and identified with a consumer and associated with a product or service provided to that consumer\u2019. It would seem that the Productivity Commission intends for this definition to encapsulate a broader range of data than \u2018personal information\u2019 which is currently covered by Australian federal data protection law in the form of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Privacy Act</emphasis>:<sup>90</sup></p><p>Consumer data for this Right should be defined broadly and with a focus on desired outcomes, but with an opportunity for inclusion of data that is merely imputed to be about the consumer.<sup>91</sup></p><p>However, the application of the definition of \u2018personal information\u2019 in Australian law is currently unclear, despite recent litigation on the topic.<sup>92</sup> The Productivity Commission, though, does recommend the development of sector-specific definitions of consumer data by industry participants, which may vary from sector to sector. Data which is collected for security purposes or subject to intellectual property rights would be excluded from the definition of consumer data. </p><p>The Productivity Commission decided to withdraw some suggestions it made in its previous Draft Report on the topic, including a right for consumers to request that a data holder stop collecting information on them (due to \u2018inadvertent consequences and be[ing] difficult to implement\u2019) and a right to appeal automated decisions similar to the right to explanation in Article 22(1) of the GDPR (since consumers should be able to query the data on which the decision, automated or not, was based, and would already have a right to request corrections to incorrect data under the Comprehensive Right).<sup>93</sup></p><p>Exceptions to the Comprehensive Right may be broadly based on those currently in existence as regards access to personal information in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Privacy Act</emphasis>, and may include \u2018when giving access would prejudice current legal proceedings, be contrary to another law, or reveal information in conjunction with a commercially sensitive decision making process\u2019.<sup>94</sup></p><p>In terms of governance and enforcement of this Comprehensive Right, the Productivity Commission viewed that compliance should be driven by the ACCC \u2018since competition and consumer policy lies at the heart of the recommended changes\u2019.<sup>95</sup> This model is also contrasted against what the Productivity Commission sees as the \u2018American\u2019 approach where individuals are granted rights to sue organisations breaching their rights, in order to enforce those rights directly.<sup>96</sup></p><p>The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) is not viewed to have an active role in enforcing the Comprehensive Right, despite the proximity of the Comprehensive right to data privacy rights, whose enforcement falls within the OAIC\u2019s portfolio as federal Privacy Commissioner. Furthermore, the Productivity Commission emphatically recommends that the Comprehensive Data Right be implemented as part of entirely new legislation (\u2018Data Sharing and Release Act\u2019) rather than as an amendment to the existing <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Privacy Act</emphasis>.<sup>97</sup> The Productivity Commission seemed to find the \u2018human rights\u2019 framing of privacy as unhelpful for what it is trying to achieve with the Comprehensive Data Rights, since it saw a human rights lens as being \u2018unlikely to see cultural change\u2019 because \u2018it encourages data to be viewed as a risk rather than an asset\u2019. </p><p>V. Comparative Analysis </p><p>In the following paragraphs, we provide a comparison of the new Comprehensive Right proposed in the Australian Productivity Commission\u2019s report in light of the above three EU developments. This is followed by a discussion on the convergences between the EU and Australian data frameworks from these initiatives and their implications for Australia\u2019s adequacy assessment and the forthcoming EU-Australia free trade agreement negotiations given a potential agreement may include digital economy matters.<sup>98</sup></p><p>In light of the above discussions, the Comprehensive Right seems to contain a bundle of features from the data portability right under the GDPR, the Commission initiatives to foster data access and transfer and the portability of non-personal data. It is similar to the GDPR\u2019s data portability right because it allows consumers to port their personal data as defined by the Privacy Act. But it is broader than the data portability right under the GDPR because,<sup>99</sup> first, the new right covers data that is not strictly personal and there are no requirements for the data to be provided by the consumer.<sup>100</sup> The Comprehensive Right would apply to any data that can be \u2018identified with a consumer and associated with a product or service provided to that consumer\u2019, which may well extend beyond \u2018personal information\u2019 or \u2018personal data\u2019 to include items such as electronic consumption data and documents stored in cloud service provider. However, the Comprehensive Right might not extend to digital content purchased by a consumer given this is likely to be protected by IP which the Productivity Commission viewed as being a potential exception to the Comprehensive Right.</p><p>Secondly, unlike the GDPR\u2019s data portability right which only applies to data collected on the basis of consent or for the performance of a contract, the Australian Comprehensive Right would apply regardless of the basis for the initial data collection. Moreover, as mentioned above, the term \u2018consumer\u2019 would be defined broadly to include SMEs with \u2018a turnover of less than AU$3m pa in the most recent financial year.\u2019<sup>101</sup> This entails that data that can be linked to these SMEs would be subject to the Comprehensive Right requirements whereas the EU\u2019s data portability right applies to data that can be linked to a natural person.<sup>102</sup></p><p>In this regard, the Comprehensive Right is similar to the portability of non-personal data under the EU\u2019s proposed Regulation for Free Flow of Data as it covers data that relates to businesses. However, unlike the portability of non-personal data under the proposed EU Regulation, the Comprehensive Right imposes a maximum turnover-based restriction. Against this background, the portability initiative under the EU Regulation applies only to non-personal data, meaning that it does not apply to the portability of personal data by professional users (except where the user is a data subject, in which case they can rely on the GDPR). This is perhaps one of the weaknesses of the EU initiative because professional users including SMEs face similar challenges with transferring personal data stored with cloud service providers as with non-personal data. Thus, there is no good reason why such professional users should not be allowed to transfer personal data between cloud services providers. It is also doubtful if data privacy concerns justify such an exclusion because the ease of transfer or portability could actually contribute positively to protection of data privacy. Knowledge of the technical requirements for transferring to or retrieving data from their own systems, location of data back-up and bandwidths for access data are relevant for a data controller to ensure compliance with its obligations under the GDPR including the data security requirements and the rules on international transfer of data. It can also facilitate data controllers switching to providers that offer greater security and better access.<sup>103</sup> However, given the proposed solution focuses on stimulating the market to be transparent on the conditions of access and transfer, it can be expected that to the extent the proposal bears fruit, it will bring changes across the board including for access and transfer personal data stored with cloud service providers.  </p><p>In contrast, the Comprehensive Right would cover both \u2018personal information\u2019 as defined under the Australian Privacy Act and data that is otherwise imputable to a consumer, including a legal person in the form of an SME. In this sense, the Comprehensive Right would be broader in reach than both the GDPR\u2019s data portability right and the portability of non-personal data under the proposed Regulation for Free flow of Data (with the only exception being that the latter does not have a turnover-based restriction). However, there are several other EU instruments that allow consumers and competitors to access and sometimes port different kinds of data. For example, the Payment Service Directive 2,<sup>104</sup> which is effective as of 13 January 2018, has a provision that allows consumers but also entities, to access bank and transaction information. Similarly, the Internal Electricity Market Directive aims at improving consumers\u2019 access to their smart meter data.<sup>105</sup> The Commission has also tabled a proposal that allows third party providers to request access to such data with the consumers\u2019 consent.<sup>106</sup> Furthermore, the proposed Directive on Digital Content has a provision that gives consumers the right to retrieve their data from providers.<sup>107</sup> The Gas and Electricity Directives allow industrial customers right to access and transfer data. Regulation 715/2007 facilitates access to in-vehicle data for the purpose of after-market services such as maintenance and repair.<sup>108</sup> In combination, these sector-specific requirements may bring the EU framework closer to the Comprehensive Right, although they still suffer from fragmentation and a lack of cross-sector harmonisation. </p><p>Last but not least, the Comprehensive Right has similar objectives to the EU Commission initiatives that aim at fostering data access and transfer. It is particularly similar to the data producer\u2019s proposed right \u2018to utilise certain data, including the right to licence its usage.\u2019<sup>109</sup> As noted above, the Comprehensive Right has a similar objective of providing \u2018a social licence for wider data use, both public and private.\u2019<sup>110</sup> Both initiatives recognize the need to consider competing interests in the enforcement of the rights. For example, the European Commission initiative on the data producer\u2019s right to use and authorise data recognises the need to take account of the interest of the data holder, particularly in light of the investments in building the infrastructure, and interests of public authorities to access such data for public interest and scientific purposes. Similarly, the report from the Productivity Commission underlines that \u2018Consumer data would be a joint asset between the individual consumer and the entity holding the data. Exercise of the right by a consumer would not alter the ability of the initial data holder to retain and keep using the data.\u2019<sup>111</sup> Both initiatives are expected to increase competition and the value generated from digital data. However, the discussions on the data producer\u2019s right are limited to machine-generated non-personal data whereas the Comprehensive Right applies broadly to digital consumer data. </p><p>Apart from the Comprehensive Right, the report from the Productivity Commission contains several other initiatives that aim at facilitating data sharing and access. These include the establishment of Accredited Release Authorities (ARAs) that would oversee and administer a risk-based framework for sharing and releasing data both by private and private entities.<sup>112</sup> The report also considers the designation of certain databases as National Interest Datasets (NID) based on their value, uniqueness and quality (up-to-date, coverage).<sup>113</sup> The ARAs would be mandated to ensure that such databases are widely available for private and public uses. These are initiatives that have similar objectives with the EU Commission\u2019s measures aimed at fostering access and transfer of data by different incentives for sharing and transferring such data, encouraging the development of technical measures that enable the reliable identification of the source of data and enacting default contract rules for sharing and transferring machine-generated data.</p><p>From a broader policy perspective, the initiatives in the EU and Australia demonstrate the willingness to maximise the value of data for individuals and for society at large. Similarly, the reliance on light touch regulatory approaches to facilitate the access and transfer of data is common to both jurisdictions although the Australian proposals seem to be backed by a stick in the form of the ACCC intervening in case the relevant stakeholder fails to act. However, there seems to be a significant difference in the level of attention given to the privacy of individuals. For example, the initiatives from the Commission including the data producer\u2019s right to use and authorise data, access based on FRAND terms as well as the portability of data apply to anonymised data or data that is non-personal. None of these initiatives aim at adding new exceptions to the application of the GDPR. Where personal data is involved both the Communication and the Staff Working Document make it clear that access and use of such data should be subject to the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive. </p><p>While the Productivity Commission\u2019s report also recognizes the importance of the right to privacy and the need to respect existing privacy legislation,<sup>114</sup> it advocates further exceptions from obligations under the Privacy Act. More particularly, the proposal seeks to extend some of these exceptions \u2018allowing the sharing of personal information for health and medical research purposes without consent \u2026 to other areas of public interest research.\u2019<sup>115</sup> It also recommends the abolishment of the \u2018requirement to destroy linked datasets and statistical linkage keys at the completion of data integration projects\u2019, comparing hyperbolically such actions to \u2018book burning.\u2019<sup>116</sup> Given that the exceptions for SMEs under the Privacy Act<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>are part of the reason that Australia has not yet received the approval as a country that ensures \u2018adequate protection\u2019 under the EU Data Protection Directive, the potential to further expand these exceptions and carve-outs from the Privacy Act\u2019s protections would further weaken the case for Australia\u2019s \u2018adequacy\u2019 from an EU data protection perspective, in addition to other divergences from the GDPR. This scenario may be problematic for Australian entities handling EU citizens\u2019 data in scenarios which fall within Article 3(2) of the GDPR, as they may have to comply with both EU and Australian requirements concerning this data. Furthermore, any regulatory divergence may have to be overcome for the successful conclusion of an EU-Australia FTA if such an agreement is to include digital economy issues.</p><p>VI.  Conclusion</p><p>This article has offered a preliminary analysis of the Australian Productivity Commission\u2019s proposed Comprehensive Consumer Right to Access and Use Digital Data, and a comparison with similar initiatives in the European Union. Overall, both jurisdictions are seeking to facilitate greater access to data for consumers, driven by competition goals, to enable consumers to port their data between providers, with the hope of stimulating competition in digital markets. The jurisdictions diverge in certain ways, including the potential increased scope of the proposed Comprehensive Right compared to the GDPR\u2019s right to data portability, and the framing of the Comprehensive Right as a consumer or competition law measure as opposed to a data protection measure, while a similar right is contained within the EU\u2019s main data protection legislation and backed by the legal system\u2019s recognition of both privacy and data protection as fundamental rights. Another main divergence is the fact that the proposed Comprehensive Right remains a mere proposal rather than binding law, in contrast to the binding nature of the GDPR\u2019s right to data portability. </p><p>However, in late 2017, the Australian Government announced that it would introduce a Bill into the Australian Parliament during 2018 to implement a \u2018Consumer Data Right\u2019 into legislation.<sup>117</sup> More recently, the Australian Government confirmed this plan in its official response to the Productivity Commission report, where it also stated that the right would be implemented first in the banking,<sup>118</sup> energy and telecommunications sectors, and that, in contrast to the Productivity Commission\u2019s suggestions, the OAIC would have primary responsibility for individual consumer complaints (with the ACCC\u2019s role being at a more macro level, in \u2018supporting competition and good consumer outcomes\u2019) and the right would be introduced primarily through amendments to Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).<sup>119</sup></p><p>Yet, these measures, both implemented and proposed, in Australia and the EU for consumer data rights for the purposes of facilitating switching between providers, raise questions about how efficacious such rights actually are. There is very limited empirical research on the extent to which consumers make use of existing data rights they have regarding providers in some sectors, the extent to which this facilitates competition in practice, and the interplay with data protection frameworks. These rights, both existing and proposed, tend to implicate an idea of consumers who are pro-active about using and allowing others to use their data, and also, at a more abstract level, imagines data to be an asset rather than a fundamental right to be protected.<sup>120</sup> Data has a hybrid character, at least in the EU, where it is recognised to have economic as well as a fundamental rights aspects.<sup>121</sup> The Australian Productivity Commission\u2019s approach privileges this economic character over the fundamental rights character in its proposal for the Comprehensive Consumer Right. Given recent deficiencies with Australia\u2019s protection of data privacy, more account should be taken of data\u2019s dual character in any legislation introduced to the Australian Parliament to implement such a right.<sup>122</sup> The Australian Government\u2019s recent response does emphasise the need for the Consumer Data Right to be designed \u2018to ensure strong privacy protections and security safeguards\u2019. The implementation of the Consumer Data Rights ought to involve higher standards of data protection and security provisions and practices than is currently the case. </p><p>In the financial sector implementation of the Consumer Data Right via \u2018Open Banking\u2019, it does seem that more regard is being paid to privacy and data protection concerns.<sup>123</sup> The Australian Treasury has stated that consumers must give explicit, informed consent to data transfers and implied consent will not be permitted.<sup>124</sup> The Treasury also enumerated other specific ways in which privacy protections will be strengthened in the Right\u2019s implementation in banking, including the extension of Privacy Act protections to all accredited data recipients including SMEs which would not otherwise be bound by the provisions, and direct rights of action for consumers in the case of breaches.<sup>125</sup> The existence of a direct right of action is a major development from the Privacy Act scenario as mentioned earlier, where individuals are not able to bring an action themselves against a party in breach of their rights, and thus is an important step towards the better protection of fundamental rights in Australia. </p><p>However, the Consumer Data Right \u2013 which should perhaps be better termed \u2018the Consumer Data Portability Right\u2019 \u2013 is only a singular intervention in Australian law concerning data. Australian law needs a much more comprehensive overhaul to ensure better fundamental rights compliance \u2013 and \u2018adequacy\u2019 from an EU data protection law perspective \u2013 which the Consumer Data Right will not bring about alone.</p><p>Postscript</p><p>As this article was going to press, the Australian Treasury released the exposure draft legislation for the Consumer Data Right, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Consumer Data Right) Bill 2018, which contains proposed amendments principally to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, but also the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010. </p><p>A cursory glance at this Bill reveals that details of the Consumer Data Right\u2019s operation would be determined sector-by-sector through \u2018Consumer Data Rules\u2019 overseen by the ACCC, with the Consumer Data Right planned to be implemented initially in the banking sector. The Treasurer would be responsible for designating further sectors to which the right should apply. Before entities in a particular sector can receive transfers of consumer data, they should be \u2018accredited\u2019 by the ACCC (subject to some exceptions), with part of the accreditation process being adherence to privacy and security safeguards. These safeguards are considered by the Treasury to exceed those currently contained in the Privacy Act\u2019s Australian Privacy Principles, would apply to a broader range of data than \u2018personal information\u2019 and would also apply to SMEs which gain accreditation but which would not be subject to the Privacy Act. </p><p>These proposals suggest a definitive shift away from the Productivity Commission\u2019s privacy-unfriendly position to one that takes privacy issues far more seriously, and in fact seems to offer a higher level of protection than the existing Privacy Act. It remains to be seen whether this Bill becomes law, and if so, to what extent it may be amended from this initial form. However, the greater regard paid to privacy here is to be welcomed, and - while a full assessment is beyond the scope of this postscript, and in fact should form the basis of further research - may result in Australia providing an \u2018adequate\u2019 level of data protection by EU standards, at least as regards data portability.</p><p><sup>1</sup>See Maurice Stucke and Allen Grunes, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Big Data and Competition Policy</emphasis> (OUP 2016).</p><p><sup>2</sup>The Productivity Commission\u2019s reports and the guidance and recommendations contained therein are not binding on the Australian Government but the Australian Government usually (but not always) follows them and implements them in practice.</p><p><sup>3</sup>Productivity Commission, \u2018Data Availability and Use\u2019 (Inquiry Report No 82, 31 March 2017).</p><p><sup>4</sup>Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases OJ L 77/20.</p><p><sup>5</sup>Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data OJ L281/31.</p><p><sup>6</sup>Angela Daly, \u2018Privacy in Automation: An Appraisal of the Emerging Australian Approach\u2019 (2017) 33 Computer Law &amp; Security Review<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>836.</p><p><sup>7</sup>There is currently an agreement in place between Australia and the EU regarding the transfer of PNR data, however in light of the CJEU\u2019s Opinion on the EU-Canada PNR Agreement, the existing EU-Australia Agreement ought also to be invalidated.

Productivity Commission (n 3) 195-196.</p><p><sup>100</sup>However, the fact that data which is subject to intellectual property rights are be excluded from the definition of consumer data and from the Comprehensive right could have a similar effect. This is because similar commercial and IP considerations are behind the exclusion of data created by the controller from portability right under the GDPR.</p><p><sup>101</sup>Productivity Commission (n 3) 191.</p><p><sup>102</sup>From a procedural standpoint, the Productivity Commission envisaged the Comprehensive Right being enforced by the ACCC with federal Privacy Commissioner playing no active role. The Australian Government response, mentioned below, diverges in apportioning the OAIC with primary responsibility for complaints. This aligns more with the situation in the EU: while the door is open for consumer protection authorities to play an active role, the enforcement is primarily incumbent on Data Protection Authorities. However, the need for closer cooperation among the different authorities needs to be emphasized. In this regard, the establishment of a digital clearinghouse that facilitates cooperation among data protection, consumer protection and competition law authorities by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EPDS) is a move in the right direction. See EDPS, \u2018Opinion 8/2016 on coherent enforcement of fundamental rights in the age of big data\u2019 (2016).</p><p><sup>103</sup>Perhaps one reason is that a data controller is under the obligation, pursuant to arts 28-30 of the GDPR, to familiarise itself with such conditions when it hires another party (eg cloud service provider) to process the data on its behalf.

At the moment, tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.com are taxed on how much profit they make in the UK, but campaigners have often accused them of artificially reducing their profits so they can pay less tax. READ: The Budget as it happened Instead, the Chancellor wants to tax their revenues, a much larger figure which is harder to manipulate. Taxing anything other than profits is virtually unheard of, so the UK will be a pioneer of this model, with the international community, which is similarly frustrated by the lack of tax paid by the big tech firms, looking on closely. </p><p>His plan is to hit 'established tech giants' - those which are profitable and generate global revenues of at least 500mln a year - with a 2% tax on all sales that they make in the UK. Addressing Parliament, Hammond said: 'It is clearly not sustainable or fair that digital platform businesses can generate substantial value in the UK without paying tax here.' For example, Amazon paid 4.5mln in taxes to the UK government last year despite turning over almost 2bn. Under the new proposals, it would have to pay HMRC 40mln. Blue-chips targeted, not start-ups Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said the hike was 'not entirely immaterial' for the firms but also 'not really that meaningful' either. The UK is well-known for its thriving digital start-up community, particularly those in the fintech sector, and Hammond was at pains to reassure them that it would be the bigger players who 'shoulder the burden' of the new levy. 'The [500mln] threshold means this tax is aimed squarely at the likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and maybe a couple others,' Wilson noted. Assuming Parliament votes through the proposal - corporate tax is an issue which has attracted cross-party ire - the changes would come in to force in April 2020. For the 2019-20 tax year, the treasury has estimated that the tax will bring in an additional 275mln before gradually rising up to 440mln in 2022-23. Other governments to follow suit? 'A tax take of 400mln or so might seem a small number when you consider that Amazon alone is expected to post sales of US$233bn this year,' said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf. 'But the worry for the tech giants, and their shareholders, is that this is the pebble that starts an avalanche of taxes from international governments.' Both the 36-member Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission have been trying to agree how to tax social media platforms, internet marketplaces and search engines. They haven't had much joy in reaching a consensus yet, with Hammond describing progress as 'painfully slow', hence why he's decided to go it alone for the time being. The UK government has earmarked April 2020 as the likely start date for its regulations, although by that point, the Chancellor hopes that a global agreement on digital turnover tax will have been agreed. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-PAIN1135371540919188565251763300070</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PAIN-113537</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TM3-1C51-JCMN-Y3VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><timeReceived>5:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Proactive Investors</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 30, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009SZB</classCode><className>HARGREAVES LANSDOWN PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the mid-1960s, William Cannon and Dallis Perry, two psychologists, decided the \"two key profile characteristics\" of computer programmers were \"an interest in solving puzzles and a dislike of or disinterest in people.\" And so, a stereotype was born. </p><p>Cook, who holds a doctorate in clinical, educational, and health psychology from University College London, traces Silicon Valley's current dysfunctions to its early valorization of logic over social awareness and of analytical skill over emotional intelligence. A fundamental lack of empathy in the tech sector, Cook argues, has allowed Silicon Valley's most influential players to hoard consumer data and repurpose it as fuel for their hypercapitalist profit machines. Various social problems, she says, can be linked to this economic arrangement, including job displacement, a loneliness epidemic, diminishing privacy rights, housing shortages in the San Francisco area, political polarization, and the controversial Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom. This unique psychology-based approach to the digital economy is a valuable, scholarly achievement. Many other authors have made these same connections over the past few years, but Cook offers a meticulously well-sourced compilation of these critiques. Big tech has held tightly to a prosocial self-conception-so much so, Cook notes, that Facebook's \"move fast and break things\" motto takes on a new interpretation: \"Moving fast and breaking things in the name of growth has been accomplished to startling effect; unfortunately, what has been broken are communities, trust, and informed discussion, along with the evolution of a new brand of tribalism, which spreads more easily and is more difficult to immobilize.\" Ultimately, the author calls for increased regulation, systemic changes, and \"values reformation.\" Scholarship, timeliness, and an informed psychological perspective set this book apart from other Silicon Valley critiques.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publication Date: </emphasis>2019-10-04</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher: </emphasis>Palgrave Macmillan</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage: </emphasis>NonFiction</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISBN: </emphasis>978-3-03-027363-7</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Price: </emphasis>$23.00</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Author: </emphasis>Cook, Katy</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIRKUS-2000197887</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIRKUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y67-GRW1-JC8J-R168-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"365\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Kirkus Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kirkus Reviews (Print)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30101\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 15, 2020, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Anna Eshoo (DCalifornia), Zoe Lofgren (DCalifornia) and Suzan DelBene (DWashington) joined Sens. Richard Blumenthal (DConnecticut) and Mark Warner (DVirginia) to introduce a privacy bill addressing the use of technology to track the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Public Health Emergency Privacy Act (PHEPA) provides needed regulations on exposure-notification and contact-tracing applications whether built and deployed by state and local governments or by tech companies and other private-sector employers. These protections mandate that the use of these digital tools be voluntary; that information collected such as medical diagnoses and exam data, and location or proximity information be limited to what's necessary and proportionate to addressing the public-health crisis.</p><p>The bill bans commercial use of that information, and protects the civil rights of people who use these applications by preventing discrimination in access to public-facing businesses like stores, and other commercial establishments and public spaces, based on whether a person uses such an application or not.</p><p>Free Press Action Senior Policy Counsel Gaurav Laroia made the following statement:</p><p>\"There's an understandable desire to use state-of-the-art technology to combat the spread of COVID-19. Some of these technologies may prove effective in addressing this public-health emergency, but efforts to contain coronavirus shouldn't open the door to a more abusive and discriminatory surveillance system.</p><p>\"Governments and businesses across the world have begun deploying digital technology to trace people's movements and contacts to help stop the spread of the disease. Almost all of that information collection and tracking is unregulated here in the United States, opening the door to potential abuses. This bill would put many necessary protections in place to make sure the technology is used responsibly.</p><p>\"This bill makes it clear that we don't need to completely sacrifice privacy, data protection and civil rights to make these tools effective. And for them to work, a large majority of cellphone users would need to use them. Without PHEPA's protections to secure this information, people will be reluctant to use contact-tracing applications in the numbers needed to make the technology useful.</p><p>\"Unlike the proposal put forth by Senator Wicker and other Senate Republicans, PHEPA also protects workers from undue and unnecessary surveillance. Black and Latinx essential workers are bearing the brunt of this crisis while dying in disproportionate numbers. Digital tools may help keep them safe, but employers' use of these tools must be regulated. This crisis cannot turn already difficult working conditions into a pretext to deploy long-lasting and unnecessary worker surveillance.</p><p>\"If we've learned anything from experience with widespread data collection it's that stringent safeguards and oversight are necessary to prevent personal data from falling into the hands of those who seek to misuse it. The bill rightfully tightly ties this data collection to solving the public-health crisis and prevents using that information for commercial purposes. The bill also prohibits the unnecessary sharing of that data with law-enforcement agencies which would undermine the goal of widespread adoption, especially among the most vulnerable.</p><p>\"We've seen big tech companies mishandle data they collect from their users, exploiting it for purposes other than those they officially claim. Their promises to protect our essential information aren't enough. We need policies to limit data collection at its source, with clear restrictions and rules on what's being gathered, by whom, how it's being stored, how it gets used and for how long. PHEPA puts many of these vital safeguards in place.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123693032</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX4-3SX1-JCBF-S53R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 14, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Just ask anyone trying to sell automobiles in the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On January 1, 2020, the new (CCPA) went into effect with consequences felt far beyond the state's borders. This has lit a fire under Congress, where proposals for data regulation appear aimed more at punishing misconduct and negligence by Big Tech than at creating a data ecosystem that properly balances privacy, security, commerce and innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a shame. Designing such far-reaching legislation in the current atmosphere of fear and anger - not to mention during a U.S. election year - is a mistake. The result will be a punitive system that threatens huge fines for perceived violations of a somewhat difficult to interpret regulation, one that frankly doesn't add much to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law that has already forced global digital players to comply.</p><p>Worse still, it will stifle innovation without achieving its main goal: bringing greater security and privacy protections to the American public. The legalistic regulatory approach enacted in Sacramento and now contemplated in Washington, too, will simply spawn an ocean of legalistic disclaimers and opt-outs (along with the legal fees required to produce them) and launch a hunt by players small and large for the loopholes that invariably exist when laws are passed to win political points rather than after long, nonpartisan study aimed at finding optimal solutions.</p><p>Golden Opportunity</p><p>That California would be the beachhead for the regulatory campaign that began with the May 2018 enactment of GDPR in Europe is hardly surprising. Back in 2007, California's decision to set higher fuel efficiency standards than the rest of the US forced the rest of the world - not just US automakers, but foreign manufacturers, too, eager to sell cars in the United States - to scramble.</p><p>The powerful auto and energy lobbies tried to kill the move, but the Golden State's higher bar was affirmed by EPA in 2009 when it issued an exemption allow the state to exceed federal standards. That the Trump administration recently revoked this exemption matters little. It takes time and a lot of money to change production lines and auto designs, whether the change is meant to raise or lower fuel efficiency. As a result, the effects of California's higher standards are very likely to outlive the current administration.</p><p>This scenario is now playing out on data regulation. GDPR was the first shot: By dint of the EU's size, its new regulatory approach invariably forced compliance on many firms outside its borders. In simpler times, the EU's enactment of GDPR would have spurred trans-Atlantic talks to harmonize the legal codes of the world's two largest economic entities. But these are not simple times when it comes to data.</p><p>As readers of this site know by now, GDPR levies fines of up to 4% of annual revenue on companies doing business in Europe who fail to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens. This so far has cost companies over $100 million in legal and other fees, according to the European Parliament's data protection registry, including the rewiring of digital business plans and platforms, the hiring of \"Chief Data Officers,\" a relatively new post necessitated by the law, and other compliance measures. Google was hit quickly with a $57 million fine in 2018. In September 2019, British Airways took the dubious crown for the largest fine to date at $228 million.</p><p>California's state legislators, once incredibly pliant when it came to technology regulation due to the power of Silicon Valley lobbyists, have since 2016 joined the bandwagon of tech bashers - a vote-winning caravan in a largely Democratic state since the 2016 Facebook-Russia election fiasco. And as with the EU, it's size matters. California is not only the largest internal market in the US, but if it were a nation, its $2.9 trillion 2018 GDP would make it the fifth largest economy in the world, slotting in right between Germany (No. 4) and the UK (No. 6).</p><p>Rumblings back East</p><p>The confluence of data paranoia and California's history as a state that can make national policy will ensure that Congress, a notoriously Luddite institution, will now act. Suddenly, less than a month before the US presidential primary season begins, a rare bipartisan push towards federal data protection legislation has emerged aimed at forestalling a state-by-state patchwork and, for the GOP at least, denying vindication to reviled activist legislators of California.</p><p>Was a nonpartisan panel of experts convened? Has Congress examined the many proposals for digital sovereignty or third-party data protocols - including the one ? No. They held televised star chamber hearings to eviscerate the CEOs of the major technology firms without demonstrating much knowledge of the complexities involved. Did Facebook deserve its drubbing? Probably. Is the laissez faire approach that dominated the first two decades of the digital revolution in need of guardrails? Absolutely.</p><p>Now Congress is moving forward with a sledgehammer where an architect's fine pencil is more appropriate. In November, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-WA and the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, introduced a new national privacy bill - , - aimed at providing consumers with digital \"Miranda rights\" and impose tough penalties on companies that abuse consumer data.</p><p>So Republicans, eager to find some compromise that would prevent a patchwork of state laws like the CCPA from being enforced, have made . It dials back some of the disclosure requirements of Cantwell's bill, and also would preempt state data laws, a provision that would deny California the satisfaction of again setting national policy.</p><p>Everything in Moderation</p><p>I don't deny the downside risks or the need for standards. I could list the big hacks and point to outrages regarding personal privacy, but you know that story. All new technologies come with downside risk. Wheels, a seminal human invention, not only move things but also crushed us to death now and then. The printing press brought literacy and ideas to medieval civilization but also Mein Kampf and child pornography. Aircraft made the planet smaller but also dropped jellied petroleum on Dresden and atomic weapons on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.</p><p>We didn't ban wheels, printing presses or aircraft. The harnessing, sharing and selling of data will displace workers, prove invasive in some forms, and may well be turning our children into little Zombies. But humans manage risk and adapt to change: that's what we do. We will survive the challenges of the technology age, too.</p><p>For all the downside risks involved in the transfer and collection of data, I believe the upside is greater by far. Data on our health and nutrition will extend our lives; Data has the potential to eliminate traffic accidents. Data will make everything from buildings to ships to hospitals more sustainable and more efficient. Even inequality can be tackled: Data gleaned from mobile payments systems in the far reaches of the developing world shunned by traditional finance - from sub-Saharan Africa to the Andes to Southeast Asia - are enabling small farmers, merchants and village craftsmen to access small loans and insurance based on risk calculations drawn from shared data.</p><p>The data debate is complex.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IFMNGT-0000016f-e6b1-d3ca-ab7f-eff73d970001-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFMNGT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2V-S3W1-JCRW-52XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436967</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1233\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia, Inc.

For example, you have to stand against big government and state intrusions into individual lives, you have to support our constitutional framework and defend civil liberties, and you also have to uphold the rights of private property. Websites are indeed private property, as much as a person's home is private property. There is no such thing as free speech rights in another person's home, and there is no such thing as free speech rights on a website. </p><p>That said, there are some exceptions. When a corporation or a collective of corporations holds a monopoly over a certain form of communication, then legal questions come into play when they try to censor the viewpoints of an entire group of people. Corporations exist due to government sponsored charters; they are creations of government and enjoy certain legal protections through government, such as limited liability and corporate personhood. Corporations are a product of socialism, not free market capitalism; and when they become monopolies, they are subject to regulation and possible demarcation. Many corporations have also receivedextensive government bailouts[2](taxpayer money) andcorporate welfare[3]. Google and Facebook, for examplerake in billions in state and federal subsidies[4]over the course of a few years. Google doesn't even pay for the massive bandwidth it uses. So, it is not outlandish to suggest that if a company receives the full protection of government from the legal realm to the financial realm then they fall under the category of a public service. If they are allowed to continue to monopolize communication while also being coddled by the government as 'too big to fail', then they become a public menace instead. This is not to say that I support the idea of nationalization. On the contrary, the disasters of socialism cannot be cured with even more socialism. However, monopolies are a poison to free markets and to free speech and must be deconstructed or abolished. Beyond corporate monopolies, there is also the danger of ideological monopolies. Consider this - The vast majority of silicon valley companies that control the lion's share of social media platforms are run by extreme political leftists and globalists that are openly hostile to conservative and moderate values. Case in point: Three of the largest platforms on the internet - Reddit, Twitch, and YouTubejust acted simultaneously[5]in a single day to shut down tens of thousands of forums, streamers and video channels, the majority of which espouse conservative arguments which the media refers to as 'hate speech'. To be sure, at least a few of the outlets shut down probably argue from a position of race superiority. However, I keep seeing the mainstream media making accusations that all the people being silenced right now deserve it due to 'racism' and 'calls for violence', and I have yet to see them offer a single piece of evidence supporting any of these claims. A recent article from the hyper-leftist Salon is a perfect example of the hypocrisy and madness of the social justice left in action. It's titled'Twitch, YouTube And Reddit Punished Trump And Other Racists - And That's A Great Thing For Freedom'[6]. Here are a few excerpts with my commentary: Salon:'Freedom is impossible for everyone when viewpoints prevail that dehumanize anyone. And it appears that several big social media platforms agree, judging from recent bans or suspensions of racist accounts across YouTube, Twitch, and Reddit.' My Response Freedom cannot be taken away by another person's viewpoint. Every individual has complete control over whether or not they 'feel' marginalized and no amount of disapproval can silence a person unless they allow it to. If you are weak minded or weak willed, then grow a backbone instead of expecting the rest of the world to stay quiet and keep you comfortable. Remember when the political left was the bastion of the free speech debate against the censorship of the religious right? Well, now the leftists have a religion (or cult) of their own and they have changed their minds on the importance of open dialogue. Salon:'For those who are dehumanized \u2014 whether by racism, sexism, classism, ableism, anti-LGBTQ sentiment or any other prejudices \u2014 their voices are diminished or outright silenced, and in the process they lose their ability to fully participate in our democracy. We all need to live in a society where hate is discouraged, discredited and whenever possible scrubbed out completely from our discourse. This doesn't mean we should label all ideas as hateful simply because we disagree with them; to do that runs afoul of President Dwight Eisenhower's famous statement, 'In a democracy debate is the breath of life'. When actual hate enters the dialogue, however, it acts as a toxic smoke in the air of debate, suffocating some voices and weakening the rest.' My Response Where do I begin with this steaming pile of woke nonsense? First, it's impossible to be 'dehumanized' by another person's opinion of you. If they are wrong, or an idiot, then their opinion carries no weight and should be ignored. Your value is not determined by their opinion. No one can be 'silenced' by another person's viewpoint unless they allow themselves to be silenced. If they are right about you and are telling you something you don't want to hear, then that is your problem, not theirs. No one in this world is entitled to protection from other people's opinions. Period. It should not surprise anyone though that leftists are actively attempting to silence all dissent while accusing conservatives of stifling free speech. This is what they do; they play the victim while they seek to victimize. They have no principles. They do not care about being right, they only care about 'winning'. Under the 1st Amendment, ALL speech is protected, including what leftists arbitrarily label 'hate speech'. Unless you are knowingly defaming a specific person or threatening specific violence against a specific person, your rights are protected. Interpreting broad speech as a 'threat' because of how it might make certain people feel simply will not hold up in a court of law. Or at least, it should not hold up Political leftists have declared themselves the arbiters of what constitutes 'hate speech', the problem is they see EVERYTHING that is conservative as racist, sexist, misogynistic, etc. No human being or group of human beings is pure enough or objective enough to sit in judgment of what encompasses fair or acceptable speech. Therefore, all speech must be allowed in order to avoid tyranny. If an idea is unjust, then by all means, the political left has every right to counter it with their own ideas and arguments. 'Scrubbing' all opposing ideas from the public discourse is unacceptable, and this is exactly what the social justice movement is attempting to do. If you want to erase these ideas from your own home, or your personal website, then you are perfectly within your rights to do so, but you DO NOT have the right to assert a monopoly on speech and the political narrative. Generally, when a group of zealots is trying to erase opposing ideals from the discussion, it usually means their own ideals don't hold up to scrutiny. If your ideology is so pure and correct in its form, there should be no need to trick the masses into accepting it by scrubbing the internet. Finally, America was not founded as a democracy, we are a republic, and with good reason. A democracy is tyranny by the majority; a collectivist hell where power is centralized into the hands of whoever can con 51% of the population to their side. Marxists and communists love the idea of 'democracy' and speak about it often because they think they are keenly equipped to manipulate the masses and form a majority. But, in a republic, individual rights are protected REGARDLESS of what the majority happens to believe at any given time, and this includes the right to free speech. In the same breath, Solon pretends to value free discussion, then calls for the destruction of free speech and opposing ideas in the name of protecting people's thin-skinned sensitivities. In other words, free speech is good, unless it's a viewpoint they don't like, then it becomes hate speech and must be suppressed. Solon:'Reddit referred Salon to a statement explaining,'We committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate' and that 'ultimately, it's our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people.'#8217; My Response In other words, they don't like conservatives using their platforms against them, and since the political left is unable to present any valid arguments to defend their beliefs and they are losing the culture war, they are going for broke and seeking to erase all conservatives from their platforms instead. The 'hate speech' excuse is merely a false rationale. Social justice warriors stand on top of a dung heap and pretend it's the moral high ground. Solon:'No one who understands Constitutional law can argue that these corporate decisions violate the First Amendment which only protects speech from government repression. Professor Rick Hasen at the University of California, Irvine Law School told Salon by email that 'private companies running websites are not subject to being sued for violating the First Amendment. The companies are private actors who can include whatever content they want unless there is a law preventing them from doing so.' My Response Again, this is not entirely true. Corporations are constructs of government and receive special privileges from government. If corporations form a monopoly over a certain form of communication and they attempt to censor all opposing views from that platform then they can be broken up by government to prevent destruction of the marketplace. Also, government can rescind the limited liability and corporate personhood of these companies as punishment for violating the public trust. And finally, any company that relies on taxpayer dollars or special tax break incentives to survive can and should have those dollars taken away when attempting to assert a monopoly. Yes, there are alternative platforms for people to go to, but what is to stop leftist/globalist monopolies from buying up every other social media and standard media platform (as they have been doing for the past decade)? What is to stop leftist/globalist interests from using the 'hate speech' argument to put pressure on ALL other web platforms including service and domain providers to cancel conservatives? Finally, just because something is technically legal does not necessarily make it right. Corporations exploit government protection, yet claim they are not subject to government regulation? The left hates corporate America, yet they happily defend corporations when they are censoring conservatives? This is insane. The Salon author then goes on a blathering diatribe about how he was once a victim of racism (all SJWs measure personal value according to how much more victimized someone is compared to others). His claims are irrelevant to the argument at hand, then he continues Salon:'Trump threatening to use the government power to retaliate against those companies, on the other hand, is a threat to both the letter and the spirit of the First Amendment. He and his supporters are not being stopped from disseminating their views on other platforms' My Response Here is the only area where I partially agree with Salon. All of my readers know I do not put any faith in Donald Trump to do the right thing, mostly because of the elitists he surrounds himself with in his cabinet. When it comes down to it, Trump will act in THIER best interests, not in the public's best interests. Giving him (or the FCC) the power to dictate speech rules on the internet is a bad idea. Also, for those that think the election process still matters, what if we gift such powers to the government today and then the political left enters the White House tomorrow? Yikes! Then we'll have no room to complain as they will most certainly flip-flop and use government power to silence their opposition. Of course, if the roles were reversed and corporations were deplatforming thousands of social justice forums and videos, the leftists would be screaming bloody murder about 'corporate censorship' and 'discrimination'. For now, in their minds, racial discrimination = bad. Politicial discrimination = good. The monopoly issue still stands, though, and an ideological monopoly coupled with a unified corporate monopoly is a monstrosity that cannot be tolerated. Government can and should break up such monopolies without going down the rabbit hole of nationalization. Yes, we can go to small startup platforms and leave Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, etc. behind. I have been saying for years that conservatives with the capital should start their own alternative social media. In fact, that is exactly what is fianlly happening. There has been a mass exodus of users from mainstream websites lately. I say, let the SJWs have their echo chambers and maybe these companies will collapse. Get Woke Go Broke still applies. But, government can no longer protect these corporations, either. With the government raining down bailout cash and corporate welfare on media companies, voting with your feet and your wallet does not have the same effect or send the same message. The future of this situation is bleak. I have no doubt that leftists and globalists will attempt to purge ALL conservative discussion from the internet, to the point of attempting to shut down private conservative websites through service providers. The final outcome of the purge is predictable: Civil war; an issue I will be discussing in my next article. Leftists accuse conservatives of hate, but social justice adherents seem to hate almost everything. I don't think I've ever witnessed a group of people more obsessed with visiting misery on others, and they will never be satisfied or satiated. That which is normal speech today will be labeled as hate speech tomorrow. The cult must continue to justify its own existence. I for one am not going to live my life walking on eggshells around a clique of narcissistic sociopaths. Cancel culture is mob rule, and mob rule is at its core the true evil here; far more evil than any mere words spoken by any 'white supremacist' on any forum or video ever.If you would like to support the work that Alt-Market does while also receiving content on advanced tactics for defeating the globalist agenda, subscribe to our exclusive newsletterThe Wild Bunch Dispatch.

After all, cash is still king in daily life, even in extremely high-tech, innovative societies like Japan. Upon closer examination, though, current realities like Australia's proposed cash transaction ban for 2020, the continuing removal of higher denomination bills from several world economies, and the creation of centralized, state cryptocurrencies by governments worldwide cannot be ignored.  These trends signal a global push to kill paper money in the name of safety, security, and financial inclusion.You Can Pay, But It Better Be Our WayAustralia's 'Black Economy Taskforce' wants to put people accepting over 10,000 AUD (~$6,750) in cash in the slammer for up to two years, or fine them up to 25,000 (~$16,890), in an ostensible bid to fight black market economies. The Currency (Restrictions on the Use of Cash) Bill[2] 2019 states: Transactions equal to, or in excess of this amount would need to be made using the electronic payment system or by cheque. The Black Economy Taskforce recommended this action to tackle tax evasion and other criminal activities. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/india.jpgLong\">https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/india.jpgLong</url> lines of people wait to exchange their obsolete rupee notes in India.Note the similarity here with talking points of other governments. India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, when announcing the devastating surprise removal[3] of 86% of the country's circulating paper cash in 2016, proclaimed: Black money and corruption are the biggest obstacles in eradicating poverty. Not surprisingly, Modi's shock move put the dominantly cash-based society in a panic, forcing people to take their now worthless 1,000 and 500 rupee notes to banks within 50 days of the announcement, to exchange them for smaller denominations. Now The Royal Bank of India is moving to ban all cryptocurrencies but one, the state-approved, digital rupee[4].      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/500-dollar-bill.jpg500-dollar\">https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/500-dollar-bill.jpg500-dollar</url> federal reserve notes were officially discontinued in 1969.The removal of large cash bills is a worldwide, ongoing reality, with the European Central Bank (ECB) stopping production of the 500 euro note earlier this year[5]. The note, dubbed by the media as 'the Bin Laden,' was said to be used disproportionately in financing terrorism. The U.S. used to have banknotes worth $500 and higher as well, some which were known as gold certificates, entitling the bearer to physical gold upon redemption. As fractional reserve banking took over, however, and national debt increased, these systems were progressively abandoned. The trend continues today in the form of Negative Interest Rate Policy[6] (NIRP), and the resultant push for digitization of money.Stop Holding Cash and Take Our Debt'If everyone is holding cash, negative interest rates become useless.' These are the words[7] of former People's Bank of China (PBOC) governor Zhou Xiaochuan after the Chinese government had just completed a trial run of their new national cryptocurrency back in 2017. Now the country's sovereign digital currency is 'almost ready[8].' Zhou has also officially stated[9]: At the current stage, the central bank's major goal of issuing digital currency is to replace the physical cash. Earlier in the same interview, he maintained that 'The cost for cash transaction will gradually increase in the later stage. For instance, banks do not charge any fee for counting a large amount of coins now, but in the future they may charge their clients for such services.' Zhou's remarks about negative interest rates are arguably the biggest giveaway as to what is going on here. If people are holding cash outside of banks, reckless, Keynesian NIRP policies won't have the desired effect of coercing spending in the populace. New Zealand Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr agrees with Zhou: Let's tax cash holdings, simple as that: we're back to monetary policy as usual; people are disincentivised to be holding large lumps of physical cash; they are having to think harder about putting money to work.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shutterstock_1430077829-1.jpg\">https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shutterstock_1430077829-1.jpg</url> Big Tech: We'll Create the Digital Money, Thank YouWhile draconian government monetary policy is alarming, the lack of support for actual financial sovereignty in the crypto and tech space is indicative of another problem. Government's designs on eliminating paper money and fighting permissionless, decentralized crypto exchange \u2014 both moves to control money supply and populations of individuals \u2014 are obvious, and to be expected. But even big tech companies and exchanges like Facebook and Binance are jumping on the propaganda bandwagon, dragging many well-meaning enthusiasts into the fight against financial freedom (even if unintentionally) right along with them. 'We believe that we all have a responsibility to help advance financial inclusion, support ethical actors, and continuously uphold the integrity of the ecosystem.' - Libra whitepaper[10]Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace!Counter Markets Newsletter - Trends ...rategies for Maximum Freedom'This is why we believe in and are committed to a collaborative process with regulators, central banks, and lawmakers' - Facebook's David Marcus[11] 'Binance is looking to create new alliances and partnerships with governments, corporations, technology companies, and other cryptocurrency companies and projects involved in the larger blockchain ecosystem, to empower developed and developing countries to spur new currencies.' - Binance's 'Venus' announcement[12] The common theme here is eager compliance with Keynesian value destroyers. And these examples are illustrative of the true financial epidemic.Forced 'Perfection'Digital currencies really are extremely convenient. Everybody in the world really should have a chance at financial inclusion. Holding wads of paper cash and coins really can be a bother, as well as a safety hazard, where crime is concerned. In Finland[13], passengers on state railways won't be able to purchase tickets with cash for long-distance trips, starting in September. Much easier than messing with the paper stuff. ATMs are becoming less common[14] worldwide, even in countries like China, the U.S., and cash-obsessed Japan. Settlements and payments can be made effortlessly, though, with just a quick scan or entering a PIN, so it's no big deal. Text cryptocurrency to friends and family even without Internet (CoinText)[15] But this is not a perfect world. Governments are corrupt. Artificial monopolies and seas of red tape exist, keeping the life-threateningly impoverished and entrepreneurial from accessing crypto and banking services via strict KYC and AML policy, and by mandating, like Modi in India, that their hard-earned and hard-saved money is worthless. People already have the opportunity for extreme financial inclusion. A $40 smartphone and an internet connection enables anyone, anywhere in the world, to make or receive money with Bitcoin. In the name of regulation, safety, and financial inclusion, however, the state makes the situation more chaotic, less safe, and extremely exclusive where real human need is concerned. Some of us crazy people still like paper cash, and prefer to pay that way. Some annoying, behind-the-times Luddites still put money in their mattresses, where global financial policy turns more and more toward negative rates, continued inflation, and devaluation of money sitting in banks. Some entrepreneurs and tech-savvy fans of crypto simply think it's nobody else's damn business, preferring paper wallets, coin shuffling, and VPNs, in a world where everyone but those in power are presumed guilty until proven innocent. Some of us 'conspiracy nuts' just like crypto for crypto[16], and paper cash is still closer to that clean and private model than any slimy, centralized digital state currency could ever hope to be.

What can eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant do?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First you hear a car coming to a stop. Then you see a child's face appear on the screen. It's clear she's in the back seat, recording the video on her phone. You hear the brakes engage and the handbrake pulled. Two women get out of the front seats. One says, \"We'll be back in a sec, sweetie.\" The doors slam shut, and then you hear the child saying to a person on the other end of the phone, \"What do you want me to do?\"</p><p>Toby Dagg, head of a team of cyber investigators working in the office of Australia's eSafety Commissioner, is describing one online video he can't erase from his mind. Among the thousands of appalling images he has witnessed in his eight years in the job, he can't shake this one. \"The person is obviously conveying instructions to the girl in some way we can't see, likely by text,\" he says. \"They direct her to an adult pornographic website on her phone, and then say something along the lines of: 'Like that.' She turns her phone's camera towards her genital area, pulls aside her underpants and films herself. She quickly rearranges herself as the two adults come back to the car, get in and drive off. She would have been six or seven years old.</p><p>The whole thing took no more than 30 seconds.\"</p><p>Dagg's team came across the video on a paedophile website, but not before potentially hundreds of thousands of people saw it. The footage almost certainly came from the US, he says, judging by the accents, and the girl and the perpetrator were clearly in a pre-existing relationship. \"I often think about that clip. It's chilling in a number of ways,\" he says. \"How young she is. How quickly it all takes place. Where it takes place. The grooming and the ongoing undiscovered relationship with the abuser. And just how low the opportunity cost is for child sex abuse offenders in today's society.</p><p>They don't even need to be physically present to abuse a child with the technology available today.\"</p><p>Like all countries, Australia is grappling with how it can deal with the avalanche of such material in the virtual free-for-all of the mobile-enabled internet. But unlike other countries that leave it to NGOs such as the US-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to pursue these matters, Australia has the world's only stand-alone government-run online safety regulator, the eSafety Commissioner. At the helm is Julie Inman Grant. She arguably has one of the most important jobs in the country: leading an office charged with bringing some order to the mayhem and lawlessness of cyberspace in Australia.</p><p>In Pyrmont, on the western fringe of Sydney's CBD, is a nondescript modern office building.</p><p>Some floors are tenanted by property developers, another by a film company. But the fifth floor is a country mile from considerations of returns per square metre or weekend box office takings.</p><p>Despite the workaday streetscape, what is taking place on this floor of the Pyrmont office block is unique in the world, though countries from the UK to South Korea are looking to duplicate it.</p><p>Julie Inman Grant's office has a smog-diminished view through parkland treetops and north towards the harbour. If the trees' gentle sway invokes a languid calm, it doesn't permeate through the window. It's just after 9am but Inman Grant, a four times a week jogger, is already running hard. She greets me outside her glass-walled office overlooking a 60-strong staff scattered across one open-plan floor. As in many modern workplaces, screens rule and desk phones gather dust. But if I think it's just like any other office, just wait, she says. Just wait until I've spoken with Dagg, the head of the investigations team, or been to the secure room to talk with David, a 2m-tall former cop and one of his investigators, about the material they see in there. But for now Inman Grant holds court, explaining the functions of her office that, to the layman, seem mind-boggling in scope.</p><p>What started in 2015 as the Children's eSafety Commissioner has quickly expanded to regulate the online safety of all Australians. Its remit sounds almost Pollyanna-ish: to safeguard people from online harm, and to promote safer, more positive online experiences for children and adults. Practically, day to day, it's far darker work that examines complaints about serious cases of children being cyberbullied - harassed or humiliated online. It investigates complaints of child exploitation and abuse, including where children are groomed and duped into providing a sexually compromising image and then blackmailed for even more explicit material. It regulates image-based abuse (in layman's terms, revenge porn), in which a photo or video never meant to be shared ends up splashed across the internet without the subject's permission. And it deals with abhorrent violent content, which includes both child penetrative rape and terrorism, an example being the livestreaming of the Christchurch terrorist massacre last year in which 51 people were killed at two mosques. Despite new laws giving the eSafety Commissioner the power to order internet service providers to block websites hosting the material, the video still does the rounds on some of the web's darkest foreign-based sites.</p><p>The eSafety Commissioner has an investigation and an education function but doesn't prosecute criminal behaviour, leaving that to law enforcement. It works closely with police and ensures unacceptable content is taken down from online platforms including Facebook, Instagram and other more obscure sites as quickly as possible. In some but not all cases it has legal power to demand rather than persuade. A critical element is the office's relationship with major content providers.</p><p>Sometimes an approach to an online service about content their own compliance teams have missed will see material removed within 30 minutes.</p><p>Sometimes there is resistance. The remit is immense, and if the federal government has its way, it will become even bigger.</p><p>Inman Grant offers the seat with the harbour glimpse at a small meeting table in her office. On her desk are small pieces of artwork done by her three children, a 13-year-old girl and twin eight year-olds, one girl, one boy. She finishes her tea from a mug adorned with one of her children's faces. Two similar mugs sit on the desk. No favourites, she says. \"They aren't why I got into the world of online safety,\" she says of her children. \"I've been in this space for a long time. But they are definitely part of the reason I'm so passionate about it.\"</p><p>Seattle-born Inman Grant, 51, has worked at the intersection of cyber safety, public policy and technology since her early days in government relations for Microsoft. \"It was 25 years ago now that I helped organise the first online safety summit with the Clinton administration. My interest in the interface between social justice and online safety has been long held.\"</p><p>After the Clinton years in DC, she came to Sydney in 2000 to build Microsoft's profile with government and industry in Australia and New Zealand. Four months later, the course of her life changed. \"I was having coffee in my pyjamas in my courtyard when my future husband poked his head over the fence. He says, 'Hi. I'm staying at your neighbour's place and I've locked myself out.</p><p>I broke a window to get in and just wanted to let you know I'm not a robber.'\" This was the start of two decades of continent-shifting for the family, including another stint at Microsoft's head office in Washington State in a global privacy and safety role from 2009-12. \"I had my twins while we were in the US. And at that stage my husband had moved for me, so it was his turn, and we came back to Australia both because a job opportunity had opened up for him and because we made a considered decision to raise our children here.\"</p><p>In 2017, Inman Grant was working as a public policy executive for Twitter in Australia and New Zealand when she was snapped up by the federal government to be the second eSafety Commissioner. It's a small agency and she wears many hats - CEO, COO, chief strategist, ambassador but she is determined to remain at the coalface by seeing what is coming in through the complaints channels about cyberbullying and online child sexual abuse. \"I will see something almost every day. I don't feel I can adequately do my job and set the right strategies if I don't know what the victims are experiencing.\"</p><p>Every investigator who works in the space of online child sexual abuse will tell you there are one or two cases that stick with them, she says.</p><p>\"For me, it was 10 years ago when I saw some material Interpol had of a father penetrating an infant, less than one year old.\" The visual sits heavily in the room. Her voice wavers. \"This is still one of my biggest drivers, I always think of how we can do our best for the victims.</p><p>\"Seeing that image was no doubt an inflection point. My eldest was three at the time and in daycare. Through my job I knew that 99 per cent of child sexual assault perpetrators are men. There was a male child care worker there, who I knew was kind and good at his job. But even so I will admit that when I changed my daughter's diaper I would check her. And I would ask her to make sure she spent her time playing in a group of friends.</p><p>\"Even now, regardless of who I am, I know that my kids are vulnerable and that I can't be with them every minute of the day. All I can do is try to give them the clearest messages about online safety that I can, and to work as hard as I can in this role to ensure those prevention messages are getting to as many parents as possible.\"</p><p>She offers some numbers about what her office is up against. Its work is the finger in the dyke against the online harm of children, she concedes, pointing to a global threat assessment released in December last year that predicted a coming \"global tsunami\" of online child sexual abuse and exploitation. The report cited an Interpol report estimating an additional 1.8 million more men with a sexual interest in children will be using the internet in 2020 compared to a year ago, saying the number was almost certainly conservative. It noted just one publicly available website containing child sexual exploitation material had 6.5 million views in its first month of operation last year.</p><p>Feeding the increasing demand is a rapidly growing supply. The worldwide proliferation of highly sexualised images and videos created by children using mobile devices is the current trend that most disturbs Inman Grant. Children simply aren't capable of making mature judgments about the harm, she says, and in many cases may be acting on instruction and under duress. \"We are seeing the first generation of children capable of being sexually abused online. Sometimes we don't realise when we provide our children with internet-enabled devices and leave them unattended, we may be unwittingly inviting strangers into our own homes. As just one example, our team has dealt with a case where a young girl recorded herself emulating sex acts with a foreign object in her bathroom, while her parents' voices were clearly audible from the next room.\"</p><p>Are parents hearing you? \"Our research shows that parents are simply overwhelmed. They are using devices as a digital babysitter. Ninety-four per cent of Australian children have access to a digital device by age four. By age two, it is 42 per cent. While parents might think they have a handle on their child's use of Instagram or even Snapchat, you'd be surprised how many parents don't know that a gaming site like Fortnite pairs their child with 99 other players, and there is text and audio interaction accompanying that. Similarly with TikTok, which has a chat function. The internet has created a vast repository for predators to groom unsuspecting young people.\"</p><p>Rather than \"device denial\", she encourages parents to adopt an alert-not-alarmed approach and open dialogue within the family. On the premise that prevention is key, her office's website provides education, advice and information on online safety for parents, young people, children and even seniors. It works directly with schools, clubs and sporting associations. And recently it teamed with the children's TV show Play School, using Big Ted and Jemima to spread the online safety message.</p><p>But educating parents about online dangers is only one side of the ledger, I suggest. What about the responsibility of the tech companies to ensure they aren't hosting and profiting from illegal, offensive or harmful content? \"The default position of the tech industry is that it wants to be left alone by governments,\" says Inman Grant. \"There continues to be a fervent belief by industry that a completely unregulated environment is the best way to innovate and drive profits, as well as create jobs and maintain the sanctity of the First Amendment.\"</p><p>Communications minister Paul Fletcher agrees more needs to be done and calls on the tech industry to take more responsibility. \"Unfortunately the risks continue to evolve and some sectors of the internet industry have been slow to meet the community's expectations when it comes to online safety,\" he says. Fletcher is proposing new legislation to introduce faster mandatory takedown times by tech companies in response to a complaint (from 48 to 24 hours) and a new online safety charter that sets out government expectations of social media services, content hosts and other technology companies. One component includes giving the eSafety Commissioner power to request that internet companies report regularly on what they are doing to meet the government's online safety expectations. If a company fails to report, it will attract a penalty.</p><p>Our interview is just a small part of Inman Grant's day. Before lunch she will meet with Netflix about proposed content for a program it has commissioned called Clickbait, a thriller about a gruesome crime fuelled by social media.</p><p>Later she will meet with Twitter executives to cement relationships; then there is a series of HR meetings as she looks to recruit a key executive.</p><p>\"Go and see Toby,\" she says. \"He sees a lot. But pop by on your way out.\" On the far side of the office, Dagg's investigations team works behind frosted glass and security-coded doors. Other staff are denied access for their own welfare. Pot plants adorn the space, a botanical antidote to the heaviness of the atmosphere and an attempt to keep a psychological space between investigators. Screens are black while I'm here. A fussball table and a kids' basketball hoop are nearby, but both look little used.</p><p>Each morning, investigators are greeted with between 30 and 50 complaints from the public made via the commissioner's website, the majority involving images of child sexual abuse. Separate teams in the organisation handle claims of cyberbullying and image-based abuse.</p><p>I ask Dagg, a former NSW police officer who has spent most of his 17-year career in the field of juvenile justice and child protection, if Inman Grant's theory about one piece of footage staying with you applies to him. He says two spring to mind; the first was the little girl filming herself in the car. His second is more prosaic but no less disturbing. \"A complaint came in about a person on Instagram live-streaming himself masturbating while holding up images of young girls. We couldn't catch that act, it wasn't recorded, but on his account was other footage of concern to us. It was of a child in a school uniform, about 13 years old, walking and talking into her phone. He's clearly filming her through her phone. You could see her walk through her front gate into her house.</p><p>You could easily have worked out where it was.</p><p>\"While there was nothing else on that video, it obviously raised worries about the security of the child. In that case we notified Instagram and law enforcement, which was the most effective response we could identify, and it led to the account being removed. Instagram notified the international authorities, who were able to act quickly.\"</p><p>In the 2019 financial year the team finalised almost 12,000 investigations into child sexual abuse material, leading to the removal of about 70,000 images and video. Even so, the investigators admit that it feels like they are barely touching the surface, given the amount of content they see each day. They work for the small wins, for the victims, for the girl walking into her house unknowingly being filmed by a creep. They know the research shows the longer an image of child sexual abuse remains online, the greater the emotional damage to the victim. Knowing an image may remain online forever is itself retraumatising for victims.</p><p>But what of the trauma to the investigators themselves? What does it take to sit there and see this material day in day out? David, the former policeman turned investigator who prefers to keep his surname private, is philosophical. \"There is real satisfaction when a piece of content is taken down. You do think to yourself, 'We are removing a kid from harm's way',\" he says. \"But it can be frustrating when an image you have seen before reappears in a different online location.</p><p>That's when it feels a bit like whack-a-mole.\"</p><p>Staff have self-care plans. They see a psychologist every three months. \"We look after each other,\" says David. \"We have interviews just to see how it's going. We are encouraged to self-manage. If it gets too distressing we just walk away for a while.\"</p><p>I drop in to the office of Kellie Britnell, senior education outreach officer. The education component is a key plank of the commissioner's office and its materials include information for parents and educators, young adults and seniors on how to navigate their cyber experience more safely. For seniors the information can be as simple as how to pay for things safely online, or how to ensure passwords are protected. The commissioner also trains people to go into schools to provide e-safety information and advice to students.</p><p>\"Online safety permeates so many parts of society,\" Britnell says. \"One example that springs to mind is advice to young teachers about navigating their online relationships with students. While it is fairly obvious advice to not 'friend' a student on a social media platform, we've had to look more recently at other areas, for instance that teachers should not 'game' with students as part of a professional boundary issue.\"</p><p>A growing element of the commissioner's work is a service for people under 18 to report cyberbullying. More than 500 complaints were made last financial year, a 30 per cent spike from the previous year. Inman Grant says one of the more disturbing recent trends is the falling average age of those being cyberbullied - the highest number of complaints involved 13-year-olds.</p><p>Children made the majority of approaches to the commissioner, though a significant proportion came from parents. The most common complaint was serious name-calling and nasty online comments, followed by offensive or upsetting pictures or videos, and fake accounts or impersonation.</p><p>The office provides children with tools such as instructions on how to block, delete and report unwanted material, and it works directly with schools to resolve complaints in the most serious of cases. Children are then directed to mental health support services such as Kids Helpline.</p><p>In Inman Grant's office later that afternoon we talk about the future. Where can the big gains be made in the protection of people online?</p><p>What might success look like? What would failure mean? A key issue yet to be resolved is end-to-end encryption, she says. Huge volumes of direct messages on social media remain undetectable by authorities, raising the threat of unmonitored grooming and child sexual images going undetected. Facebook's What'sApp and Apple's iMessage are fully encrypted and can't be monitored; Facebook Messenger has optional encryption and must make mandatory reports of exploitation and abuse to US authorities. It is proposing a move to full encryption.</p><p>Inman Grant says the large online platforms are putting money ahead of online safety and the cost is \"the detritus of abused children left behind\".</p><p>\"Facebook will say it can't do anything. Technically it could scan for child sexual images before they are posted. Facebook says it is working on this but the technology will be another two years away. That isn't good enough. That said, it's not just Facebook. All platforms need to do better.</p><p>Microsoft, Apple, they all have culpability.\"</p><p>One of Inman Grant's online safety mantras is \"safety by design\", which she sees as a potential game-changer. She is leading the world on the issue, working with big tech companies to ensure new products, tomorrow's Fortnite or TikTok, have online safety \"baked in\" to the original design rather than being tacked on afterwards.</p><p>\"We almost take for granted the built-in safety design features of a car, such as seatbelts and airbags,\" she says. \"Shouldn't we expect that the technology companies systematically deploy virtual seatbelts to protect our children from the darkest recesses of the web?\"</p><p>Inman Grant couches the future in the language of war - a crusade, a campaign. \"Make no mistake,\" she says. \"We are in an arms race against the worst of the worst, who are adept at using technology for their own ends. We have to arm our citizens with the best possible skills and information to minimise the risk, and where there are harms, to do our best to minimise them by being as efficient as we can in our takedown efforts.</p><p>\"I can imagine success. Ultimate success would be doing myself out of a job. It would be the next generation learning about online safety from the start and throughout their educational journey. It would be the tech companies embracing safety by design so their platforms became so good at ferreting out abuse that we wouldn't need a regulator. But there's always the human factor. I know we'll never be totally rid of child sexual abuse or serious cyberbullying. Humans are too predictably imperfect. So if we can harden the target and make the internet a more inhospitable place for paedophiles and other abusers, that's practical success.\"</p><p>And failure? \"There's a really high societal cost if we don't get ahead of this,\" says Inman Grant.\"The worst-case scenario is losing lives, losing quality of life. The quality of lives of our kids is at stake, it is nothing short of that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AustralianMagazine20200208Main12000417899096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y56-VJS1-F0JP-W51G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Magazine</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 8, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tariffs and tiaras. The Queen welcoming President Trump to the U.K. as the Mexicans arrive in the United States battling to avoid tariffs as a result of migrant flows. And is it second time unlucky? Google may be facing a second U.S. antitrust investigation. It's Monday, let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, once again to the show and of course, it's the first trading day of June, lots going on in the show today as I mentioned there, including the fact that President Trump is of course in the U.K. and meeting with the Queen. We've got plenty of pomp and pageantry coming up in just a couple of minutes' time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I want to bring you back here to the global markets to the New York Stock Exchange where it's the President's alter ego, the so-called tariff man that's currently occupying the minds of businesses and investors alike. Right now, futures are low. We've got the NASDAQ off around a quarter of a percent premarket.</p><p>We've taken back some of the earlier losses watching U.S.-Mexico trade talks today, well, talks not on trade, but on tariffs. The U.S. saying it's ending its special trade status for India as well, of course last week, and apparently the President discussed imposing tariffs on Australia last week, too. Clearly, that didn't happen. But all of the United States' trading partners right now must be on higher alert.</p><p>Let's not forget China as well. In a press conference yesterday, on Sunday, Chinese officials saying look it was the United States fault, front and center, that we saw those trade talks breakdown. We are of course, still waiting for their corporate blacklist, too. This is taking a toll on markets.</p><p>What can I tell you? We've got the NASDAQ right now approaching correction territory, off almost 9 percent from that last month's record high. Chip stocks, too, have been severely punished. We've got the Dow now falling for some six straight weeks. It's also taking a toll in the bond markets, too.</p><p>The 10-year yield today has been close to breaking 2.1 percent. The warnings, too from the big banks coming thick and fast. Among them, Morgan Stanley warning that we could be less than a year away from a global recession if the trade war worsens. We will be talking this through throughout the show.</p><p>But for now, the President is royally occupied over in London and Hala Garani is there for us, too. Pomp, ceremony and controversy, Donald Trump has only been in London for a few hours, but we've already had plenty of three. Hala Gorani outside Buckingham Palace for us. Hala, great to have you on the show with us. Talk us through what we're seeing so far.</p><p>HALA GORANI, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well, you mentioned the pomp and the ceremony, but there were insults and they began flying before the plane had even landed.</p><p>Donald Trump has begun his first ever state visit to Britain. You'll remember last year in July, he also visited the U.K.; that was a working visit. Now, a short time ago, the U.S. President sat down for a private lunch with the Queen after a formal reading ceremony at Buckingham Palace.</p><p>Well, there were no warm greetings for London Mayor though, not long before Air Force One touched down. The president sent out a tweet calling Sadiq Khan, a stone cold loser. He also made fun of his height. This after the Mayor slammed Mr. Trump in a scathing editorial calling him an example of a global far right threat.</p><p>CNN's Nic Robertson joins me now with more. So today is a very, very busy day for the President. Today is royal day, tomorrow is politics day. We'll talk about that them. But right now, we expect the next event to be what?</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: After the lunch is finished here, then they will go and review gifts. These are gifts that former U.S. Presidents, U.S. officials, dignitaries have given to the Queen over the years. These are held in the Royal Collection, one of the things that they might be able to see, in fact, I think we can expect President Trump to be shown a copy of the Statement of Independence from Britain over 200 years ago. But it's things of that stature that he'll be shown.</p><p>[09:05:10] ROBERTSON: This is again to sort of talk about the history and the strength of the relationship, and that it goes back many, many generations.</p><p>GORANI: Well, the U.S. President did not shy away from some might even say, meddling in U.K. politics by having kind words for Boris Johnson though perhaps he hasn't been reminded that Boris Johnson once said some not very nice things about him, and also engaging in this Twitter war of words with the London mayor. Telling \"The Sun\" political editor in an interview from the Oval Office, he didn't know Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's wife was nasty. What a controversy, which we've come to expect.</p><p>ROBERTSON: We have and outside of the Meghan Markle question, which was something President Trump has later said that he didn't actually say, but it was there on tape and he did say it and it was to the editor as he was speaking to him before, Tom Newton Dunn who had told the President, reminded him that Meghan Markle during President Trump's election campaign, that if he got elected, then she would emigrate to Canada. So that's what he was commenting on. He was trying to make up for it.</p><p>But the issues of Boris Johnson, of Sadiq Khan, of dissing in a way, Theresa May's own handling of Brexit, the things we saw when the President came here on that working visit last year, and he tried to make it up with Theresa May when he saw her after those comments became public, but it is par for the course. And I think that's what people here have expected.</p><p>His Twitter spat with, the Mayor of London goes back to after one of the terror incidents in London. He criticized the way that the mayor was handling that. He seems to want to take it all on and do this again.</p><p>And it diverts from some of the more substantive issues that he will be talking about while he is here.</p><p>GORANI: And there will be very substantive issues that the U.K. cares about deeply after Brexit. Because if they are -- and they are moving away from the closest of relationships with the rest of Europe, which is being part of the same E.U. club, they're going to have to develop some special - - even more special relationships with the U.S.</p><p>ROBERTSON: One of the strengths of being in the European Union is you're part of those 28 countries, 500 million people made up of all those nations. This is a powerful trading group that has clout around the world.</p><p>As Britain alone, you like that clout. So you're more exposed to the leverage that the United States might put on Britain to, for example, take certain products from the United States or want access to markets in the U.K. There was a discussion over the weekend that, you know, Britain's health service could be opened up to U.S. medical interests in a way that it isn't today.</p><p>But that would be a concern for British people, because they have some pride in what is a somewhat decrepit health service, but it is free to the user, and that's not the case in the U.S., that would be a concern.</p><p>So these will be some of the topics coming up. But there will be a lot of businesses leaders that the President will be bringing with him that the British government is hosting as well, and this will be an important part of the conversation.</p><p>GORANI: Right. Some big business leaders, banking industry leaders, pharmaceutical industry leaders as well taking part.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Military industry, yes.</p><p>GORANI: Thanks very much, Nic Robertson, we'll see you in a little bit. Jeremy Hunt was the first Minister to greet the U.S. President on his arrival.</p><p>The Foreign Secretary told Mr. Trump that Britain will be putting on a great show this week to celebrate the \"amazing partnership,\" quote, unquote, between the two nations.</p><p>But speaking to CNN, the Foreign Secretary conceded that there are some big differences between the two allies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEREMY HUNT, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: But we don't agree with everything he says or does. We don't agree with, for example, his approach to climate change or the Iran nuclear deal. I've disagreed with him on the NHS before, but that doesn't mean that we can't celebrate the fact that this is one of the most important alliances in history.</p><p>And it's not just about Britain and America did in the Second World War, is the international order that we created since then that has led to unparalleled peace and prosperity across the world. And in that, President Trump stands rock solid with the United Kingdom.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Well, Peter Westmacott is a former U.K. Ambassador to the United States, and he joins me now. So let's talk a little bit of just about the first few hours and perhaps even the hours preceding the President's touchdown at Stansted Airport outside of London. Already controversy there preceding the U.S. leader.</p><p>PETER WESTMACOTT, FORMER U.K. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: I think everybody knew that once the President of the United States -- this President of the United States was on his way or about to land, there were going to be tweets, there was going to be stories, there was going to be some sort of high risk stuff.</p><p>One or two British politicians who are going to be in London have taken the opportunity to be critical of the visit, critical of him. The nature of the President is that he fires back. And of course, if he was going to give interviews which he did a day or two beforehand to a couple of the Murdoch newspapers, it was inevitable that he will get involved in British domestic politics. That's par for the course, nobody is really surprised.</p><p>[09:10:06] GORANI: Right. No one is surprised, but what is significant then about this particular visit? Because this is post Brexit referendum Britain, and they know that their interests lie in developing closer relationships, even with traditional allies like the United States, but the President is talking about a trade deal that would involve access to the U.K. market even say for pharmaceutical goods. That may be some people in Britain wouldn't be comfortable with.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: I think you're right, Hala. We have to remember that this State Visit goes back to the day when Theresa May rushed off to the Oval Office, to be the first person to congratulate the President on his election. And he had been saying Brexit is wonderful, and thanks to Brexit and the President, and he has been very supportive of Brexit.</p><p>Now, we haven't done Brexit yet. Who knows? We might not even do it. It remains to be seen. It's extremely messy. He carries on talking about shiny, new free trade deals between Britain and America.</p><p>But most of us who've done free trade negotiations know that it's much more difficult than that. It will take a long time and there will be some seriously difficult negotiations over I think long time, whether it's chlorine washed chicken, beef hormones, financial services, American by America Act, or state procurement policies in America. This will be difficult.</p><p>So it's nice to hear that he wants Brexit to be a success. But you know, I'll believe it when I see it.</p><p>GORANI: And this will be the U.K. on its own and not as part of the E.U. Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, both men who are proponents of Brexit, of a hard Brexit were complemented by the U.S. President as being good leaders, and in the case of Nigel Farage, even saying he should be part of the negotiations.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: I saw that, too. And, of course, Boris said a little bit earlier, he was extremely rude about the President when he was the candidate.</p><p>GORANI: He called him unfit.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: Unfit for office. But he seems now to be very popular. For whatever reason, I don't know, he is being very complimentary, of course, about this President and he is a hardline Brexiteer, or he is for the moment until he is not. So we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>But I think it's inevitable if this President is asked, \"What do you think about the candidates for the race?\" There's a dozen of them out there. It's hard for him not to answer the question to say which one he likes.</p><p>GORANI: Now, as far as the U.K. is concerned, I mean, this has been -- this honor has been bestowed on only three Presidents. I wonder why the U.K. felt the need, in your opinion, for such a lavish welcome ceremony because this is as incredibly lavish as it gets.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: It is lavish. It is the full State Visit. I was Ambassador in Paris when we did the same thing with President Sarkozy. We went over to Buckingham Palace in the same way. We didn't have a helicopter on the lawn. But otherwise, it was very similar and it's spectacular.</p><p>And I like to think we do these things beautifully. Why? Answer: Theresa May really wanted to make him this offer on day one. Normally, to be honest, you wait and see how the relationship goes. You wait and see how the President performs before you issue an invitation to something as lavish and as important as this.</p><p>As you rightly say, not every President gets a State Visit. But this was promised and this President, even though he was here for a mini visit, last year, clearly wanted the full works, too.</p><p>GORANI: Right. We are expecting by the way a gift review to take place. It was meant to be done in private, but we understand we will be getting live images of that. Peter Westmacott, former U.K. Ambassador to the United States, always a pleasure. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>Julia, back to you at the New York Stock Exchange. And we'll bring those live images to you when the event takes place in Buckingham Palace behind us. Back to you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Gifting is definitely going to be a high point. I hope we do get to see those pictures and we will come back to you if we get them, Hala. Thank you for that. All right, for now though, let's bring it back to what we're seeing right now.</p><p>Futures pointing lower, as the trade at war heats up. Talks, of course between the United States and Mexico taking place today. This in light of the threat from President Trump to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports, if they don't do something to tackle migrant flows into the United States.</p><p>Christine Romans joins us now live. Christine, we can talk about Mexico, but it's not just Mexico. We have the Chinese overnight saying, look, it was the United States that blew the trade deal, not us. We have the reports of potential tariffs on Australia, too.</p><p>I mean, we thought the President was choosing his battles here with China and there's all sorts of battles erupting, left, right and center.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Erupting -- the President igniting the fuse in each and every one of those, too, so it shows you this is a White House that feels confident that it can fight trade wars on multiple fronts opening new fronts all the time.</p><p>\"The New York Times\" -- the front page of \"The New York Times\" this morning has a Maggie Haberman story about how the White House was considering putting tariffs on Australian aluminum. You know, there was an exemption that was granted by the President now thinking about maybe taking that away.</p><p>So all of these things rattling investors, although I will say my gut is telling me you could see maybe some nibbling here today because you've got major stock market averages in the U.S. down 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent for the NASDAQ last month. Really kind of really rough month.</p><p>So I think that you just watch to see what kind of volatility we see here today, but this is what we're hearing from the White House.</p><p>[09:15:06] ROMANS: Mick Mulvaney, the President's acting Chief of Staff on Fox News Sunday, essentially saying that no, the rules of economics don't apply in the Trump economy. American consumers will not feel tariffs and they are confident of that. And they're going to keep going forward. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We put tariffs on China, we're putting tariffs on Mexico, and inflation is still under control. American consumers have gone to products that are made in the United States, for example, that don't carry those tariffs. We think the same thing will happen here, and American consumers will not pay for the burden of these tariffs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Well, I mean, tell that to anybody trying to buy a car. I mean, Deutsche Bank says that if you have tariffs on Mexican imports, and whenever you have a risk of global auto tariffs; that will raise the price of a car. There are supply chains that are not as simple as Mick Mulvaney is making it sound that crisscross these borders.</p><p>So it's not as cut and dry as he says it is. But they are holding firm that, you know, tariffs are not a bad thing in Trump world.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's fascinating, isn't it? I think we're confusing the short term impact, which is that U.S. companies pay those tariffs in order to import those goods versus the medium to longer term if companies do decide not to manufacture in China, to do it elsewhere and ship them in from another country that then will hurt China.</p><p>But you've got to keep the timings here, front and center. And right now, it is the United States that pays these tariffs. I mean, to your point, what we've seen now is banks falling over themselves to lower their growth estimates to say that the Federal Reserve is going to kick in here and be cutting rates, maybe two times, maybe three times.</p><p>Jay Powell front and center this week, I think what he says this week about the trade impact, and perhaps whether or not he signals that they're more worried than they have been will be critical, I think for markets this week.</p><p>ROMANS: I think you're absolutely right. And don't forget, we end this week with the jobs report. I mean, is all of this tariff talk and tariff man running the United States, you know, the President -- as the President of the United States, as he has called himself, is that cooling hiring enthusiasm?</p><p>We have seen a very strong jobs market. Are we going to see that maybe taper off here? I will say one thing, the trade hawks around the President for a year now have been telling me that the U.S. economy is so strong, and inflation so benign, that this is exactly the time to make a big move on trade vis-a-vis China in particular.</p><p>Now, this move on the border using trade as leverage on the border is very new. It's a very new tactic and very concerning for a lot of people who watch the economy. You know, they want trade to be about trade. They don't want it to be about other issues, but that's clear what the President is making it here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the firm politicization of tariffs here and not just to tackle trading balances. Christine, great point. Christine Romans joining us there.</p><p>So actually, I said the tariffs and tiaras, but it's tariffs, tantrums and tiaras. I changed my mind on that.</p><p>All right, let's move on. We're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but -- so when we come back, Boeing, issuing a wing warning. How the plane maker's 737 problems just went from bad to worse.</p><p>Plus, going after Google. The U.S. Justice Department gearing up to investigate the search engine giant on antitrust grounds. We've got all the details next. Stay with us. You're watching CNN.</p><p>[09:21:31] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a quick look at what we're seeing right now for U.S. stock market futures.</p><p>It is the first trading day of the month, the first trading day of the week to a bit of pressure that we have taken back earlier losses. The NASDAQ, the tech stocks looking at the softness right now, down some three tenths of 1 percent.</p><p>We are seeing the flight to quality continue not only in the bond markets of course with yields under pressure, but also in the currency markets, too.</p><p>Take a look of what we're seeing across the board here. The Swiss franc currently trading at two-year highs versus the euro, a notable one. The dollar also strengthening despite the pressure that we've seen on bond yields, too.</p><p>It's also a key week for U.S. data. We've got manufacturing survey numbers out in less than an hour's time. We've got the jobs report, as that Christine Romans was mentioning out on Friday.</p><p>GM and Walmart are holding their Annual Shareholder Meetings. They are going to update investors on the risk of tariffs, of course, and the impact on pricing. And we've got the Fed beginning a two-day conference on monetary policy talks tomorrow with Jay Powell speaking. So lots to watch this week.</p><p>For now though, let's move on because we have more bad news from Boeing firm. The firm is warning that some 737 jets may have defective wing parts, and it's not just about the 737 MAX, but other new generation 737 planes as well.</p><p>You've got the regulators and Boeing telling airlines now to ground the planes with faulty parts until they are replaced. The question is how long will that take?</p><p>Oren Liebermann joins me now. Oren, the news goes from bad to worse for Boeing. Another challenge. Talk us through what we learned as a result of these faulty parts.</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So the part we're talking about specifically was known as a slat track. A slack is a part, a movable part of the front edge of a wing that comes out and improves airflow at low air speeds, generally.</p><p>The slat track is simply the two railings on which that part moves forward and back. And that's what we're talking about with this latest issue.</p><p>The FAA says some of these are defective and need to be inspected and repaired within 10 days. It affects quite a number of aircraft, 312 aircraft worldwide according to the FAA, as well as 65 in the U.S. that includes both the 737 MAX that have been such a focus lately, as well as the 737 NG, the new generation. So there are a number of airplanes affected here.</p><p>This is however relatively a minor issue. The FAA says it'll take 10 days or it should be fixed and inspected within 10 days. So the problem is not major. The FAA says it can't take down an airplane, it can however damage an airplane slightly.</p><p>The bigger issue is however exactly what you said it is, it is another question of doubt, another hit to the public confidence not only in Boeing, but also in the 737 aircraft. Now not only as we've said the 737 MAX but also the 737 NG and that is the major hit here as Boeing has been struggling trying, working to get the 737 MAX back in the air after the Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian Air crash -- that is the bigger story here.</p><p>Another hit to Boeing's confidence -- that and there's another issue here, Julia, an even bigger issue and that's the question of will the world's airline regulators -- aviation regulators -- work in lockstep as they have? Or are we about to see a break here?</p><p>We could very well be looking at a situation where the FAA says, yes the 737 MAX is ready to go back into the air and the European say, no way. We want a few more tests. We have a few more questions and that in and of itself would be stunning.</p><p>On top of that, the Chinese may also say the same thing. We want more time. We want more tests.</p><p>[09:25:05] LIEBERMANN: The difference is, in the Chinese case with the trade war looming, their questions maybe of a political nature instead of an aviation nature -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And Boeing has really got no defense at this stage. Huge, huge challenges. Oren Liebermann, thank you so much for that update there.</p><p>All right, let's move on. Another stock we're watching is Alphabet. It is sinking around 3 percent premarket on reports that the U.S. Justice Department is preparing to launch an antitrust investigation with a particular focus on the search business, but also advertising practices.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins us now. Paul, this is fascinating because the sentiment shift in the United States since the last time they were investigated has been huge. Walk me through what's the focus of this investigation, potentially, if we see it launched?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, as CNN's Brian Fung has reported, it does look as if the DOJ is preparing some sort of antitrust probe of Google on or Alphabet, focusing on the search and advertising side.</p><p>Remember, Julia, Google also owns YouTube. It owns the massive, you know ad agency, Double Click as well. So there's a lot of moving parts at Google. And this is a company that has become dominant along with Facebook, in search and online and mobile advertising.</p><p>And what I find fascinating is that obviously, President Trump has been very critical of the tech giants, including Amazon as well, particularly because of Jeff Bezos' personal ownership of \"%he Washington Post.\"</p><p>But I think that any criticism of big tech companies for how wide ranging they have become and the big businesses they dominate, that would have buy in from Democrats as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, we shall see. Thank you so much. Paul La Monica on that. We will watch it at the open. The market open is next. Plenty more to come. Stay with us. You're watching FIRST MOVE.</p><p>GORANI: An extensive coverage of U.S. President Donald Trump's State Visit to Britain. We'll get back to Julia in a moment. Here at Buckingham Palace, the Queen has just presented the President with an extensive collection of objects and artifacts to mark the occasion of this State Visit.</p><p>Among other gifts, the President was given a First Edition of Winston Churchill's book, \"The Second World War.\"</p><p>[09:30:06] GORANI: Remember Churchill was the one who first coined the term, \"the special relationship.\" So that gift has huge symbolic weight for both countries.</p><p>Now, what is happening now is that the -- Her Majesty, the Queen, and Prince Charles and Camilla, you can see them there as well inside Buckingham Palace are being presented with a series of objects.</p><p>The formal gift exchange will happen a little bit later. That is a special event. Nic Roberson is here with more. What is the Queen showing President Trump and First Lady, Melania.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Well, it just appears as if they've been looking at a colored engraved portrait of George Washington. They will be looking at a copy of the Declaration of Independence. Other pictures of George III, letters that have been exchanged, important historical letters.</p><p>But I'm noticing a couple of very interesting items coming up that will be things that President Trump will -- that are clearly being put out, particularly for President Trump that perhaps other leaders wouldn't see.</p><p>Remember President Trump's mother brought him up to respect the Queen. She liked the Queen. She was from the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, the remote islands off the Northwest Scottish Coast.</p><p>There he will be shown a picture of a standing stone. This is symbolic in the Outer Hebrides, but from very close to where his mother grew up, and also the MacLeod Tartan, The Book of Tartans will be open to the MacLeod Tartan, and his mother was a MacLeod.</p><p>So there is clearly an effort here to show the President things that will mean something specifically to him, some of the Queen's prized items, yes, that show the connection between -- sorry, a connection between Britain and the United States, but things that will, I'm sure she will hope that will please President Trump.</p><p>GORANI: Or more specifically related to the history of Donald Trump's family on his mother's side. On his father's side, the family is of German heritage. And this is separate from the gift exchange in which the U.K. will then give a gift to Donald Trump, the President and vice versa. Correct?</p><p>ROBERTSON: Correct. This is -- these are things that have been gifted to the Royal Family that they have collected over the centuries and this is something that President Trump is now being shown and this is quite normal. When the Queen hosts somebody on a State Visit, this is often something that that she would like to do that is traditional to do that she will give them an insight into, you know, into the ties between the two countries.</p><p>Again, it speaks to those issues. So this is obviously where Buckingham Palace has been renovated. She doesn't have full access to show him all the room she might normally like to do during a State Visit.</p><p>But this will really give him a flavor of how close the United States and Britain has been over the centuries.</p><p>GORANI: Of course, it's a visit that is not without controversy. We'll get to that in a moment. But right now, of course, this is a state visit. This is the highest honor that the U.K. can bestow upon a visiting Head of State.</p><p>I was speaking with Sir Peter Westmacott who is the former U.K. Ambassador to the U.S. He described how Nicolas Sarkozy was welcomed here on his State Visit.</p><p>Before Donald Trump, of course, Barack Obama was and George W. Bush. In this case, you were mentioning Buckingham Palace, parts of it are being renovated. And so therefore the President that is the reason the President is overnighting at Winfield House, which is the residence of the U.S. Ambassador.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Which is a very beautiful residence and it's a prime location. It's something that the American, the United States has had for a long time now, but in this -- but, you know, obviously, for President Trump, it perhaps would have been very nice to be able to stay one day in his memoirs that he stayed at Buckingham Palace. This has always been something that's very important to him.</p><p>GORANI: I am just sorry to jump in, I just noticed Ivanka Trump there in the background and her husband, Jared Kushner. Also Prince Charles and Camilla, both present at this particular event. It's 2:33 p.m., London Time and John Bolton I'm being told. I have not seen him, but John Bolton I'm being told is also part of this and talk to us about some of these objects as well because you mentioned the Tartan, The Book of MacLeod. Other artifacts as well?</p><p>ROBERTSON: Well, there's a book of Birds of America, Volume I, the Bird of Washington, that's an eagle, the water color of the bald eagle. The Natural History of the Carolinas, Florida and Bahamas Islands open up the page of the red cardinal.</p><p>They will they be looking at Joseph Farington's account of George III and Benjamin West conversation about George Washington. All of these items are what will have a special relevance, a special moment in history and the relationship between the two countries. These books open at certain pages, like the Book of his mother's Tartan. She was from Scotland, a MacLeod Tartan.</p><p>[15:35:08] ROBERTSON: His mother was as MacLeod. Interestingly, the MacLeod side of his mother's family all lived on that Island of Scotland within a few villages of each other for several generations further back.</p><p>President Trump is believed to be Donald named after a grandfather who was -- who was lost at sea not far from one of the pictures that he'll be shown there, the standing stone from Stornoway. So all of this supposed to have a relevance for President Trump.</p><p>GORANI: And we see Her Majesty, the Queen there leading the President. We remember in July during that working visit, there was a bit of controversy where he walked ahead of her during the Inspection of the Guards.</p><p>In this case, it seems as though at least so far, in the last few hours, this visit has gone off. There were a few tweets. But aren't there always with the President, but has gone off pretty well, as far as protocol is concerned?</p><p>ROBERTSON: I think everyone is going to be interested to see what he tweets after this experience today. He really has been assured who else gets to go in this room and be shown around here by the Queen. This is an absolute high honor.</p><p>So yes, those tweets at the beginning. But he does seem to have been on his best behavior, trying to observe protocols, trying to do what is expected of him rather than what he wants, which is often his own want.</p><p>The Queen there, a very diminutive figure next to him and the First Lady, but he is paying attention. I'm sure there are a lot of Heads of State who would wish President Trump paid as much attention to them and what they're saying as he is to the Queen right now.</p><p>But he does appear to be on his absolute best behavior. This is going to be a moment that he is going to be able to recall, that his family is going to be able to recall whatever one's views of President Trump are, this is a moment that he is not going to forget in his life. This will be a special moment for him.</p><p>GORANI: Yes, and neither will his children, because unusually the President brought with him four adult children and their spouses, which is not something that's normally done.</p><p>ROBERTSON: And they will be going to the State Banquet tonight and that's a very big representation from the family of the President of the United States at any gathering like this. It is unusual. This does seem to be in keeping as we understand, President Trump wants to expose his family to the pleasures of the high office that he now holds.</p><p>So what they will be able to take away from that State Dinner tonight will have been to rub shoulders with some of the leading most -- well, the leading figures of this nation.</p><p>GORANI: Now, interestingly, I am not seeing Prince Harry here, although we know he was part of the private lunch. We are seeing for instance there father though, Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla.</p><p>This evening, I understand is when Prince William and Kate, his wife will be taking part in the Banquet Dinner. And the Queen is the one who chooses which members of the Royal Family attend which events.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Absolutely. This is something that she choreographs. She knows how she wants it to go. It is very important I think that we saw Prince Charles earlier walking along the Honor Guard with President Trump and it really does sort of -- it's not only symbolic of the changing of the guard, as in the Royal Family that Prince Charles is being now bought into -- forced into more senior and significant role duties.</p><p>Of course, he has done this throughout his life. But with Prince Philip, taking somewhat of a retirement - semi-retirement back seat, Prince Charles is stepping up and this is the direction of the Queen.</p><p>GORANI: Will Prince Philip be at the Banquet tonight? Do we know?</p><p>ROBERTSON: I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>GORANI: And with the changing of the guard in the U.K., one has to wonder by bringing his children, if the President is hoping for at least some sort of passing on from generation to generation of status and power?</p><p>ROBERTSON: President Trump is all about his business. His family is part of that business. President Trump seems to live in the mode of wanting to create a dynasty whether it's a political one or a financial one. He certainly came from a financial dynasty in as much as he inherited the business from his father.</p><p>This does seem to be something that he wants to pass on and any high level connections that he can make, the people that he holds in high esteem is something that he is going to want to do for his family to pass the benefits, the business benefits that it's not forgotten on anyone that both the First Lady and President at times have expressed the interest that being President is also an opportunity to up the profile of the Trump brand.</p><p>GORANI: Just to remind our viewers or to bring our viewers up to date who may be joining us.</p><p>[09:40:06] GORANI: This is one of the many ceremonial events that are taking place on this day one of the Trump State Visit. This is Royal day.</p><p>This is a review of past gifts given to the Royal Family, which include, as you were saying, Nic Robertson, certain items that would have special significance to Donald Trump himself in his mother's side of the family that came from the Outer Hebrides in Scotland.</p><p>There are also American objects, \"Books of Birds\" and other interesting American objects, artifacts and historical pieces that were given to the Royal Family and that are now being presented.</p><p>And this is an extended group because it's not just the President and the First Lady. It's also the President's daughter, Ivanka Trump and her son- in-law, Jared Kushner. We're seeing Prince Charles there and his wife, Camilla.</p><p>I saw flashing past the camera, John Bolton, the National Security adviser, and I understand someone told me, Kellyanne Conway was there, though I have not laid eyes on her.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Kellyanne Conway has been part of this lunchtime delegation. We understand, along with Steve Mnuchin as well.</p><p>GORANI: I see, all right, well, there you have it. This is just a look at one of these events. Coming up next will be an exchange of gifts, I understand and we will bring that to you when it happens. And we will have a lot more analysis of also the relationship between the two countries and what this State Visit will mean to that.</p><p>The state of the special relationship will be key as the two countries discuss the opportunity for what Trump referred to ahead of his visit as quote, \"a very big trade deal.\"</p><p>The U.S. Ambassador angered some on Sunday by suggesting that everything including access to the National Health Service for U.S. pharma companies should be on the table in any such deal. And that is something that would be by any measure a very unusual thing for an American President to say.</p><p>Hadas Gold joins me now with more. Talk to us more about what the President said about any upcoming trade agreement between the U.K. and the U.S. after Brexit.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, Hala, you can't look at all this pomp and circumstance of this State Visit without understanding the importance of what the future relationship with the United States will be for the United Kingdom post Brexit.</p><p>Now, I want to lay out here the importance of the U.S. trade relationship with the U.K. First, I want to talk about the top investors in the United Kingdom for 2017. Number one was the United States with 26.3 percent, followed by the Netherlands at 17.1 percent; Luxembourg at 8.7 percent, and so on.</p><p>When you look at the top export markets, though, for the United Kingdom, the number one export market for the United Kingdom is the United States at 18.6 percent. However, if you think about the European Union, and all of the countries there, added them all together, that rip, the E.U. bloc represents a larger export market and trading partner for the U.K. than the United States.</p><p>But that just goes to show you this is going to be an interesting scenario that the U.K. will find itself in post Brexit in terms of trying to strike these trade deals.</p><p>In March, the Trump administration issued a few documents clarifying what they would be seeking in a trade deal with the United Kingdom and that includes changes to certain standards, things like agricultural products, that's the famous chlorinated chicken we've been hearing about for so long. They want to change those standards to make it easier for U.S. products to make it to the United Kingdom.</p><p>However, on the other side, the U.K. has to deal with the E.U. standards which are much higher on things like agricultural products. And so the U.K. will have to balance those two things together while trying to strike as beneficial of a trade deal, while they're at a much lesser power status than they have been before because you're dealing with much bigger blocs with the E.U. and a much bigger country with much more power in the United States.</p><p>Clearly, that is what the U.S. is trying to get in at a more favorable position. The U.S. Ambassador with his comments yesterday about how they'd want American companies to be able to bid on contracts on the National Healthcare System here in the United Kingdom was met with a lot of backlash already.</p><p>In fact, just a few minutes ago, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, specifically called out this NHS idea that Ambassador Woody Johnson threw out and said that it would cause the U.K. to have to agree to anything that President Trump wants. This will obviously be an issue as this visit goes forward tomorrow morning.</p><p>President Trump is expected to meet with business leaders from companies that represent big companies both in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. But all of this will also of course, be all determined on how Brexit actually turns out -- Hala.</p><p>GORANI: All right, Hadas Gold, thanks very much. And we'll catch up with Hadas a little bit later for more on another contentious issue and that is of course Huawei.</p><p>For now, Julia, back to you. We'll see you in a little bit.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, great point on Huawei as well. Front and center as far as these border trade battles are concerned.</p><p>Right now, let me give you a quick look at what we're seeing for U.S. stock markets this morning. Under a bit of pressure, I think as investors digest not only the bond market reaction to what we've seen over the last several sessions, but just how many fronts in this trade war exists right now. Let's get some context.</p><p>[09:25:11] CHATTERLEY: Mohamed El-Erian is Chief Economic Adviser at Allianz. He says the Feds must signal the start of a rate cutting cycle soon to avoid a costly policy mistake, and he joins us now. Mohamed, always a pleasure to have you on the show.</p><p>That's a bold call pushing the Federal Reserve here to signal that they're more concerned about the outlook than perhaps they have suggested. Talk me through why you think they need to do this and then we'll talk about the Catch 22 that presents.</p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ: It is very simple, Julia. The markets have already priced in three rate cuts this year. And they've done so on account of three things.</p><p>One, is concern that the trade tensions are becoming even less predictable. Because of what happened vis-a-vis Mexico last week. Two, the European elections mean a more fragmented regional and national political landscape, harder to implement pro-growth policies and three, the own dynamics of the bond market.</p><p>And the concern here is even if it's not justified by the U.S. economic conditions, if the markets don't get a rate hike, they'll have a huge tantrum that will then contaminate the economy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, that's a huge problem for the Federal Reserve to have to face down. They have to do what the market is telling them or risk the market having a tantrum because they don't get what they want. Is the bond market getting this right, whether it's the inversion of the yield curve, and the risk that that perhaps either does or doesn't suggest some kind of broader slow down and recession riskier? What is the market getting wrong? And what is it getting right here in your view?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: So I think the market has been conditioned for the last 10 years to expect the Fed to be their best friends forever, they are BFF. And when they don't see the Fed reacting quickly enough, they force the Feds hand, and that's been the story of the last few years.</p><p>It is not a good story. You want the Fed to lead the markets, not to follow the markets. But unfortunately, this codependence has gone too far. And now the market risks a self-fulfilling problem and that's one thing that I think that the Federal Reserve doesn't yet understand well enough. And it's like you say, it's a very uncomfortable position to be in.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do we need the Federal Reserve and Jay Powell to suggest that this week because Jay Powell does have an opportunity to perhaps indicate, \"Look, the trade risks here are perhaps greater than we initially thought.\"</p><p>EL-ERIAN: So this is a really hard question for me to answer. If you look short term in terms of market stability. Yes, we need Chairman Powell to indicate this this week.</p><p>If you look longer term, at some point, you've got to get out of this unhealthy codependence. So I think at the end of the day, the Fed will do it short term, and will do what previous Feds have done which is simply kick the can down the road.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Where does this unhealthy codependence between the markets and the Federal Reserve end? Because we could argue that compared to all the developed markets, central banks, at least the Fed has managed to hike nine times. It has some cushion for the next slow down. That's a very different story elsewhere in the world.</p><p>EL-ERIAN: It is and as much as we talk about the Fed, we should be spending a lot more time talking about the European Central Bank. They face an even tougher policy outlook.</p><p>First, the economy is much weaker. I worry about what economists call \"stall\" speed growth, which means it is not going fast enough to maintain enough momentum. Secondly, let's not forget that interest rate is already negative in Europe. Thirdly, the ECB is going through a major leadership transition.</p><p>So as much as we worry about the Fed, Julia, remember the ECB, their complexity is much higher than that of the Fed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and we're going to hear from them this week, too. Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz, I have to say goodbye to you. I apologize that we got trumped by President Trump and the Queen today, but we'll get you back soon. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>More to come on FIRST MOVE. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:52:01] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and I want to get straight back to London where President Trump is on his official visit to the U.K. Hala is there with all the details for us. Hala, it's a jam packed schedule. What can we expect in the coming hours?</p><p>GORANI: Well, he doesn't have a lot of downtime because after having been escorted by the Queen through the gift review at Buckingham Palace, he is on his way shortly to Westminster Abbey and that's where he will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior.</p><p>Leslie Vinjamuri, Associate Fellow at SOAS and head of the U.S. Programme at Chatham House joins me now. What jumps out at you? And just in the first few hours of this visit, of course controversy accompanying the President usually wherever he goes, but the U.K. is making a huge effort here.</p><p>LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD OF THE U.S. AND PROGRAMME AT CHATHAM HOUSE: It is and yet, to me it actually strikes me that the crowds aren't as big as I would have imagined. Of course, it's a deeply controversial visit. This is a President who as we know has only a 21 percent approval rating in the U.K., isn't popular, people have been very worried about security.</p><p>And the timing is not what was planned, but very difficult for the U.K.</p><p>GORANI: Well, the Prime Minister Theresa May is on our way out. She is a lame duck Prime Minister, we don't know who will lead the Conservative Party and thus, become the next Prime Minister. But the President has already weighed in in favor of Boris Johnson, a man who by the way, called them unfit to be President in 2016.</p><p>VINJAMURI: Yes, well, the President moves on very quickly, depending on where he sees a potential win. And I think with Boris Johnson, he sees somebody who very seems very independent, not constrained by any sort of deeper political expectation, somebody who he could do a deal with.</p><p>And I think somebody, you know, who has made it very clear that he wants a hard Brexit for Britain. This is what the President wants. He wants independent nations that he can deal with anything. He has made it very clear that for a U.S.-U.K. trade deal to go forward, Britain needs to get itself out of the customs arrangement and become completely independent.</p><p>GORANI: But the price of \"complete independence,\" quote, unquote, and might be some level of dependence on big trading partners like the United States and to hear Donald Trump describe a potential deal would have to include access to markets. That the U.K. as part of the E.U. doesn't open up to American say pharmaceutical products.</p><p>VINJAMURI: Yes, that's absolutely right. We saw in that interview with Ambassador Johnson yesterday or on Sunday, that yes, there will be an expectation that all sectors of the U.K. market will be open. It's a slightly odd decision to insert that into the debate right now because of course, it risks a backlash from the British public, when you start to talk about pressure on private investment, international investment in the NHS.</p><p>If you are trying to move the U.K. towards a harder Brexit, why make that intervention now? It's not a very strategic choice, actually.</p><p>GORANI: Oh, well, thank you very much, Leslie Vinjamuri and there will be many, by the way, business leaders, industry leaders taking part in this State Visit whether from the pharmaceutical industry and also the armaments industry as well. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>Julia, back to you. There's going to be a lot to talk about in the coming hours. The President on his way shortly to Westminster Abbey, back to you.</p><p>[09:55:08] CHATTERLEY: Absolutely, and we look forward to you bringing it to us. Thank you so much for that, and as you pointed out there, the timing could have perhaps, been better for this visit. But there it is anyway.</p><p>All right. Let me give you a look of what we're seeing in terms of the market action here today.</p><p>Obviously, lots concerned investors. Right now, it's the NASDAQ under pressure, some seven tenths of 1 percent as you can see there. Watching D.C. today, of course, too, for headlines on the U.S.-Mexico talks. The Mexicans trying to avert the threat of tariffs hitting imminently, of course, June the 10th, the date there.</p><p>And of course, I'll be back in a couple of hours' time with \"The Express\" to bring you all the latest not only on the market action and the stories that we're following, but of course, what's going on over in London and the Queen, visiting with President Trump and Melania, of course, too. So stay with CNN. We've got you covered.</p><p>For now though, that's it for the show. I'm Julia Chatterley, you've been watching FIRST MOVE, time to go make yours.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019060301cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-BC71-JB20-G2YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8267\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Credit: UN Women/Ryan Brown. </p><p>Earlier this year, when Facebook announced its plan to help launch a new digital currency called Libra[1] in 2020, many Western politicians reacted with scepticism and alarm. In the US, lawmakers in Congress twice summoned the head of the project to answer questions before inviting CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself. They asked whether the digital currency - which would exist only electronically and allow money to be transferred instantaneously across borders - could be used to launder money.They asked whether it would affect the US dollar's status as the global reserve currency.They even asked whether it could impact their government's ability to levy sanctions. Throughout the 12 hours of hearings, however, no member of Congress asked what is perhaps the most pressing question about libra: Could this corporate currency end up replacing a country's national currency? According to Facebook, libra cannot disrupt the financial systems of certain powerful nations because it will use their currencies in its reserve, alongside financial assets such as government-issued securities[2]. But these countries are not libra's main targets; instead, the project has taken aim at users in the Global South, including in Africa. The Libra Association has placed images of market women in Lagos and other scenes from the continent in its adverts, and Facebook emphasises that the digital currency will serve people who lack bank accounts, many of whom are in Africa. Libra could prove highly attractive on the continent. Facebook plans to integrate it into popular platforms such as WhatsApp and the currency would be free to use unlike existing mobile money services which charge small fees. This convenience and lack of cost could lead consumers to increasingly use libra for everything from transferring money to relatives to paying for everyday purchases such as food and transport. At the individual level, this could benefit users, but serious risks would emerge if the majority of a population were to adopt libra as the de facto national currency. This is not a far-fetched prospect in countries with small economies and little geopolitical power. If inflation were to reduce the national currency's value in such a country, people might swap it for libra in order to protect their savings. This would drive down the value of the national currency even further, contributing to a vicious feedback loop. Because dumping the national currency would be as easy as pushing a button on a phone, this process could start quite suddenly and be very difficult to stop. In the past, currency hops have typically been the result of sustained political and/or economic crises.The technological threat that libra poses to currencies is entirely new. Abandoning the national currency for libra could have several negative effects. First, it would constrict that government's ability to conduct monetary policy. Governments sometimes inject money into specific areas of the economy in order to boost the economy as a whole. If the national currency had little value, this strategy would be rendered ineffective. Particularly in times of economic distress, the inability to use this fiscal strategy could worsen the downturn. Second, as the Greek economist and politician Yanis Varoufakis has argued[3], 'a Libra token's purchasing power in any given country would fluctuate a great deal more than the domestic currency'. This is because when a financial asset is backed by several other assets that are denominated in multiple currencies, it tends to be more volatile in the near-term despite its long-term stability. In other words, if libra replaces the national currency, consumers would likely see the prices of goods and services change noticeably from month to month, making it more difficult to plan for future expenses. Varoufakis also points out that the libra network presents a major capital flight risk, as this borderless value transfer system could allow people to send large amounts of money abroad without securing the permission of relevant authorities. Another major problem is that the last people in the country to make the transition to libra would be buying these digital tokens with a national currency that is practically worthless. As a result, they'd have to accept miserably low exchange rates, which would largely wipe out their savings. Finally, there's the risk of the economy being 'switched off' when internet access is interrupted. It's concerning enough that authoritarian leaders today can block internet access for political purposes, but this power takes on a frightening new dimension when shutting down the internet means shutting down the monetary system as well. In light of all these dangers, it is alarming that the Libra Association has not shared its strategy for averting a mass currency dump. As Ramesh Srinivasan argues in Beyond the Valley[4], would-be users of new technologies must pay close attention to the effects of innovations. We must educate ourselves on how they might function (or malfunction) and reject the ones that appear to fall short of our minimum safety demands. In most countries, it is taken for granted that people should be able to choose their political leaders. But as governments appear less and less up to the task of regulating big tech, we should also demand a more meaningful role in choosing - or even designing - the technologies that increasingly impact our lives.

The gist is that their lofty share prices don't indicate a worrisome, late 1990s-like overvaluation, but largely reflect these companies' rapidly climbing earnings and cash flow.</p><p>But just because the big tech stocks collectively aren't in a \"B\" word, that doesn't mean there aren't weird things happening with individual company valuations. I want to point out two oddities, Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc.</p><p>The short version: Investors have always paid more to own a share of Facebook's future profits than they did for a slice of Google parent Alphabet Inc. Now they're not. As for Twitter, its stock price has tended to be discounted to its more successful rival, Facebook. And now it's not.</p><p>Until recently, stock buyers were willing to pay a lot more for each dollar of Facebook's earnings than they were for Google's. There were good reasons. Facebook is growing twice as fast as Alphabet, and its profit margins are bigger. People are willing to pay a premium figuring that Facebook has more opportunity to grow revenue and earnings.</p><p>This valuation gap started to shrink late last year, and briefly flipped during Facebook's Cambridge Analytica crisis in March \u2014 to the point where, for the first time, Alphabet's stock was consistently more expensive than Facebook's relative to the companies' profits. Different measures of earnings also show narrowing valuation gaps.</p><p>Facebook's ebbing valuation is due in part to concerns \u2014 encapsulated by the controversy over Facebook data harvested by Cambridge Analytica \u2014 that the company will have its wings clipped by regulators or that its profits will be crimped by the costs to clamp down on abuses of its social network.</p><p>Of course, one person's squeezed valuation is another person's buying opportunity, and the shrinking gap isn't a secret to savvy tech investors. Slightly more of the analysts who follow Facebook recommend buying those shares today, versus the beginning of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p><p>Facebook's valuation parity to Alphabet might in fact be a temporary blip. But if the company's earnings power or growth are diminished, its shrinking market appraisal might be proven correct in the future. This might be Facebook's new normal.</p><p>And that brings me to the other tech stock oddball. Twitter has always been pricey relative to its (until recently nonexistent) earnings, but the recent share recovery has made its valuation inexplicable.</p><p>Under generally accepted accounting principles, Twitter's enterprise value \u2014 or the market value of its stock minus cash plus debt \u2014 is 2,074 times its net income over the 12 months ended March 31, according to calculations derived from Bloomberg data. Allow me to provide a sophisticated analysis: That is bonkers.</p><p>On the same measure, perennial crazily valued Amazon is trading at 221 times its trailing net income.</p><p>Yes, Twitter doesn't tend to be valued on conventional metrics. Based on earnings excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation \u2014 but including the cost of stock compensation for employees \u2014 Twitter's enterprise value is 55 times this measure. That's still nuts.</p><p>Since Twitter went public nearly five years ago, its stock price relative to earnings generally has been lower than Facebook's. The discount was warranted. Twitter had far fewer users, advertisers didn't love it, there was no profit and revenue was significantly smaller.</p><p>Now the roles have reversed. While Twitter trades at 55 times its Ebitda for the past 12 months, Facebook investors are paying 21 times. (The picture is similar for forecasted Ebitda; I'm not using those figures because some analysts strip out Twitter stock compensation from estimates, and they don't for Facebook.</p><p>Twitter's outsize valuation gets lost sometimes in the narrative about the company's recovery. Twitter isn't an utter mess anymore. It is making genuinely smart changes to products for users and advertisers, and it slashed spending \u2014 including for its infamously high stock compensation.</p><p>But the rapidly climbing stock means Twitter's market value already reflects expectations of the company becoming both significantly more profitable, and rebounding from the days of shrinking revenue. Even if Twitter gets there, how much more can its valuation, and therefore its share price, keep rising?</p><p>Short-term stock market quirks have a way of sorting themselves out. For Facebook, a return to normal valuation might be welcome. For Twitter, not so much.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/4/153215285550.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/4/153215285550.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-121516891</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVG-0DK1-JDJN-64NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

The same rules of speed do not apply to government and policy. For years, innovation has outpaced the law and consumer protections, but now Big Tech and global governments have come to a head, and change is underway.The major tech firms that we rely on today have run user privacy flat. </p><p>Each day, it seems as if there is another data breach, or a report on how our data is re-packaged and sold. These abuses of trust have eroded public trust in the services and companies that we use. Now, legislators across the globe have started to take notice and begin what can only be described as a protective crackdown.Sentiments are changing and are creating a backlash against many firms. Equifax, Facebook, Twitter, even Uber have all suffered as a result of the backlash from leaked data. The demand for oversight boards[1] on AI and autonomous vehicles has increased as these technologies have advanced further. What business needs to realize is that regulation is here, and whether they like it or not. If they don't adapt, they face steep financial fines and lasting reputational damage.The main driver for this is, of course, the de facto user privacy and internet rights legislation: GDPR. Whilst this kind of regulation is typically restricted by geopolitical borders, GDPR is not, and has power beyond any one legislator's jurisdiction. The EU knows this and has willingly embraced its newfound position as the worldwide enforcer and protector[2] of internet rights.The right to privacy and data protection that the new regulation imposes is undoubtedly good for society, but will it also pose a new challenge to today's tech industry, where Silicon Valley remains the center of gravity. The challenge? Adjust to playing the game by someone else's rules or lose your leadership position in the technology food chain.The new frontier of data privacy At the dawn of the digital world as we know it today, the United States regulators passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act[3] of 2002 to increase data transparency, competition, but also crucially - accountability. The U.S. set the tone on a global scale - Sarbanes-Oxley was strict, backed up by hefty penalties for non-compliance, and companies across the globe adopted SOX as their own. Today, these same powers apply to GDPR, giving France and Germany -the leaders of a post-Brexit EU -regulatory authority that will span most of the western world.Given the EU's economic reach and influence, businesses will have a few options. The first will be to build alternative systems and processes for different legislatures - this will be expensive, time consuming, and complex. Or they can defer to someone else's rules - that of the EU. This is less difficult; as we've already seen, GDPR has quickly become the default for standards in privacy across the net from the U.S., to Germany, to everywhere in between.The ability to turn local laws into global de-facto standards requires legislative power and massive economic influence. Currently, only the United States, China, and European Union fit the bill. In the U.S., a deeply divided and gridlocked Congress has meant data and privacy legislation is being tackled at the state level. China is largely absent from this conversation as their internet and stance on privacy has diverged from the west. And if the U.K. does leave the EU, Its market will be too small and the government likely too fragmented to drive global policy without EU backing. An illustration picture taken through a magnifying glass shows the icon for the social networking app Facebook on a smartphone screen in Moscow, March 28, 2018. Photo: MLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/Getty Images A break from the EU would leave the U.K. in a similar position to Australia, where major tech companies threaten to cut jobs and products rather than bend to the will of legislators.The next holder of the digital map Despite the common rhetoric stating otherwise, policy and innovation do work together and are complementary. Throughout history, different approaches from governments have enabled innovation to thrive, whether through subsidies, tax breaks or exemptions.Though the era of an unchecked internet is coming to an end, innovation itself will continue to sail ahead. In fact, two new camps will emerge - new technology encompassing robotics and AI, and innovation rooted in compliance, encryption, and security, helping people gain sovereignty over how companies collect and retain their personal data.The governing body that leads the regulatory wave will heavily influence how businesses of the future operate and innovate. Due to its legislative gridlock, the U.S. is looking less able to define the next chapter, leaving Europe wide open to take the lead. That means tech companies must give up some of their Silicon Valley Frontierism for Emmanuel Macron's 'l'Europe qui protge,' or 'The Europe that protects[4].'While the details of policies and predictions of the outcome are worth debating, the clear worst-case scenario is taking no action. If the west cannot stand united, China will readily take advantage of the opportunity to widen its influence. This would be a devastating loss for democracy and privacy advocates around the world.Leadership over the next generation of the internet is up for grabs, but much more than that is at stake,who emerges from the power struggle will influence our views on innovation, privacy, and personal freedom for years to come? Let's hope they have our best interests at heart.(Emmanuel Schalit is theCEO ofDashlane) [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252436963/UK-demand-for-AI-professionals-has-almost-tripled-in-three-years\">https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252436963/UK-demand-for-AI-professionals-has-almost-tripled-in-three-years</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en-marche.fr/emmanuel-macron/le-programme/europe\">https://en-marche.fr/emmanuel-macron/le-programme/europe</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thebalance.com/sarbanes-oxley-act-of-2002-3306254\">https://www.thebalance.com/sarbanes-oxley-act-of-2002-3306254</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/03/26/the-eus-copyright-reform-is-an-example-of-a-europe-that-protects\">https://www.economist.com/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/03/26/the-eus-copyright-reform-is-an-example-of-a-europe-that-protects</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767156706474583825176900101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXM-MD51-JCMN-Y4DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><timeReceived>7:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 29, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS561450 CREDIT BUREAUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS561440 COLLECTION AGENCIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS541613 MARKETING CONSULTING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC8742 MANAGEMENT CONSULTING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7323 CREDIT REPORTING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7322 ADJUSTMENT &amp;

They stand at the heart of an internet economy that is growing at double-, if not triple-digit annual rates in the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now global tech companies are vying for supremacy across a geography whose long-known economic potential has been augmented by the pandemic, which has sparked a global digitisation drive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is an important growth story and [big tech companies] do not want to miss out on the opportunity,\" says Luc Grimond, partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group.</p><p>With research firm IDC expecting public spending on public cloud services in the Asia-Pacific region to triple through 2023, US and Asian cloud providers are squaring up. The likes of Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu are going head-to-head with Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services in the battle for market leadership in the world's fastest-growing cloud region.</p><p>Increasing demand With a highly connected and internet-enabled community, the Indo-Pacific region has digitally transformed over the last decade. The south-east Asian internet economy is growing particularly fast, having more than tripled since 2016 to reach $100bn for the first time in 2019, according to research from Google, Bain &amp; Company, and Temasek.</p><p>\"The two pacesetters in the region are Indonesia and Vietnam, which lead the pack with growth rates over 40% a year,\" says the report. It also highlights that the internet economy in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines is growing by between 20% and 30% annually.</p><p>With cloud computing infrastructure forming the backbone of today's internet economy, this increasing demand should translate into booming spending on cloud computing services, which are expected to increase almost three times to $76.1bn in 2023, from $26bn in 2019, IDC forecasts.</p><p>\"The public cloud is a launchpad for virtually all IT innovations in enterprises,\" says William Lee, research director for cloud services at global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC). \"If you look at the Covid-19 pandemic, cloud technology and services are at the centre of government and industry efforts to manage the crisis. We believe that the pandemic has further catalysed the cloud's position at the centre of enterprise and public sector digitisation.\"</p><p>Laying groundwork As soon as the Covid-19 emergency started regressing, big tech cloud providers rushed to announce multibillion-dollar investment campaigns in Asia to deepen the footprint of their cloud infrastructure in the region and maximise connectivity between themselves and their customers, enabling a stronger connection and improved latency.</p><p>Chinese company Alibaba announced a $28bn investment into its cloud division in April, which will be used mainly to expand its operating system and data centre servers. National peer Tencent raised the stakes further right after, announcing a major $70bn investment strategy to build hyperscale data centres, supercomputers and 5G networks, as part of plans to advance cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and quantum computing over the next five years.</p><p>Additionally, Baidu announced plans in June 2020 to deploy 5m AI cloud servers by 2030, the company told fDi.</p><p>US big tech companies have also been busy. In July 2020, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a $10bn investment in Indian businesses and infrastructure projects over the next five to seven years, enabling access to information in different languages and helping the digital transformation of businesses.</p><p>Google meanwhile launched its Jakarta Google Cloud Platform in June 2020 to provide a better connection for its Indonesia customers who were previously using services from neighbouring cloud regions such as Singapore and Sydney. Amazon Web services (AWS) - the global market leader in the cloud - will also build its first data centre in Indonesia by 2022. The AWS Jakarta region will enable technologies such as analytics, AI, IoT, machine learning and mobile services.</p><p>\"Information and communication technologies and cloud investments are pouring into Asia due to their young populations and continued growth. You have a tech-savvy consumer base that embraces innovation faster than the older populations of Europe and the US,\" says Mr Grimond of Boston Consulting Group. \"For the big cloud providers, it's a no-brainer.\"</p><p>Rise of the hyperscalers Amid rising concerns about data leakage or hacking, countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia have regulations that restrict access to data to local data centres. This means that cloud providers can only host data if they have a local presence. \"If you want to capture Indonesia, where the regulation is as strict as anywhere, there is no other way to do business but to build in Indonesia,\" says Boston Consulting Group's Mr Grimond.</p><p>Like the global market, south-east Asia's cloud industry is being driven by public cloud \"hyperscalers\".</p><p>\"The term 'hyperscale' is used to describe companies that have huge data centre networks that are used to support a multitude of external clients,\" says John Dinsdale, chief analyst and research director at Synergy Research Group.</p><p>\"The 20 companies that meet Synergy's criteria for a hyperscale operator include Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu.\"</p><p>Public demand It's not just the private sector driving demand for cloud services. Demand by public institutions is set to grow by an annual 37% in the next five years, IDC figures show, particularly as governments transition towards e-governance and smart city models.</p><p>For example, Vietnam is implementing a national digital transformation programme by 2025, including the upgrading of 4G to 5G network services, the acceleration of digital payments in the country, and the adoption of cloud services for all e-government services.</p><p>\"I expect the government to update its guidelines to increase usage of the public cloud to increase operational efficiency and agility as it moves along its digital transformation journey,\" says Siew Choon Liew, research manager at IDC Asia/Pacific.</p><p>Despite the booming demand, it will be hard for competing cloud infrastructure providers to enter new markets in the region where any of their competitors already has a dominant position, as confirmed by IDC's Mr Lee. \"If customers have already invested in people, skills, independent software vendors and partner relationships, it will take something special to convince them to add to the environment,\" he says. \"For example, Australia will not see much of the investment coming from the BAT (Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba) trio, even though it is the second-largest cloud market after China in the region.\"</p><p>When Alibaba laid out its first serious cloud-infrastructure investment campaigns in 2015, the then-president of its cloud division, Derek Wang, was very clear in his aims: \"Our goal is to overtake Amazon in four years, whether that's in customers, technology, or worldwide scale.\"</p><p>In 2020, the aim must be to keep a firm grip on the Indo-Pacific market as the chasing US pack snaps at its heels. \u00a6</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sunny forecast: IDC expects that spend on cloud computing will triple to $76.1bn in 2023, from $26bn in 2019</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORDIR-162595603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORDIR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NC-2801-JCBW-N1R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">336068</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Foreign Direct Investment (fDI)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59211\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

There`s no way to tell if this is going to hold but these are your current top ten Republican contenders according to the NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll that`s out today. We have here one surgeon, three first-term senators, we have one arguably failed and definitely fired executive of a really big tech company in California, and we also have five people who are current or former governors of U.S. states</p><p>So, if you`re looking for what type of candidate is really dominating the Republican race right now, it`s the governors. Former Florida<person><nameText>governor Jeb Bush </nameText></person>of Florida leading by five points in this new NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll. Current Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker comes in second.</p><p>Overall, five of the top ten Republicans in the current polling, five of the top ten are governors. They may not have been commander in chief of a nation, but they have been in charge of a state. The thinking goes that people will be able to extrapolate from that.</p><p>Former Texas Governor Rick Perry said just the other day, if you want to run for president, you should go home and try to run a state first. Take that, Ted Cruz.</p><p>Presidents, of course, come from all kinds of jobs. But the governors` mansions of our nation do seem to produce a lot of them. Governorships tend to be a fairly frequent incubator for presidents or at least for presidential ambitions. That seems to be true heading into this election as much or more so than it has been for any other recent elections.</p><p>It was also true heading into the last presidential election in 2012. Republicans, of course, ended up running the former governor of Massachusetts as their presidential nominee in 2012. But ahead of that election, at the time that everybody was starting to jump in to the Republican race, Republicans really did think very seriously about this guy instead, Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi. Long one of the great powers in the national Republican Party, governor of Mississippi, head of the Republican Governors Association, a legendary rain maker, just unparalleled Republican fund-raiser, unbelievably popular within the party among other high level Republicans, chairman, of course, of the Republican National Committee at one point.</p><p>But in the lead up to 2012, Haley Barbour seemed like for all the world he could be something really big, he could be something epic. President Barbour?</p><p>That was the question in the conservative \"Weekly Standard\" magazine in December 2010. Quote, \"All year, Haley Barbour has been deflecting questions about his presidential ambitions.\" President Barbour?</p><p>I mean, at the time it made sense. Haley Barbour had cultivated one of the great beltway power careers. He knew every Republican at every level in Republican politics. When he went home to Mississippi, he played on the national stage as the rebuilder of that hurricane-devastated Mississippi coast.</p><p>And with the Republicans looking for someone to challenge President Obama in 2012, President Barbour seemed as likely an idea as anyone. So, the \"Weekly Standard\" ran this more than glowing profile of Haley Barbour. Not just reveling in his high standing in the party and his power and his political experience, but in effect trying to reintroduce Haley Barbour to conservatives nationwide, basically giving the conservative fairytale of the Haley Barbour life story. They called it \"The Boy From Yazoo City.\"</p><p>In Haley Barbour`s hometown of Yazoo City, Mississippi, the schools there didn`t integrate until 1970. But when the schools did integrate in Yazoo City, they did so in relative peace, at least compared with the rest of Mississippi.</p><p>So, the magazine asked Haley Barbour in this profile, why that was. And this is what he said in response. He said, quote, \"Because the business community wouldn`t stand for it. You heard of the Citizens Councils? Up north, they think it was like the KKK. Where I come from it was an organization of town leaders. In Yazoo City, they passed a resolution that said anybody who started a chapter of the Klan would get their beep run out of town. If you had a job, you would lose it. If you had a store, they`d see nobody shopped there. We didn`t have a problem with the Klan in Yazoo City.\"</p><p>No problem where he came from, Haley Barbour said. The Citizens Councils took care of it. By Citizens Councils, what Haley Barbour meant were the groups that we also call the White Citizens Councils. The White Citizens Councils were founded after Brown v. Board, after the Supreme Court ordered the end of separate but equal in 1954, the end of segregation in this country in 1954. That`s why they were founded, in response to Brown v. Board.</p><p>The following year, right after that ruling, in 1955, the Citizens Council published the first ever issue of their newspaper. A clarion call for racial law in America. The Citizens Council`s aim, quote, \"is to preserve separation of the races against the assaults from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\".</p><p>Quote, \"There`s a rainbow of hope in the dark integration sky. Citizens Councils have sprung up to prevent this tragedy from being visited on the schools now and in the future. We will exhaust every legal resource available in resisting the attempt of a Marxist conscious Supreme Court to bring about mongrelization of the white race by judicial ruling.\"</p><p>Citizens Council also had this pamphlet summing up their reason for existence. Quote, \"The Citizens Council is the South`s answer to the mongrelizers. We will not be integrated. We are proud of our white blood and our white heritage.\"</p><p>Our white blood, our white heritage for a world of mongrelizers, a rainbow of segregated hope.</p><p>When Haley Barbour thinking about running for president in 2010, when in that context he praised the old Citizens Councils, that is what he was talking about.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>SAM ENGELHARDT, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY: I am Alabama`s Sam Engelhardt, also executive secretary of the Citizens Council of Alabama. We are dedicated to the preservation of segregation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will segregate the buses. And if necessary, I shall arrest every agent of the federal government who attempts to conspire to put across integration of the races.</p><p>W.J. SIMMONS, CITIZENS COUNCIL FORUM: The entire Negro movement in the United States was identified with the movement for Africa nationalism in Africa. This is a development of extreme significance, I think, because it opens up the possibility for non-white domination of the United States.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What direction is your movement going into, and what do you see in the future?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I see a political organization based on racial nationalism.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A third party?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A third party based on race.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you would lead it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The white race.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>MADDOW: Based on race, based on the white race, Citizens Councils.</p><p>There were white citizens councils across the old Confederacy -- many towns, many states. In Haley Barbour`s hometown of Yazoo City, Mississippi. The white council there ruled by fear. They left a vivid record of it.</p><p>In the 1950s when some local people petitioned for the schools around Yazoo City to be integrated, the white Citizens Council took out an ad, a full-page ad in the town`s newspaper listing the signers by name. The Citizens Council posted those names all over town, which manifestly terrified the people who dared to sign that petition as it was intended to do.</p><p>\"The Afro American\" newspaper reported this from the time, quote, \"Many signers have been penalized by loss of employment. Under this pressure, some have removed their names from the petition. J.H. Wright, a plumbing contractor listed above, lost two construction jobs, was refused plumbing supplies by a wholesale house and his grocer told him a loaf of bread would now cost him $1. He plans to move elsewhere.\"</p><p>People who were in favor of integrating the schools in Yazoo City had to flee from Yazoo City because of that nice Citizens Council which Haley Barbour praised for keeping the peace in his town in the civil rights era. They ran for their lives from the White Citizens Council.</p><p>So, when Haley Barbour described a peaceful past and historic record showed something far more horrifying, when he lionized the Citizens Councils and they turned out to be really easily shown as really vituperatively racist, Haley Barbour didn`t seem so presidential anymore. I mean, in the end, his full quote from that \"Weekly Standard\" glowing profile ended up being his overall summing up what it was like to grow up smack-dab in the middle of the civil rights revolution to desegregate his city and his state. He told the \"Weekly Standard\" when he thought back on that time, quote, \"I just don`t remember it being that bad.\"</p><p>And so, no, we never got a President Haley Barbour. We never got a Haley Barbour for president campaign. His 2012 campaign hopes did not survive must past his fond memories of the segregated South and his praise for the White Citizens Councils of the time.</p><p>But by the time that happened to Haley Barbour, the White Citizens Councils had gone through sort of a reincarnation. They became the Council of Conservative Citizens.</p><p>And despite their history, despite where they came from, despite who they still were in all but name, some politicians have just found over time that they couldn`t keep away from them. Yes, that`s because some politicians are just flat out obvious racists, right?</p><p>Former KKK grand wizard and Louisiana legislator David Duke, he spoke at a fund-raiser for the South Carolina Council for Conservative citizens in 1995, but, yes, he`s David Duke.</p><p>But then there`s Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia, he addressed the Citizens Council in 1998. After \"The Washington Post\" pointed out that Bob Barr has been hobnobbing with white supremacists, the congressman responded that he hadn`t actually known it was that kind of group.</p><p>In 1998, the Citizens Council finally got banned from CPAC, from the Conservative Political Action Conference on the blunt grounds that CPAC found that, quote, \"they are racists.\" And the White Citizens Council excuse me, the Conservatives Citizens Council got band from CPAC in 1998.</p><p>But Senator Trent Lott by that point, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi by then had been hanging out with Citizens Council for years. Senator Lott He got his picture taken with the Citizens Council guys in a private meeting in his office the year before they got banned by other conservatives from CPAC for being racist.</p><p>In 1999, Democrats in Congress tried to shame Republicans by forcing them to take a vote condemning the Council of Conservative Citizens. That vote failed but some of the work of trying to embarrass Republicans about supporting this group was done.</p><p>I mean, conservative politicians have managed to get themselves embarrassed over and over and over again by associating themselves with this barely reconstituted, segregationist, racist white supremacist group.</p><p>It`s not like this group is trying to hide anything, right? It`s not like they`re reconstructed and now they`re trying to make it look nice. I mean, this is from their statement of principles. Look. Look at this.</p><p>Quote, \"We believe the United States is a European country and that Americans are part of the European people. We oppose all efforts to mix the races of mankind to promote non-white races over the European-American people and to force the integration of the races.\"</p><p>I mean, that is what crawled out of the carcass of the group that Haley Barbour praised when he was going to run for president but then it didn`t work out. That`s the Council of Conservative Citizens.</p><p>Over this weekend, we learned that the shooter in Charleston, South Carolina, last week got his ideas from this Council of Conservative Citizens. He credited them directly with inspiring his attempts to start a race war with this mass murder in a Charleston church. This group that had always been racist, that had always been part of the worst, out of the stick, barbaric impulses in the modern history of our nation now in its new form has those same ideas all over the blood of nine African-Americans in a church in the city of Charleston.</p><p>And while the group insists today that they do not support violence, they have also since the shootings stood up for the ideas that the shooter says filled his head. They stood up for the content of his message. So, not for what he did but, yes, for why he says he did it.</p><p>So, that was one thing we learned this week. While the nation and the city of Charleston mourned those nine murder victims, we learned that the council of conservative citizens was part of this story.</p><p>Another thing we learned is that Republican politicians including some who are running for president now have been taking money, a lot of money, from that racist group.</p><p>Jon Swaine of \"The Guardian\" newspaper reporting this weekend that the group`s leader has given ten of thousands of dollars of campaign contributions in support of Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Rick Santorum and Scott Walker and Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton and on and on and on.</p><p>And most of them reacted to that news today, reacted to that reported link to the inspiration for the Charleston massacre, right? Most of these politicians reacted to that news today like they had just been handed a live cottonmouth snake. One by one, they have started giving the money back or giving the money to charity in many cases giving the money to a charity benefiting the families of the victims in Charleston.</p><p>In addition to what you see here, we can also tell you tonight that Steve King, Iowa Congressman Steve King, tells us he`s sending back what he got to Charleston and so is Louie Gohmert. And according to \"The Washington Post,\" so are Jeff Flake and Tom Cotton.</p><p>As we hear back from more people who have taken donations from the Council of Conservative Citizens, we`ll let you know. But we can tell you clearly that where Republicans have stood by and for and in some cases with this racist group in the very recent past, after those murders in that Charleston church, now as of today, they`re not standing by that group anymore, after decades, right?</p><p>I mean that group was founded right after Brown v. Board. Everybody knew who they were. And over and over and over again, for decades, conservative politicians still allied themselves with that group. Even though everybody knew who they were, they had never hidden their light under a bushel. They`ve been an overtly racist group with ties to the terror that was the backlash against the civil rights movement in this country.</p><p>They were the vanguard of the defense of segregation in this country. And for decades conservative politicians have still associated themselves with this group. Sometimes, they get a little icky about it but it persists.</p><p>Today, it seems to have stopped. Sometimes, it takes a lot of time to get these things right, right? Sometimes you grab the hot handle with your bare hand more than once. But when you finally drop that thing, turns out it lands with a tremendous clatter and we are at that profound place right now, tonight in our country on the Conservative Citizens Council, nay the White Citizens Council on the Confederate flag, and a lot of other things that felt like they would never ever be gone from even our modern politics, right now our politics are making a fascinating and a very hard turn.</p><p>And the rest of that story is when we come back.</p><p>MADDOW: So, as I mentioned with Chris at the top of the show there has been a bunch of breaking news tonight. There is some new breaking news tonight on the issue of the Confederate flag flying in the American South. But this new breaking news actually does not involve the state of South Carolina, it involves another southern state and a surprise coming out of that state tonight. That story is coming up. Please stay with us.</p><p>MADDOW: So, it`s not like it has been there forever. It`s been there since 1962. I mean, not 1862 when the Confederacy existed, right, and was raging war on the United States. It has not been there since 1862. They put it up in 1962. In the early 1960s, they put up the Confederate flag in South Carolina flying over the capitol dome during the civil rights movement of the 1960s.</p><p>And because of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, it was put up and basically -- politically it is clear from the context of the time, it was put up as a symbol of resistance to desegregation in the early 1960s as South Carolina and the rest of the Deep South burned and marched and lit up with gunfire and bombings and beatings and intimidation and rage in that catalyzing and epic fight that we had as country to try to desegregate the South.</p><p>South Carolina state government made a decision to put up the Confederate flag over its state capitol in 1962 basically as a way of saying that their state would not desegregate.</p><p>But then after the civil rights era, after the segregation issue was settled, at least in polite company and the civil rights side supposedly won, South Carolina didn`t take down the flag, they left it up over the capitol dome. For a very long time that was awkward and difficult for all the obvious reasons.</p><p>And South Carolina was not alone in the South in flying that flag, but the fight there has been particularly loud and hard fought and particularly tenacious in large part because the Confederate flag has been great politics for conservative politicians who have used that issue and that symbol to court white voters in South Carolina by supporting the Confederate flag, by supporting symbols of the old Confederacy.</p><p>This weekend, part of the outpouring of grief over the massacre of African-American churchgoers in Charleston last week, part of the effort to grieve those victims and express a collective anguish about that crime, a collective revulsion for what happened at the Mother Emanuel church, part of that this weekend in a fairly impromptu way spilled over out of the formal vigils and church services into this gathering on a bridge in downtown Charleston, this big beautiful modern bridge which is called the Arthur Ravenel Bridge.</p><p>This is Arthur Ravenel. He was a Republican Senate senator from South Carolina. His name is on that bridge. He is celebrated in South Carolina for his political career.</p><p>And Arthur Ravenel`s political career is best remembered for his impassioned defense of the Confederate flag continuing to fly at the state capitol in South Carolina.</p><p>See this picture there? See in the background, see a strange looking background for him at this rally? What that is actually a massive Confederate flag several stories tall that has been laid out on the steps of the statehouse, to serve as a backdrop for him leading this rally in favor of the Confederate flag in January of 2007.</p><p>It`s easier to see in color. Look. Oh, right, that`s the guy who the bridge is named after.</p><p>And at the time this picture was taken, at the time the Senator Ravenel was leading this pro-Confederate rally in South Carolina, he was not just ginning up support for the flag and symbols of the Confederacy, he was reaping the political rewards for doing so. I mean, if you`re a conservative politician in South Carolina all of these years, it has really helped to be a staunch defender of the Confederate flag and it flying at the state capitol.</p><p>Two years before this rally in 1998, South Carolina voted out an incumbent Republican governor named David Beasley after Governor Beasley said that he wanted to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol grounds. After he said that, he lost his seat. They threw him out of office over that.</p><p>In 1994, the state legislature tried to get rid of the Confederate flag over the capitol. It failed. In 1995 they tried again, it failed. In 1998, they tried again, it failed. The following year, in 1998, that effort to get rid of that flag claimed the incumbent Republican governor.</p><p>I mean, it had been bad politics. It has been bad politics for white conservative politicians to be against the Confederate flag in that state. It has been good politics for conservative politicians to be for the Confederate flag. And that dynamic has been bolstered by the fact that South Carolina has this peculiar national political position as one of the early voting presidential states.</p><p>South Carolina first in the South, right? It`s Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina.</p><p>So, after that Republican governor got turfed out in South Carolina in 1998, as the NAACP was coordinating a big economic boycott of South Carolina over them flying that Confederate flag, as State Senator Arthur Ravenel was holding his rally in front of the 100-foot tall Confederate flag on the steps of the state capitol, in the year 2000, George W. Bush and John McCain were battling it out in South Carolina to try to win the Republican nomination for president. And so, they very knowingly strolled right up to this Rubicon, right?</p><p>Would supporting the Confederate flag remain just a political asset for South Carolina conservatives or would it become a national conservative cause, too?</p><p>John McCain in a lemming and hawing way sort of tried to refuse to say what he thought on the issue but at the same time, he played to the issues politics when he was asked about South Carolina`s Confederate flag, he made sure to reference his own role in opposing the Martin Luther King holiday being recognized in Arizona. He then went on to say the issue of the Confederate flag was a state`s right issue for South Carolina. Who is he to tell South Carolina they ought to take that Confederate flag down?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: If I were a south Carolinian I would make a choice. In Arizona, we had a big fight over the Martin Luther King holiday. I didn`t like it when people came in and told us what to do in Arizona when -- about the Martin Luther King holiday.</p><p>KATIE COURIC, NBC TODAY You`ve weighed in on other state issues in the past.</p><p>MCCAIN: On this issue I have not weighed in. This issue is not going to be helped by me weighing in on it.</p><p>COURIC: You said in the past when you were asked about it on \"Nightline\", if you were president what would you say, and you claimed that Bill Clinton had not told the people of South Carolina what to do. But yesterday in Boston, President Clinton said he thought the flag should be taken down. Given that --</p><p>MCCAIN: I understand that he would say that and I appreciate that. My view is that I think that the people of South Carolina are best qualified to make the decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MADDOW: John McCain speaking in January 2000 in the midst of that mighty battle for the presidential nomination, particularly the South Carolina primary coming up in the Republican presidential nominating race. He was fighting it out with George W. Bush for that nomination, particularly to try to win that primary.</p><p>George W. Bush took basically the same line as John McCain on the issue. Who am I to tell South Carolina they ought to take that Confederate flag down?</p><p>But because George W. Bush, we forget now, was a very, very good politician, although he took the same line as John McCain did, he sounded way better when he did it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAMS, MODERATOR: As an American citizen, do you have a visceral reaction to seeing the Confederate flag?</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, THEN-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As an American citizen, I trust the people of South Carolina to make the decision for South Carolina.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MADDOW: Cheers, cheers. For no one telling South Carolina to take down that Confederate flag.</p><p>Not long after he lost the South Carolina primary to George W. Bush, then he dropped out of the race, and South Carolina ultimately decided to take the Confederate flag off the state capitol dome and move it instead to what is frankly a more prominent place at a Confederate memorial, right on the state capitol grounds in front of the state house, right on a main drag that you drive through in downtown Columbia. Right after all that, John McCain, after he lost -- after South Carolina moved the flag to a different part of the state capitol grounds, John McCain said he shouldn`t have did what he did there. He said he was ashamed of himself for how he tried to play that issue in South Carolina. He basically said he was pandering for votes and he didn`t really believe that South Carolina should keep flying that flag but he didn`t feel comfortable saying so during the campaign.</p><p>Once George W. Bush had served his two terms as president and John McCain was once again running to try to win the Republican Party`s presidential nomination, his rivals in 2008 primaries used John McCain`s contrition on the Confederate flag, him going soft on the Confederate flag, they used it against him in the 2008 presidential race.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You don`t like people from outside the state coming and telling you how you ought to raise your kids. You don`t like people from outside the state coming down and telling you what to do with your flag. In fact, if somebody came to Arkansas and told us what to do with our flag, we would tell them where to put the pole. That`s what we`d do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MADDOW: Mike Huckabee running for president in 2008 saying South Carolina should vote for him and not John McCain because he would never criticize the Confederate flag flying at that state capitol. Not like some. That was 2008.</p><p>Now, after the Charleston massacre, after the confessed shooter posted his start a race war screed online and posted all those myriad photos of himself with the Confederate flag, after all those years in South Carolina fighting about the Confederate flag being flown at the state house, all those years of conservative politicians in the state and politicians from around the country supporting the Confederate flag in order to get white people in South Carolina to vote for them, after all of these years, this massacre finally started to crack the dam. And you could see it start to break with old Mike Huckabee himself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUCKABEE: For those of us running for president, everyone is being baited with this question as if somehow that has anything to do whatsoever with running for president. And my position is, it most certainly does not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MADDOW: Says the man who last time he ran for president ran in South Carolina on not just supporting the Confederate flag flying at the capitol but also suggesting what people could do with the flagpole if they disagreed. Now, he finds the subject inappropriate for comment by a presidential candidate.</p><p>See, you can see the dam breaking on this issue, in the person of old Mike Huckabee trying once again to find political advantage on this issue but now he doesn`t know where to find it.</p><p>You can see the dam breaking when other flags -- the other flags on the state capitol grounds in South Carolina, the American flag, the South Carolina flag, they were lowered to half staff in the wake of the Charleston massacre last week while that Confederate battle flag stayed at full staff on the capitol grounds. Maybe that`s when the dam actually started to break.</p><p>But after 50 years of not just fighting about that flag but conservative politicians statewide and nationwide banking on the conservative flag in order to -- on the Confederate flag in order to get votes from white people who like it in South Carolina, after decades of that finally today, the dam broke.</p><p>One of the politicians who was there when that happened joins us next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Fifteen years ago, after much contentious debate, South Carolina came together in a bipartisan way to move the flag from atop the capitol dome. Today, we are here in a moment of unity in our state, without ill will, to say, it`s time to move the flag from the capitol grounds.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We are not going to allow this symbol to divide us any longer. The fact that people are choosing to use it as a sign of hate is something that we cannot stand. The fact that it causes pain to so many is enough to move it from the capitol grounds. It is, after all, a capitol that belongs to all of us.</p><p>July 4th is just around the corner. Soon, we will once again celebrate birth of our nation and of our freedoms. It will be fitting that our state capitol will soon fly the flags of our country and of our state and no others.</p><p>God bless, God bless the people of the great state of South Carolina. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MADDOW: South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley coming out today for the first time in her career, first time in her life, in saying that the Confederate battle flag has to come down from the grounds of the state capitol in South Carolina.</p><p>Excuse me. This is the first -- this is second time I`ve ever sneezed live on television. Pardon me.</p><p>Look at who else was there with Nikki Haley, though, when she made the announcement. On the right side of your screen there, you can see that she`s got both of the state`s U.S. senators. Immediately to her left, so just to the right of her on the screen, you see U.S. Senator Tim Scott and then to his left, further to the right of your screen, you see Lindsey Graham, U.S. senator, candidate for president this year. Neither of them have ever previously criticized the Confederate flag but today both of them came out and said it should come down at the state capitol in South Carolina.</p><p>Behind them, you can also see former governor of South Carolina, Mark Sanford, who is now a congressman from the state. Next to him is the mayor of Charleston, Joseph Riley. The chairman of the National Republican Party, Reince Priebus, was also there at the announcement, he`s a little hard to see. But he`s about two rows behind the governor.</p><p>On the left side of your screen, you see Congressman Jim Clyburn. And next to him is the top Democrat in the South Carolina state legislature, Representative Todd Rutherford, who joins us now.</p><p>Representative Rutherford, thank you so much for your time tonight, sir. It`s really good to have you here.</p><p>STATE REP. TODD RUTHERFORD (D), SOUTH CAROLINA: Thanks for having me, Rachel.</p><p>MADDOW: Let me ask you about your feelings about what happened today in your state. Did you ever think this would happen and how do you feel about having been part of this today?</p><p>RUTHERFORD: No, I don`t think anybody ever saw this coming, at least not now, at least not this soon. But I hate that it happened on the eve of this tragedy and I hate the tragedy is what made this happen.</p><p>You know, the governor, we applaud her efforts. We know that it wouldn`t happen without her. We applaud all these conservatives and their sea change in deciding something that has been hateful for years now, all of a sudden, they see it as hateful and want to take it down.</p><p>MADDOW: You know, one of the things that I wondered today is if there have been conservatives, if there have been Republicans sort of operating behind the scenes who have been maybe pushing for this to happen in a long way and if this is an opportunity, or if you really feel like this was spontaneous, that this was just something that was going to be inevitable simply because of the shock to the state for what happened last week.</p><p>RUTHERFORD: You know, we will certainly take it however we can get it. However, when you see Reince Priebus there, it certainly gives you the indication that maybe this was -- they were tired of the Republican presidential candidates dancing around nine people getting killed over this hateful symbol and whether it ought to come down. Every single time they had to answer a question, every single candidate that answered it stumbled over it and simply looked silly on a national stage, rather than saying the flag is a hateful symbol and should have come down a long time ago.</p><p>MADDOW: In the past in South Carolina, there have been obviously big fights about this issue. There have previously been very high level efforts to try to get the flag down at the state capitol. Do -- is it clear to you that it will work this time? What actually has to happen in order for this to really come down?</p><p>RUTHERFORD: You know, it is clear to me that this time it is going to work. I met with House leaders over the past several days and it`s clear that in the House at least, we`re going to have the votes to change the agreement, which is the agreement that we`re operating under right now and bring a bill to the forefront that will take the flag down.</p><p>Once that bill gets to the Senate, there are one or two people that could hold it up, but I don`t know that they will have enough votes to stop it all together. So, for the first time literally, in my 44 years, it`s clear that this flag is going to come down.</p><p>MADDOW: Do you think that there will be not so much a backlash but do you think there will be a dug-in effort to defend it? Obviously, this seems like more of a consensus issue that`s it ever been, but presumably, there will be forces in South Carolina that fight to keep it up there.</p><p>RUTHERFORD: There absolutely will be forces that fight to keep it up there. This has been used as a symbol to divide South Carolina for, again, since 1962, as you stated earlier.</p><p>In 2007, I put in a bill to take the flag down. It didn`t even get a hearing. But I think right now, a lot of those power brokers, a lot of people in that state house that`s behind me have decided that Senator Pinckney who is our colleague, has been our colleague for over 20 years and most peaceful man in that whole body, he was killed for simply being black and that enough is enough. And that flag needs to go.</p><p>MADDOW: South Carolina State Representative Todd Rutherford, the top Democrat in the South Carolina legislature -- sir, thanks for your time tonight. I know this has been a heck of a day. Thank you for being here.</p><p>RUTHERFORD: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>MADDOW: Thank you. And we do actually still have some new news tonight on the status the of the Confederate flag in another southern state. We have that along with a lot of other news.</p><p>Please stay with us.</p><p>MADDOW: So, this is what the great state as Mississippi has flown as its state flag since 1894, more than a century. Mississippi doesn`t have a separate stand alone Confederate flag flying at its state capitol. Mississippi just put the Confederate flag inside the other one. It`s part of their official state flag.</p><p>In 2001, Mississippi voters were asked if they wanted to replace that Confederate symbol with something less controversial. Mississippi voters decided overwhelmingly that, no, they would rather keep their flag as is. Look at that margin.</p><p>Tonight, however, it seems that the tide might be changing in Mississippi because tonight, Mississippi`s House speaker who is a Republican says this, quote, \"As a Christian, as a Christian, I believe our state`s flag has become a point of offense that needs to be removed. We need to begin having conversations about changing Mississippi`s flag.\"</p><p>\"The Jackson Clarion Ledger\" says this is the first time in Mississippi Republican has called forgetting the rebel flag out of the state flag.</p><p>Also tonight, Walmart has announced that it stores will no longer carry merchandise that includes the Confederate symbol. Quote, \"We never want to offend anyone with the products that we offer. We`ve taken steps to remove all items promoting the Confederate flag from our assortment, whether in our store or on our Web site. We have a process in place to lead us to the right decisions. Still at times, items make their way into our assortment improperly. This is one of those instances.\"</p><p>So, groundbreaking news tonight from Mississippi and from Walmart of all places.</p><p>More to come, for sure. Stay with us.</p><p>MADDOW: Our long national nightmare of raisin tyranny is over. It`s true. This morning, the Supreme Court struck down federal raisin regulations that had been in place since the New Deal.</p><p>Also, there was a patent case involving this Spider-Man web blaster toy where you shoot webs out of your wrists like Spidy does. The patent holder lost in this case, but Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, who is a comics fan, made not one, not two, not three, but I think four different Spider-Man jokes in her ruling today. She`s previously referenced Dr. Seuss and also the Tommy Tutone song \"867-5309\" in Supreme Court rulings.</p><p>So, the Spider-Man thing should not have been a surprise but still awesome to see things like this, patents endow their holders with certain super powers but only for a limited time. So, yay for Spider-Man. Yay for having an awesome comics nerd Supreme Court justice.</p><p>Here`s the thing I want to know though -- the court usually issues its rulings in June. This is June. Usually, they issue their rulings on Mondays.</p><p>OK. It`s Monday today. It`s already June 20-something, 22nd, right? They`ve got seven more rulings to hand down. They already expanded their ruling days to not just Mondays but also Thursdays. And then today, they said they`re also going to issue rulings this week on Friday.</p><p>Why are they doing that? Does that mean anything? What does it mean, if anything, particularly about the giant cases their about to rule on, on Obamacare and lethal injection, and same-sex marriage.</p><p>The other thing I want to know about is this -- is it not spooky that so much of the country is basically already assuming how the same-sex marriage case in particular is going to go? \"The New York Times\" just ran this glowing profile, Justice Anthony Kennedy today, tracing the origins of his support for gay rights to previous times in his life. Nice piece. This is the kind of thing you might expect to run though after Justice Kennedy had cast the deciding swing vote to legalize same-sex marriage.</p><p>I mean, this is from the piece today: If as many analysts expect, the court does extend same-sex marriage rights nationwide, Justice Kennedy will get much of the credit.</p><p>It`s like \"The Times\" thought, we know they`re going to legalize it. Let`s just run this piece about how it happened now before it actually happens.</p><p>You know, they might not rule that way. And a sense of inevitability can be a powerful thing and can also be a dangerous thing. The reason this case is being decided by the Supreme Court in the first place is that the seemingly inevitable, unstoppable march toward nationwide legal gay marriage was, in fact, stopped when an appeals court ruled last fall that some state marriage bans were legal.</p><p>I mean, it was all inevitable until one day it was not. The Supreme Court really could rule against gay marriage or the justices could split the difference somehow, or the court could, yes, legalize gay marriage nationwide. We should know Thursday or Friday or maybe Monday?</p><p>But we really do not know right now. Are the expectations here getting way out ahead of the actual case? And how are they going to get all of these rulings out before the end of the month?</p><p>Let`s ask someone who knows these things. Dahlia Lithwick is senior editor and legal correspondent at \"Slate\".</p><p>Dahlia, it`s great to see you. Thank you for being here.</p><p>DAHLIA LITHWICK, SLATE: I don`t know these things.</p><p>MADDOW: No, come on. You know -- but at least you know what we don`t know.</p><p>LITHWICK: OK.</p><p>MADDOW: Is it weird that they`ve got this many left with this sort of time that they`re doing rulings Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays? This does always happen, or just feels like a surprise?</p><p>LITHWICK: Yes, it always happens and they start the week, you think it`s going to be Monday, then it`s Monday and Thursday, then it`s Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.</p><p>This is what`s done. We`re thinking they`re going to be done by Tuesday, a week from tomorrow, but they`ve gone into July before.</p><p>MADDOW: There`s no hard and fast rule about what they do, and it doesn`t say anything about what`s happening now in terms of the judges finishing up their rulings, in terms of how they`re negotiating, in terms of how they`re going to go. No inclination?</p><p>LITHWICK: I think the inclination is that they`re writing a lot of opinions and concurrence and dissents and there`s just a lot of writing and rewriting and drafting going on. That`s what happens. That`s why the big, big case -- I used to think they just did it for drama, they just held the biggies until the end. But it`s just because there`s an enormous amount of writing to be done.</p><p>MADDOW: In terms of the expectations around the same sex marriage case, I feel like -- the reason I use that word \"dangerous\" is because I feel like there`s an expectation particularly among people particularly who passionately support gay rights, who passionately support marriage equality, there has become a de facto expectation that the ruling is going to be a great day. I say that`s dangerous because I feel like people are in for a real fall if that turns out to be either a mixed decision or negative decision.</p><p>Do you feel the expectations are warranted based on the case?</p><p>LITHWICK: I do. I think that it`s already hard to get past the fact that Anthony Kennedy who you just kind of observed is the guy. He`s written the three landmark gay rights decisions. These are the cornerstones of our current legal regime when we look at gay rights. It`s hard to imagine that a guy who writes so poignantly about dignity and families` expectations of dignity in marriage who asked about dignity in oral argument a lot --</p><p>MADDOW: Right.</p><p>LITHWICK: -- that he`s going to turn his back on this. It`s just hard to see it.</p><p>And so, I think there is some basis for thinking that this is going to go the way people want it to go on the left side of the aisle.</p><p>The other thing, Rachel, and this is important, people are lobbying the court. There`s a little bit of, you know, well-placed op-eds in \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The New York Times\" that are attempting to say history, history, history. This really matters.</p><p>MADDOW: Right. Especially if you guys are pushing it right to the last minute -- it`s a last-minute opportunity to influence you. Will you come back and explain when it happens?</p><p>LITHWICK: I will.</p><p>MADDOW: Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor and legal correspondent at \"Slate\" magazine -- thank you so much.</p><p>LITHWICK: Thank you.</p><p>MADDOW: All right. Much more ahead, please do stay with us.</p><p>MADDOW: So, there is some more news to report out of South Carolina. It actually involves the funeral that`s going to be held later this week for the pastor of the Mother Emanuel AME Church, and frankly, the almost unbelievable circumstances that will lead up to that funeral that sort of take place on Friday. It`s kind of hard to believe after what we`ve discussed in this hour and what has happened in today`s news, but we`ve got that update on the funeral in just a moment. Stay with us.</p><p>MADDOW: One last thing to note tonight. This is something that is mind-bending to me.</p><p>You know that the pastor of the church who was killed in the Charleston massacre at Mother Emanuel Church last week, you know that in addition to being the pastor of that historic church, Clementa Pinckney was also a well-respected South Carolina state senator.</p><p>He was first elected to the statehouse when he was only 23 years old, making him the youngest person ever elected to the state legislature in South Carolina. He was then elected to the state Senate four years later, and he has served there in the state Senate for the past 15 years.</p><p>Last week when Clementa Pinckney was killed in his church, his fellow state senators draped his desk in black and wept over him at the state Senate.</p><p>Well, now, today, they have announced that there will be public viewings of his body before he is buried on Friday. There`s going to be a viewing at his own church, at the Mother Emanuel Church. There`ll be a viewing of a second AME church in Charleston as well, and then there will be a viewing at the state house. He will lie in state at the rotunda of the state houses in Columbia.</p><p>And that is an honor and a beautiful thing for a long-time and beloved state legislator. But in South Carolina that means people coming to see his body and mourn him and pay their respects will have to walk past the Confederate flag on the state capitol grounds in order to do so. And that is amazing in any circumstance. But given the circumstances of his murder and the murder of his parishioners, it is almost impossible to imagine those two things happening at the same time, him lying in the rotunda and the freaking Confederate flag flying outside.</p><p>But that is what made happened in South Carolina this afternoon all the more stunning. South Carolina led by its Republican governor now moving to take that Confederate flag down at state capitol grounds. Now, there is this suddenly important logistical question about when they will do did and whether that Confederate flag will be down in time for Senator Pinckney to lie there in state on Thursday.</p><p>You should also know that when the actual funeral is held for the senator on Friday, Vice President Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama and President Obama will all be there in the funeral in person. And now we know that the eulogy for Senator Pinckney will be given by President Obama himself.</p><p>That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again tomorrow.</p><p>Now, it`s time for \"THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL\".</p><p>Good evening, Lawrence.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

As America's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by a record 33 per cent in the quarter, bumper earnings reported by the largest digital trailblazers emphasise the corporate inequality bothering antitrust legislators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Countless articles have opined on the sustainability of tech's profit boom and whether market valuations can be justified. But the question that shouldn't be forgotten is: with such a concentration of earnings in a few huge companies (in aggregate the six most celebrated names grew EPS quarter on quarter by almost as much as US GDP fell), what does this say about the expensiveness of other US stocks?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Research conducted by Verdad, a global asset management company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, flags the worrying proportion of stocks that are priced on longer multiples of sales and earnings than tech's leading companies.</p><p>Out of 3,000 US stocks with a market capitalisation above $100m, Verdad identified a \"Bubble 500\" group of companies, which transverses 7 per cent of the S&amp;P 500 and a quarter of the Russell 2000 index of mid to small-cap companies.</p><p>Verdad's analysis was prior to second quarter updates being published by many companies and despite GDP contracting, US corporate earnings have on the whole surprised to the upside. Investment bank UBS notes that earnings are only down by around 35 per cent compared with the 40 per cent quarter-on-quarter fall they had predicted, with four-fifths of companies surpassing expectations and a median earnings beat of 16 per cent.</p><p>That's good news for the economy going forward, but although 70 per cent of companies have beaten sales estimates, the median positive surprise of 2.8 per cent was against the dampest of forecasts. Investors should be cheered by improved trends, but some of Verdad's findings based on first-quarter numbers were startling and questions about the stretched valuations of growth stocks have still to be answered.</p><p>Collectively, at the time of Verdad's report, shares in the Bubble 500 were trading at 13-14 times sales and in aggregate they were making zero profit, zero margins and zero return on assets.</p><p>Verdad's Bubble 500: is growth risk being mis-priced?                   </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"7\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">Valuation</entry><entry colname=\"col4\" nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col4\">Growth</entry><entry colname=\"col6\" nameend=\"col7\" namest=\"col6\">Profitability</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">EV/Sales</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Earnings Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3 yr sales CAGR (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">2 yr fwd sales CAGR est (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Net Income margin (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Return on assets (%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weighted Average</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">14x</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">19</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">20</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.5</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Median</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">13x</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-2.1</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">10</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">13</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">-0.6</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">-9</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>                     Source: VerdadValuations for Bubble 500 companies are, observes Verdad, seemingly justified by the difference in their forward growth expectations versus the big tech stocks. Yet, with the likes of Amazon (US:AMZN) and Google's parent Alphabet (US:GOOGL) becoming players in so many industries, the largest companies present a significant competitive challenge to smaller companies the market is implying should grow fastest.Software giant Microsoft (US:MSFT) is now being grouped with Facebook (US:FB), Amazon, Apple (US:AAPL), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Alphabet; so FANMAG is the new acronym. While the Verdad team acknowledges it is typical for smaller and younger businesses to be valued on a longer multiple of enterprise value to sales, the market is asking a lot of such companies.Verdad writes that \"we feel it's shocking to consider that only very rarely have any of the surviving sample of today's FANMAG winners traded above 10 times revenue\". Expanding on a salient point, it continues: \"We seem to be paying even more today for a broad bucket of unprofitable hopefuls than we were willing to pay for the FANMAG archetypes before they survived and won their near-monopoly status.\" That status was subject to scrutiny by a US congressional hearing last week, with four of the chief executives - Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook of Apple and Amazon's Jeff Bezos - taking turns to be questioned by remote conference.Perhaps the committee appreciates the irony; technology pioneered by these companies enables the grilling of their chief executives, mid-pandemic. The sight of Mr Zuckerberg in a suit is a reminder they are dealing with former upstarts that have matured into the main breadwinners of the Nasdaq exchange. These days Facebook's head honcho is far removed from the kid who famously met venture capitalists in his dressing gown.Delinquency in up-and-coming businesses may be of the financial kind, however. There are no guarantees unprofitable growth companies will come good and become the quality stars of tomorrow. As noted in the Verdad study, \"paying over 10 times revenue for exciting growth stories is historically one of the worst long-term investment methodologies ever\".That's been because of their \"dramatically high failure rate and disproportionate risk of extreme multiple compression\" and, Verdad adds, \"this is true even if you exclude the dot-com bubble\", which would skew any assessment of highly valued growth stocks.In other words, probability is stacked against the investor as such purchase multiples are usually associated with businesses that have flattered to deceive and will never come good. Verdad suggests bankruptcy-level losses in companies that were similarly valued in the past occurred at such high rates that the actuarial price return risk of buying into the Bubble 500 is \"equivalent to investing exclusively in tomorrow's levered defaulters\".That reduces investing to gambling as you're hoping to find the next Amazon, Facebook, Apple or Alphabet just to avoid a blow-out. Furthermore, Verdad writes that even \"if you pick an eventual lottery ticket like the six FANMAGs, at 10 times (plus) revenue, you can still lose 80 per cent of your money on a five-year horizon due to multiple compression despite the growth\".A narrative that eats itselfAbnormally high valuations for unprofitable companies have been driven in part by the narrative around future innovation in fields such as healthcare, transport and information technology. Then there is the issue of falling real interest rates as the Federal Reserve injects hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system and has slashed the target federal funding rate close to zero.Taking the latter point first, negative real rates magnify the importance of future cash flows. Because trusted growth rates of the FANMAGs - and yet again they have rewarded investors' faith with earnings beats in the second quarter of 2020 - are effectively being treated like the coupon on a bond, the price of the tech titans rises as rates fall.Unlike a bond coupon, a company's profits fluctuate, so treating earnings yield in this way could come back to haunt investors if regulators take action to stymie the big players. That said, at least there is a clear rationale to viewing the cash-generative FANMAGs as both quality defensive and long-term steady growth plays.Stock prices have rallied on the back of the FANMAGs reporting strong second-quarter sales and profit numbers. Aggregate figures from FactSet now have these six companies trading on a weighted average of 6.1 times enterprise value to sales and 62 times price/earnings.That's a seemingly paltry earnings yield of 1.6 per cent, but given the 10-year US Treasury yield is around 0.6 per cent, that's still a premium many investors are happy with. A track record of growth and a second-quarter net income margin for the group of 19.1 per cent are reassuring signs of quality to assuage those with very reasonable concerns about valuation risk. It is worth noting, however, that the FactSet data shows analysts expect FANMAG revenues to moderate over the next two years.Where money managers like Verdad are very sceptical is on the same logic being applied to the other competing growth companies that, at the time of their report last month, were priced 40 per cent higher but aren't industry winners producing profits.FANMAG stocks a bastion of quality but will sales growth decline?<table><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col2\" namest=\"col1\">Valuation</entry><entry colname=\"col3\" nameend=\"col4\" namest=\"col3\">Growth</entry><entry colname=\"col5\" nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col5\">Profitability</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EV/Sales</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Earnings Yield (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3 yr sales CAGR (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2 yr fwd sales CAGR est (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Net Income margin (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Return on assets (%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">6.1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">19</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-13</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">19.1</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">12.8</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Source: FactSetWinner is the operative word. The narrative around technology seems to ignore the fact that half a dozen of the most successful and innovative companies of all time must be knocked off their perch, never mind how competition between smaller companies will force down selling prices, making it harder to become highly profitable.The sector composition of Verdad's Bubble 500 was fascinating, but many of the companies are operating in areas where the FANMAGs have a large and growing presence.Bubble 500 are focused on sectors where competition is fierce<table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"416\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"208\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sector</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Weight (%)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Software</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">24</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Payment processing</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Healthcare equipment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Biotech</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">14</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Reits</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">18</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Electric vehicles</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">16</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Source: Verdad</p><p>Software, payment processing, healthcare equipment, biotech and electric vehicles are described by Verdad as \"the revolutionary vanguard of the future\". They observe, somewhat wistfully, that \"the old economy, the real economy, main street - those types of companies seem to exist only to pay for application software, create transaction revenue for payment processors, and drive the network effects for [digital] marketplace companies\".</p><p>There is quite a lot in this statement to make investors question the price tag of some growth stocks. On top of having to compete with cash-rich giants that own networks and set innovation standards, they are partially dependent on demand from companies that are themselves suffering from the loss of economic activity thanks to coronavirus, and which are seeing their business models disrupted by FANMAG ubiquity.</p><p>Such factors made Verdad question if positive narratives around technologies of the future justified a 14 times revenue price tag for their Bubble 500 stocks at the time of the report, although they did acknowledge the power of momentum behind the trade. Over five years to the middle of 2020, a hypothetical Bubble 500 tracker had an average compound annual return rate of 26 per cent versus 11 per cent for the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>The big difference, of course, is that although they've got more expensive, the FANMAG stocks have also grown earnings. This is in stark contrast to the Bubble 500 stocks and Verdad is not alone in believing their growth rate won't persist.

As America's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by a record 33 per cent in the quarter, bumper earnings reported by the largest digital trailblazers emphasise the corporate inequality bothering antitrust legislators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Countless articles have opined on the sustainability of tech's profit boom and whether market valuations can be justified. But the question that shouldn't be forgotten is: with such a concentration of earnings in a few huge companies (in aggregate the six most celebrated names grew EPS quarter on quarter by almost as much as US GDP fell), what does this say about the expensiveness of other US stocks? Research conducted by Verdad, a global asset management company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, flags the worrying proportion of stocks that are priced on longer multiples of sales and earnings than tech's leading companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Out of 3,000 US stocks with a market capitalisation above $100m, Verdad identified a \"Bubble 500\" group of companies, which transverses 7 per cent of the S&amp;P 500 and a quarter of the Russell 2000 index of mid to small-cap companies.</p><p>Verdad's analysis was prior to second quarter updates being published by many companies and despite GDP contracting, US corporate earnings have on the whole surprised to the upside. Investment bank UBS notes that earnings are only down by around 35 per cent compared with the 40 per cent quarter-onquarter fall they had predicted, with four-fifths of companies surpassing expectations and a median earnings beat of 16 per cent.</p><p>That's good news for the economy going forward, but although 70 per cent of companies have beaten sales estimates, the median positive surprise of 2.8 per cent was against the dampest of forecasts. Investors should be cheered by improved trends, but some of Verdad's findings based on first-quarter numbers were startling and questions about the stretched valuations of growth stocks have still to be answered. Collectively, at the time of Verdad's report, shares in the Bubble 500 were trading at 13-14 times sales and in aggregate they were making zero profit, zero margins and zero return on assets.</p><p>Valuations for Bubble 500 companies are, observes Verdad, seemingly justified by the difference in their forward growth expectations versus the big tech stocks. Yet, with the likes of Amazon (US:AMZN) and Google's parent Alphabet (US:GOOGL) becoming players in so many industries, the largest companies present a significant competitive challenge to smaller companies the market is implying should grow fastest.</p><p>Software giant Microsoft (US:MSFT) is now being grouped with Facebook (US:FB), Amazon, Apple (US:AAPL), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Alphabet; so FANMAG is the new acronym. While the Verdad team acknowledges it is typical for smaller and younger businesses to be valued on a longer multiple of enterprise value to sales, the market is asking a lot of such companies.</p><p>Verdad writes that \"we feel it's shocking to consider that only very rarely have any of the surviving sample of today's FANMAG winners traded above 10 times revenue\". Expanding on a salient point, it continues: \"We seem to be paying even more today for a broad bucket of unprofitable hopefuls than we were willing to pay for the FANMAG archetypes before they survived and won their near-monopoly status.\"</p><p>That status was subject to scrutiny by a US congressional hearing last week, with four of the chief executives - Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook of Apple and Amazon's JeffBezos - taking turns to be questioned by remote conference.</p><p>Perhaps the committee appreciates the irony; technology pioneered by these companies enables the grilling of their chief executives, mid-pandemic. The sight of Mr Zuckerberg in a suit is a reminder they are dealing with former upstarts that have matured into the main breadwinners of the Nasdaq exchange. These days Facebook's head honcho is far removed from the kid who famously met venture capitalists in his dressing gown.</p><p>Delinquency in up-and-coming businesses may be of the financial kind, however. There are no guarantees unprofitable growth companies will come good and become the quality stars of tomorrow. As noted in the Verdad study, \"paying over 10 times revenue for exciting growth stories is historically one of the worst long-term investment methodologies ever\".</p><p>That's been because of their \"dramatically high failure rate and disproportionate risk of extreme multiple compression\" and, Verdad adds, \"this is true even if you exclude the dot-com bubble\", which would skew any assessment of highly valued growth stocks.</p><p>In other words, probability is stacked against the investor as such purchase multiples are usually associated with businesses that have flattered to deceive and will never come good. Verdad suggests bankruptcy-level losses in companies that were similarly valued in the past occurred at such high rates that the actuarial price return risk of buying into the Bubble 500 is \"equivalent to investing exclusively in tomorrow's levered defaulters\".</p><p>That reduces investing to gambling as you're hoping to find the next Amazon, Facebook, Apple or Alphabet just to avoid a blow-out. Furthermore, Verdad writes that even \"if you pick an eventual lottery ticket like the six FANMAGs, at 10 times (plus) revenue, you can still lose 80 per cent of your money on a five-year horizon due to multiple compression despite the growth\".</p><p>A narrative that eats itself Abnormally high valuations for unprofitable companies have been driven in part by the narrative around future innovation in fields such as healthcare, transport and information technology. Then there is the issue of falling real interest rates as the Federal Reserve injects hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system and has slashed the target federal funding rate close to zero.</p><p>Taking the latter point first, negative real rates magnify the importance of future cash flows. Because trusted growth rates of the FANMAGs - and yet again they have rewarded investors' faith with earnings beats in the second quarter of 2020 - are effectively being treated like the coupon on a bond, the price of the tech titans rises as rates fall.</p><p>Unlike a bond coupon, a company's profits fluctuate, so treating earnings yield in this way could come back to haunt investors if regulators take action to stymie the big players. That said, at least there is a clear rationale to viewing the cash-generative FANMAGs as both quality defensive and long-term steady growth plays.</p><p>Stock prices have rallied on the back of the FANMAGs reporting strong second-quarter sales and profit numbers. Aggregate figures from FactSet now have these six companies trading on a weighted average of 6.1 times enterprise value to sales and 62 times price/earnings.</p><p>That's a seemingly paltry earnings yield of 1.6 per cent, but given the 10-year US Treasury yield is around 0.6 per cent, that's still a premium many investors are happy with. A track record of growth and a secondquarter net income margin for the group of 19.1 per cent are reassuring signs of quality to assuage those with very reasonable concerns about valuation risk. It is worth noting, however, that the FactSet data shows analysts expect FANMAG revenues to moderate over the next two years.</p><p>Where money managers like Verdad are very sceptical is on the same logic being applied to the other competing growth companies that, at the time of their report last month, were priced 40 per cent higher but aren't industry winners producing profits.</p><p>Winner is the operative word. The narrative around technology seems to ignore the fact that half a dozen of the most successful and innovative companies of all time must be knocked offtheir perch, never mind how competition between smaller companies will force down selling prices, making it harder to become highly profitable.</p><p>The sector composition of Verdad's Bubble 500 was fascinating, but many of the companies are operating in areas where the FANMAGs have a large and growing presence.</p><p>Software, payment processing, healthcare equipment, biotech and electric vehicles are described by Verdad as \"the revolutionary vanguard of the future\". They observe, somewhat wistfully, that \"the old economy, the real economy, main street - those types of companies seem to exist only to pay for application software, create transaction revenue for payment processors, and drive the network effects for [digital] marketplace companies\".</p><p>There is quite a lot in this statement to make investors question the price tag of some growth stocks. On top of having to compete with cash-rich giants that own networks and set innovation standards, they are partially dependent on demand from companies that are themselves suffering from the loss of economic activity thanks to coronavirus, and which are seeing their business models disrupted by FANMAG ubiquity.</p><p>Such factors made Verdad question if positive narratives around technologies of the future justified a 14 times revenue price tag for their Bubble 500 stocks at the time of the report, although they did acknowledge the power of momentum behind the trade. Over five years to the middle of 2020, a hypothetical Bubble 500 tracker had an average compound annual return rate of 26 per cent versus 11 per cent for the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>The big difference, of course, is that although they've got more expensive, the FANMAG stocks have also grown earnings. This is in stark contrast to the Bubble 500 stocks and Verdad is not alone in believing their growth rate won't persist. It noted over a 7 per cent short interest as a percentage of the float for the average stock in its Bubble 500 list. Some were among the most shorted stocks on the market.</p><p/><p>US GDP SHRANK BY A RECO RD 33 PER</p><p>CENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER</p><p>33%</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Stock prices have rallied on the back of the FANMAGs reporting strong second-quarter sales and profits</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-162164160</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HY-H3R1-DYTY-C1W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 7, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

A lot going on, as always.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new investigation of Google uncovers how employees of the sinister tech monopoly once again discussed ways to censor your political views without your knowledge. Nobody in Congress seems to think this as a problem. These new details might change their minds, fingers crossed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, yesterday, we told you how Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer has made the banned list for bullying, and other imaginary moral crimes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, the Victorians have another target, the salacious Christmas song, Baby, It's Cold Outside. It turns out some of the lyrics in that tune are naughty, and you should not be allowed to hear them. The Liberal Sherpa joins us later to explain why.</p><p>But first tonight, it's been 752 days since the 2016 election. And for what seems like the 752nd day in a row, the lead story in every news outlet in this country is Russia.</p><p>Yes, Russia, a remote country in Central Asia with a median life expectancy lower than that of Honduras. A place with an economy about the size of that of the State of Texas, a vodka-soaked icescape (ph), whose shuffling workforce can't seem to build a reliable airplane, that's Russia.</p><p>But nevertheless, it's a place that somehow, against all odds, manages to dictate election outcomes on the other side of the world, using a crack team of Secret Agents, so stealthy, we still don't know their names after more than two years of investigating it. Russia.</p><p>According to cable news, Russia is the most important country in the world. Today's installment of the Russia saga has something to do with Michael Cohen and a potential real estate deal in Moscow. Now, the deal never actually happened, not that would have made any difference, had it happened. Foreign investment is still legal, even in Russia, but whatever.</p><p>This is a huge, huge deal, the hugest deal. It changes everything forever. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RON INSANA, SENIOR ANALYST &amp; COMMENTATOR, CNBC: This President may not serve out his term that -- that Bob Mueller may have enough that there's both intense legal and intense political jeopardy for the President of the United States.</p><p>JEFFREY ROSS TOOBIN, LEGAL ANALYST, CNN AND THE NEW YORKER: You know, today's the first day I actually thought Donald Trump might not finish his term in office.</p><p>ANDERSON HAYS COOPER, AUTHOR, PRIMARY ANCHOR, ANDERSON COOPER 360 , CNN: Really?</p><p>TOOBIN: I mean I think this thing is enormous.</p><p>JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: Today is a good day for Donald Trump to resign. I really believe that.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: This thing is enormous. He's resigning. So, once again, the Administration is doomed because of Russia. We'll see.</p><p>What's remarkable though is that for the past couple of years, as the geniuses on cable television has -- have been sounding the relentless alarm about our mortal foe, Vladimir Putin, an actual threat to America has been rising in the East.</p><p>If you're looking for a country to fret about, forget about Russia. The Russians may pose a threat to Montenegro and Ukraine, but Phoenix and Buffalo remain safe. The real danger to this country is China, and everybody in power knows that.</p><p>The FBI Director, Christopher Wray, describes China as by far the biggest espionage threat we face. Federal officials estimate there are thousands of Chinese nationals in America right now, acting as spies, working to steal sensitive U.S. technologies.</p><p>Some of these work for the Chinese military, which, by the way, is growing at a much faster rate than our military or, for that matter, Russia's. Meanwhile, China is literally poisoning the American population.</p><p>Synthetic opioids are the main driver of the drug epidemic that has killed more than 70,000 Americans in just the last year. China is the biggest source of these drugs. The Chinese government has done virtually nothing to stop the flow of them. Why would they? This is war, and they're winning.</p><p>Now, you might think our media would have noticed all of this and maybe written a story or two about it. But, no. Many of them, it turns out, are on the Chinese payroll too.</p><p>Vox.com recently published a nauseatingly sycophantic piece written by a reporter who had just traveled to China, it turns out, on the Chinese government's dime.</p><p>Over at Jeff Bezos' Washington Post, you'll periodically see an entire insert called China Watch. It looks like a news section. It reads like the rest of the paper.</p><p>In fact, it's literally a product of Chinese state media. They paid to place it, just as they paid and influenced numerous think tanks around Washington, as well as many colleges and universities throughout the country. It's a huge propaganda push that is almost never noted by anybody, and it costs a lot. But over time, it's worth it.</p><p>The Chinese get what they pay for, a compliant American establishment that uses fake threats, manufactured threats from Russia to obscure real and imminent threats from China. Turns out, there really are traitors in Washington, but they're not working for the Kremlin.</p><p>Julian Epstein is a former Chief Counsel for Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, and he joins us tonight. So, Julian, you and I both live in Washington, and we know personally a lot of people who are in effect on the Chinese payroll.</p><p>Madeleine Albright has made a lot of money from China. John Boehner, the former Republican Speaker, works for a firm that lobbies for China. Jim Wolfensohn, who ran the World Bank, advises the Chinese Sovereign Wealth Fund, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p><p>How many people do you know who are openly working for Russia in Washington?</p><p>JULIAN EPSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER CHIEF DEMOCRATIC COUNSEL TO HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I think your basic point that the Chinese are a greater long-term threat to us than Russia is, I think, that's true. I think in the 1970s, China had about 1 percent of the flows of world trade. They now have about 25 percent.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: They have about 2 percent of the global economy. And within the decade, they will be equal to the size of the U.S. economy. By 2050, they will be twice the size of the U.S. economy.</p><p>I think we thought, when we brought them into the World Trade Organization in -- in 2001, that it would help them play fair. And I think what we've seen since then is that they've cheated. They've stolen intellectual property.</p><p>Up until 2014, they were certainly manipulating the currency. I don't think they play by the rules. And I think one of the things I agree with the President on is to get tough with China. I would approach it differently than he does. But I think he's right to get tough on China.</p><p>I think the media ought to focus more on it. It's not as sensational, so it's not going to get good ratings on cable television, but it's a real problem. The disappearing middle class and working class is a real problem.</p><p>It's not sensational. It's not going to be a sugar-high for cable television, so you -- I don't think you're going to have any of the networks, not this network, not CNN, not MSNBC, any of them focusing on those issues because you just don't get the sugar-high from that.</p><p>That's not to say Russia isn't a threat. I mean Russia has done lots of things. All of our intelligence agencies and Republican and Democratic Administrations have agreed--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --that even though they're 1 percent in the world economy, they still do lots of things that are directly oppositional to us, and that are trying to destabilize our interests--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --whether it's in the Middle East, whether it's in Syria, whether it's in the Balkans, whether it's in the U.K. It doesn't mean that they're not a real threat, and there's not something to take seriously.</p><p>But I think your basic point is correct, which is that we are sleeping while Rome burns with respect to China, and we have not taken seriously the fact that they don't play by the rules. We have, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, so I'm -- I'm waiting to jump in with a hostile question, but you're making my case for me. You've taken--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: I -- well I -- I agree--</p><p>CARLSON: --all of my questions and reformatted them into--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --I agree with--</p><p>CARLSON: --statements because I think you're absolutely right. So -- so, I guess--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --I agree with the metathesis. I agree with--</p><p>CARLSON: --well OK. Because I think--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --the metathesis.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's hard to -- and thank you for being honest about that. And I -- by the way, it's not a partisan thing. There are a ton of Republicans working on behalf of China, I'm embarrassed to say.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: And Democrats are finally waking up, I think, that there is a real threat that China does not play by the rules, and that it's something to take very seriously. Again--</p><p>CARLSON: So, so, so but I wonder though--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --I would approach it differently than the President. But--</p><p>CARLSON: --but--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --I think he's right to say this is a real problem.</p><p>CARLSON: --but there's all this moral outrage about Russia and Saudi Arabia, neither of which I've ever been in favor of, by the way. I'm not carrying water for either one. But the idea that a country we are allied with assassinates one of its political opponents, yes, it's bad.</p><p>But, I mean, that is a practically (ph) daily occurrence in China, and no one says anything about it. And I just wonder, should we treat the people in Washington, who have a lot of power, who are getting rich from China, should we treat them as traitors in the same way that we treat anyone who deals with Russia as a traitor?</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: I -- look, I think your point about even-handedness is well- taken. I think the Chinese do horrible things to journalists and to dissidents and they -- and they get a pass on it.</p><p>I think, in a lot of cases, the social media giants, Facebook and Google, enable a lot of the bad behavior that's going on in a lot of autocratic regimes. We don't hear that much about it although that's starting to get covered.</p><p>I think if your point is proportionality, it -- does the news, and particularly cable news, does it cover these things in the proper proportionality? I agree with that meta-point that you're making.</p><p>It doesn't mean to say that when the Saudis go and kill an American journalist, we shouldn't be getting tough on the Saudis. It doesn't mean to say if the Russians create a military intelligence attack on the United States that that's not something we shouldn't--</p><p>CARLSON: No, and I'm not arguing that.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --take seriously and we shouldn't -- and we should get to the bottom of that. But I think your basic point is that, you know, there is selective outrage. There is a lot of chest-thumping.</p><p>There is a lot of kind of, you know, morally superior indignation that -- that occurs on the Russia issue. And, you know, I -- you and I may have slightly different views on the Russian issue--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm trying to argue with you, Julian Epstein--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --but--</p><p>CARLSON: --but it's -- it's proving absolutely impossible.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --but -- but--</p><p>CARLSON: You did a better job than I could have--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --but, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: --in making that case.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --there -- there's lot of self-righteousness--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, tell me about it.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --on certain issues. And I -- I think there's reason to be upset about what happened with Russia. There's reason to be upset with Saudi Arabia. But I think if you're going to be outraged on those issues, your point is correct that you should be equally outraged--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --on the abuses--</p><p>CARLSON: All right (ph). And -- and that's it--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --that are occurring--</p><p>CARLSON: --right there.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --in China. And the accusers (ph) in -- in China are very, very serious, and you're exactly right about that.</p><p>CARLSON: Julian Epstein, thank you very much.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: OK. Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Unexpected. Appreciate it.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: Good to see you, Tucker. OK.</p><p>CARLSON: Gordon Chang has been thinking about these questions for a very long time. He's the Author of The Coming Collapse of China, and he joins us. So, Gordon, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>Put this into perspective, if you would. To what extent, do you think, the Chinese government influences American policy?</p><p>GORDON GUTHRIE CHANG, COLUMNIST, BLOGGER, TELEVISION PUNDIT, LAWYER, THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA AUTHOR: Oh, certainly across the board. We saw it during this midterm elections, the Chinese tried to influence outcomes.</p><p>And they did it with not only that famous Des Moines Register's four-page insert. But they also summoned the heads of Wall Street firms to Beijing for that September 16th meeting. You go on and on about the types of things that they've been doing.</p><p>CARLSON: Let -- let me -- let me -- let me pause there for our viewers who don't know what you're referring to. September 16th, they, as you put it, summoned the Heads of Wall Street firms to Beijing to do what?</p><p>CHANG: To talk about the midterm elections, to talk about tariffs, to talk about the trade relationship because Beijing was very, very concerned about what the Trump Administration is doing to impose costs on China, because it is causing problems in the Chinese economy, which is under stress.</p><p>So, they said, \"Look, we're holding this meeting. We want you there.\" And a lot of people from Wall Street actually took the flight to Beijing.</p><p>CARLSON: American citizens--</p><p>CHANG: American citizens.</p><p>CARLSON: --summoned by the Communist Chinese government actually went?</p><p>CHANG: They actually went and they held that meeting. And, you know, this shows the power of Beijing, and it shows that they were trying to change the results in the election.</p><p>Now, I don't think that it would -- had any real effect. And the reason is, as Julian and you have talked about, across the American political spectrum right now, people are starting to understand the fundamental nature of the challenge that China poses to us.</p><p>And it's certainly much greater challenge than Russia, because Russia couldn't challenge the U.S., if it weren't for being backstopped by the Chinese.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. So, I mean you've got to think of Russia as sort of a -- a drunk troublemaker that can kind of, you know, make some prank calls. But in the end, China's economy is about to become, as Julian just noted correctly, larger than ours. So, like, why aren't we completely freaked out about our future about this (ph)?</p><p>CHANG: Well we should be because the Chinese are taking hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. intellectual property each year by theft or by force transfer. And -- and that is the lifeblood of our economy because we have an innovation-based economy.</p><p>And if we can't commercialize our technology, we don't have an economy. We end up just selling agricultural products to the world and maybe scrap metal.</p><p>The point is though we need to have the technological giants that will dominate the future of the world's economy. They should be American. And China, by means which are certainly not fair, is trying to do that.</p><p>And one other thing, Tucker, you mentioned Fentanyl and opioid crisis. You know, the Chinese government runs a police state. They know about these Chinese gangs that are selling Fentanyl into the U.S.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CHANG: And so, those gangs couldn't operate unless they had Beijing's approval. Now, officials on China are making money from it and, in other cases, the Chinese officials are just standing back. But they purposely want to see Americans die. And we can't forget that.</p><p>CARLSON: Tens of thousands of Americans do die every year because of synthetic opioids manufactured in China. And yet, I can't remember the last time I heard someone in our political class say that out loud. Why?</p><p>CHANG: Well I -- I think that is because there's -- there's a lot of reasons.</p><p>Part of it is because a lot of people are actually getting money from China. A number of reasons for other people is that they sort of believe that we should be engaging the Chinese, you know, this is the Nixon policy of trying to work with Beijing, so that it's not on the outside of the international system.</p><p>And that sounds nice but it hasn't worked over four decades. We've tried all sorts of things, and -- and it hasn't worked. We've tried negotiation, engagement. We did all those things. And, unfortunately, the Chinese behavior in the economy and in other things has just gotten worse.</p><p>CARLSON: Gordon Chang, thank you very much for that.</p><p>CHANG: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p>Well employees at Google just got caught, once again, plotting to suppress political views they don't like. We have details on that, after the break.</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>CARLSON: More evidence that the sinister tech monopoly, Google, is not on the level, not at all what it claims to be. New leaked communications from inside that company show that Google employees discussed suppressing Conservative news websites in their search engine right after the 2016 election.</p><p>In one post from November 9th, 2016, a Google Engineer, called Scott Byer, called The Daily Caller and Breitbart, \"opinion blogs,\" and said that Google employees should reduce the visibility of both sites in search results compared to, \"Legitimate news organizations.\" Other employees said it was the company's job to provide more \"Context\" to rebut news outlets they dislike.</p><p>Robert Epstein is a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, and one of the people who's paid closest attention to the power that Google has. Mr. Epstein, thanks very much for coming on tonight.</p><p>So, Google has said repeatedly that it does not manipulate search results. And yet, this is not the first, not even close to the first piece of evidence we have from within the company showing Google employees discussing ways to manipulate search results. Can we be confident they're not doing it?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: Not at all. You know, Google is extremely good at keeping its secrets for almost 20 years. But, in the last few months, that has changed, and there have been quite a number of leaks.</p><p>And we have seen a number of internal discussions there like the one that you just described. And there's simply no question that they have very strong political leanings. 95 percent of donations there go to Democrats.</p><p>I myself am not a Conservative. I actually--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: --I -- I -- I kind of lean toward Google's political views. But it's -- it's frightening to me because of what I study day by day. It's frightening to me that this company, with very strong political leanings, has the power to shift millions of votes, to shift opinions on a massive scale without people knowing that they're doing it and without being accountable to the public.</p><p>CARLSON: How can you have a democracy under those circumstances where one privately-held company has the power to manipulate people's behavior without people knowing it?</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: Well that's what I'm saying. And that's exactly what's happening here, and the situation gets even worse when -- when these huge tech companies, the two largest being Google and Facebook, when they both have the same political leanings.</p><p>So, you know, in that kind of scenario, we're talking about the ability to shift in the midterm elections, I calculated, upwards of 12 million votes with no one having any idea that they're doing this. This is not like fake ads where -- which you can see.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: This is invisible manipulation. I -- I literally have to invent new names for the techniques they're using because they've never existed before.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Google assures us that they're not doing this because they're good people, much better people than we are, for example. How can we know if they're telling the truth? And should we believe them?</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: Oh well, they're -- they're sure they're good people. That's part of the problem. They have a kind of Utopian thinking within the company, not just among the employees but, you know, their top executives think like Utopians.</p><p>So, there -- there -- believe me, they believe that they are doing good for humanity, good for -- good for the United States by imposing their values, their thinking on the rest of us. The problem is, as I say, that they can do it in ways that have never existed before in human history.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I know that -- as you already said, you and I have different political views, probably don't vote for the same people, so you're maybe the person to ask.</p><p>How can the United States Congress sit back with evidence that democracy, the core idea of democracy, is being challenged by this company, and not do anything about it?</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: Well, the Democrats aren't going to do anything because these companies help them, obviously. The Republicans don't like regulations. So, we have a tough problem here in the U.S.</p><p>Now, the Europeans, on the other hand, you know, they -- they see these companies as American, and so, there have been -- they've been much tougher on them.</p><p>And I think we're going to see -- we're going to see some pretty drastic actions taken against these companies by the EU in the next few years. And that could change their ability to operate worldwide.</p><p>CARLSON: I never thought I'd be waiting for France and Germany to come to our rescue but that's -- that's where we are, unfortunately. Mr. Epstein, thank you very much. It was great, as always.</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Harmeet Dhillon is an attorney who has frequently, at cost to herself, stood up to big tech, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you very much for--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --coming on tonight.</p><p>So, this, again, as I just heard (ph) Mr. Epstein, yet another example of evidence from within this company, and there are other examples like it from Facebook, that show that they're not on the level, that they're lying to us, and that they could undermine the very basis of our democracy.</p><p>Let me ask you the same question. Why is Congress standing by in the face of this evidence and doing nothing?</p><p>DHILLON: Let me add to that, why is the Department of Justice not opening up anti-trust investigations?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, exactly.</p><p>DHILLON: Why is the Federal Trade Commission not investigating them for their deceptive trade practices and failure to disclose their manipulation of data and theft of data from Americans and others?</p><p>So, today itself, the European Union opened up a new, its fourth in the last two years' investigation into Google for anti-trust issues for manipulating search. Guess what? And so far, they've been fined $7.1 billion in Europe in the last 17 months, but zippo here in the United States on the same issues.</p><p>And one of the reasons, Tucker, is that these companies, both of them are very adept at spreading money around Capitol Hill, including through the use of a former Republican Congresswoman, Susan Molinari, and those are their lobbyists, and they're very effective.</p><p>That's why you see legislators backing off for the most part. But we are talking about fascistic, you know, control of our data in a way that is perceived as benevolent by -- certainly by Liberals and is not being criticized at all by the Right. I think it's a very dangerous situation.</p><p>CARLSON: So, but what's the point? I mean, just as (ph) a macro question, what's the point of having a government, of sending half your income every year to Washington, if they won't protect you from the most basic and obvious threat to our entire system, which is these companies? Why do we have a government if they won't stand up to Google and Facebook?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, interestingly, I think we're going to see some action on the part of these companies, against these companies, I should say, in the new Congress because Liberals are concerned about the data theft much more so than Conservatives are.</p><p>But we're still not going to see anything about this bias in terms of viewpoint. In addition to what you've covered on your segment tonight so far, obviously, there's suppression of -- of YouTube videos on an ideological basis.</p><p>Google also discourages its advertisers from advertising on Conservative platforms like Breitbart and others. Google's search engine has labeled the California Republican Party as having Nazi ideology and Republican Women as -- as being enablers.</p><p>It is the most despicable, defamatory work, and it is all protected by the Communications Decency Act, which members of Congress certainly could edit and change, but they don't. And so, I'm very disappointed in our government, our Conservative government, frankly, and Washington on its failure to act on these issues.</p><p>CARLSON: So, as you just pointed out, very quickly, these companies operate in the way that they do very profitably because they have a special exemption from the Congress, which could revoke that exemption because they're not platforms. They're media companies. Of course, they're editing.</p><p>Can -- name just, if you would, since we're live now, three or four Members of Congress who, you know, might lead the charge against this?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, actually I guess, I don't think any Members of Congress currently have identified themselves as being hostile to this. But, you know, Jim Jordan certainly seems to be somebody who's familiar with these issues. Matt Gaetz is another.</p><p>I think these guys are sensitive to these issues. But -- and I don't think they're beholden to big tech. You know, maybe they haven't been there long enough to have that sink in yet.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: But -- but we have -- we have had Senators, Mike Lee, for example, has looked at the anti-trust situation, and then backed off. I'd like to see our Senate newly constituted with more votes take a hard look at this, have some hearings, really put them on the spot.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: Sundar Pichai is going to be testifying in Congress next week. I have suggested that definitely some hard questions need to be asked. And I know that there are certainly -- there's an intention to ask some hard questions next week so--</p><p>CARLSON: I hope that happens.</p><p>DHILLON: --we'll see what happens.</p><p>CARLSON: Hope they get moving. Harmeet Dhillon, you've been brave on this question. We're -- we're grateful for it. Thank you.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a man who says he was trying to blow the whistle on the Uranium One deal, remember that, says the FBI repaid him by raiding his house. That story's after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, here's an interesting story you may not have seen. FBI agents raided the home of a Uranium One whistleblower. That's according to a new report by The Daily Caller News Foundation.</p><p>A man called Dennis Nathan Cain has turned over documents to the DoJ as well as to the both House and Senate Intel committees. The documents allegedly show that federal officials failed to investigate possible criminal activity involving the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One deal.</p><p>Now, Cain says, the FBI repaid him by sending 16 agents to raid his house for six hours.</p><p>Dan Bongino is a former Secret Service Agent, NRATV contributor, and Author of Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump. He joins us tonight. Dan, thanks a lot for coming on. So, this is a remarkable--</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE, FORMER NYPD OFFICER, NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is one of those stories I personally don't want to believe could be true that we live in a country where the FBI is used to carry out political grudges. How do you assess this?</p><p>BONGINO: Well, Tucker, I don't want to believe that, either. Having been a former Federal Agent myself, this is deeply disturbing. But there's -- there's a -- there's -- is a bifurcated way to look at this right now. And I'll just -- I'll just sum it up like this. This is either really, really bad for the Clintons or really, really bad for the FBI, meaning this. You don't typically raid a whistleblower's house. The whole idea of being a whistleblower is you're providing information voluntarily to assist law enforcement or the government.</p><p>Why you would raid the house is puzzling to a lot of people? Some people believe that this could be really bad for the Clintons and be kind of a tying up of the Clinton Foundation case that appears to be being investigated by John Huber right now, the United States attorney.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BONGINO: On the other hand, Tucker, listen, the people involved in this Uranium One case, the Rosatom and the 10x (ph) case are all people who are knee-deep in the Spygate saga. That -- that's just a fact. That's not a conspiracy theory. It's just true.</p><p>Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, was the prosecuting United States Attorney on the precursor case to Uranium One, that disaster, Bob Mueller was the FBI Director.</p><p>So, forgive me for not being willing to give everybody a pass on a suspicious raid on a whistleblower's pass. It's just a matter of fact. I -- I guess I should say it this way. I'm not taking anybody at their word any more, and neither should you, either. We should ask questions on this.</p><p>CARLSON: But what's so surprising is who's not asking questions about this. So, for generations, the Left elevated the idea of whistleblowing to -- to -- to a sanctified place. Whistleblowers were protected. They are protected in law, and they're protected because Liberals wanted them protected.</p><p>And yet, I haven't heard anybody in the Left complain about the FBI raid on this guy's house. Why is that?</p><p>BONGINO: Tucker, listen, the -- the -- the rage at -- at Donald Trump has - - has this -- you have brought this up on your show so many times, it can't be highlighted enough.</p><p>The Left, which previously aligned with groups like the American Civil Liberties Union that was actually interested, at one point, no more, apparently, in defending civil liberties has--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BONGINO: --completely abandoned that now. They have now flipped the script entirely to actually defending weaponized government.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>BONGINO: It is unbelievable the transformation we've seen. There's -- listen, it's not in dispute that there are serious abnormalities in the way the Donald Trump investigation was conducted, the Trump team investigation, and the way the Clinton investigation and the Uranium One investigations were sidelined.</p><p>But nobody's even remotely curious on the Left about this. It's really incredible, because, Tucker, as you know with government, some day it turns on you too. Government--</p><p>CARLSON: It's exactly right.</p><p>BONGINO: --doesn't respect party. It's all about power.</p><p>CARLSON: It's unwise. Very unwise.</p><p>Dan Bongino, thank you, as always, have a great weekend.</p><p>BONGINO: Thanks, Tucker. You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, as you well know, dozens of U.S. cities have decided they're not going to enforce federal immigration law because they don't feel like it. And that's OK with the Left.</p><p>Now, one Police Chief is looking to apply the very same standard to gun control laws. How much support is he going to get? He joins us next.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, Merry Christmas from General Motors. The car company just announced plans to lay off 15,000 workers and shut down major factories in the states of Michigan, Maryland, and Ohio.</p><p>Now, the cuts are coming despite the fact that General Motors has posted nearly $3 billion in profit just last quarter. Workers at one soon-to-be- closed plant told The Wall Street Journal that they were quote, blindsided by the decision. They didn't know it was coming.</p><p>One person who will not be struggling to pay for Christmas presents this year is General Motors CEO, Mary Barra. She made nearly $22 million in the last year. That makes her the industry's highest-paid CEO. Toyota's CEO, by stark comparison, makes less than $4 million a year, even though he runs a far more successful company.</p><p>Now, what has Mary Barra done to earn all that money? Well, as CEO, she's laid off thousands of workers. She shut down plants and overseen the recall of tens of millions of defective vehicles.</p><p>A few years ago, she was forced to testify to Congress about faulty ignition switches that killed more than a hundred drivers. In modern corporate America, that is considered a deeply successful record. Give that woman a raise. Of course, if GM is serious about cutting cost, there is one obvious solution, fire Mary Barra.</p><p>Well, for years, Liberal cities and states have been claiming the right to ignore federal immigration law. Now, one small town Police Chief in Washington State is saying the same principle can be applied to far- reaching gun laws.</p><p>A new gun control ordinance in Washington imposes stricter background checks, raises the age for buying a semi-automatic rifle, and allows gun owners to be criminally prosecuted if their firearms are stolen, and then used illegally.</p><p>Loren Culp is the Police Chief of Republic, Washington, and says that he wants his town to be a sanctuary from these new gun laws. Some local residents oppose the new measure in Washington. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Opponents say it forces gun owners to secure them in a way that could put them in danger.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm concerned that not being able to access my gun when I need it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're not going to tell the criminal, can you hold on a moment because we have a law that I have to, you know, safe -- safely store it in the garage somewhere and, you know, in a -- and so, can you hold on a moment. I'm going to go take it. And I'm going to defend myself. Then, we'll talk.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You call the police or -- or things go down, it's less than one minute, so those seconds count.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Police Chief Loren Culp joins us tonight by Skype. Chief, thanks very much for coming on. It's good to see you.</p><p>LOREN CULP, REPUBLIC, WASHINGTON, POLICE CHIEF: Good evening, Tucker, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is this, in effect, a -- a sanctuary, your town, Republic, Washington, from the gun laws of your state?</p><p>CULP: I have suggested an ordinance and recommended it to the City Council. And they're in the process of reviewing that, and doing their due diligence, to see if they want to pass that. But as far as the Police Department goes, we will not be enforcing that.</p><p>CARLSON: So, cities that have decided to ignore federal -- federal immigration law have received the applause and support of almost everyone on the American Left. What do you think the response will be if your town passes this ordinance?</p><p>CULP: I don't think the same people would be very happy. The thing about it is illegal immigrants aren't covered by the Bill of Rights in the Constitution, and gun owners are.</p><p>CARLSON: A very good point. So what do -- what will happen next, do you think? Will the Governor of the State try and force you to enforce the law that you think is unconstitutional?</p><p>CULP: Well, I don't know how it could, Tucker, because we live in a Constitutional Republic, contrary to what a lot of people tell us that we live in a democracy. But we have the rule of law in this state and across the United States. And the Constitution is the law of the land.</p><p>And everybody knows what the Second Amendment says. A lot of your viewers might not know what the Washington State Constitution says about firearms. But really quickly, it says the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the State shall not be impaired.</p><p>So, that's even more explicit than the Second Amendment. So, I -- I don't know how they can get around that and try to force me to go against my Oath of Office to uphold that.</p><p>CARLSON: Interesting. I had no idea your state's Constitution said that. It's -- it sounds like it's being already ignored throughout the State of Washington. So, very quickly, this State law would require gun owners to keep their guns locked up at all times?</p><p>CULP: It requires you to keep it locked up because if someone gains access to your gun, say, you're -- you're away from home and someone breaks into your home and steals your gun, goes out and commits a crime with it, you can be charged up to a felony for that person getting your gun and committing a crime with it.</p><p>CARLSON: If someone--</p><p>CULP: Absolutely ridiculous.</p><p>CARLSON: --if someone steals--</p><p>CULP: It's like charging--</p><p>CARLSON: --your car--</p><p>CULP: --charging someone who has her car stolen and the person drives off and goes through a crowd of people.</p><p>CARLSON: Huh.</p><p>CULP: It -- it's ridiculous.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that is ridiculous. And good for you for fighting back against it. Chief Culp, thank you very much for coming on and explaining that. Appreciate it.</p><p>CULP: Tucker, I have a real quick message for you, though.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>CULP: Ted Nugent (ph) told me to tell you hi.</p><p>CARLSON: Always a welcome message especially on a Friday. Thank you. Thank you, Chief. Good to see you.</p><p>CULP: Good night, thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, there's no war on Christmas. That's like some Right-wing trope that only dumb people believe. Meanwhile, the war on Christmas continues apace. Yesterday, it was Rudolph. Today, it's something else and we'll tell you what it is. Stay tuned.</p><p>TEXT: THE LIBERAL SHERPA.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the forces of darkness rung in the holiday season with an attack on Rudolph, the Red-Nose Reindeer. That was at HuffPo. But those attacks have expanded to a more familiar line of attack, the classic holiday song, Baby, It's Cold Outside.</p><p>Cleveland Radio Station, WDOK, has dropped that song from its Christmas lineup after a listener called in to complain that it was inappropriate, somehow, in the wake of the #MeToo movement.</p><p>How about fat-shaming songs about Santa Claus? Will be -- they be the next to go? Here to explain it, The Liberal Sherpa, Catalina Magazine Founder, Cathy Areu.</p><p>Cathy Areu, great to see you tonight.</p><p>CATHERINE AREU, FOUNDING PUBLISHER, CATALINA MAGAZINE: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: It does seem like a lot of the songs about Santa make reference to his weight in a way that is not very sensitive.</p><p>AREU: I don't think he minds. I mean, he's jolly, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: He's a jolly guy.</p><p>CARLSON: Baby, It's Cold Outside. Is that song (ph)--</p><p>AREU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --we need to give up because of #MeToo?</p><p>AREU: Not because of #MeToo. I -- I looked at it and it seems like a few years back, people were commenting that the lyrics--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: --if you read those lyrics, it's not a holiday song.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>AREU: It doesn't say holidays, happy holidays, Christmas, anything. It's just cold outside. And an older man is telling a younger woman not to go home to her parents, to stay around, have another drink. And she says, \"What's in this drink?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: He says, \"Don't worry about it.\" She said, \"I feel kind of funny.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: \"Let's stick around.\" So, if you read it--</p><p>CARLSON: She's getting roofied.</p><p>AREU: --yes, apparently, he slipped something in the drink, and she stays the night.</p><p>CARLSON: Do we get to a point where human worth, warmth, and romance, are illegal?</p><p>AREU: That's not romance. This is a guy slipping her something and she's spending the night, and she doesn't know what happened.</p><p>CARLSON: And yet, for 50 years, she never complained about it. I guess she never knew how perfect (ph) she was.</p><p>AREU: She did. She said, \"I'm trying to say no, no, no.\" The song explains it. She's saying, \"No,\" in the song.</p><p>CARLSON: When--</p><p>AREU: No means no, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --when Mommy kisses Santa Claus--</p><p>AREU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --has consent been given?</p><p>AREU: When Mommy kisses Santa? I -- I -- it sounds like Mommy was OK with that. She didn't--</p><p>CARLSON: Really? This fat guy--</p><p>AREU: --say no, no, no.</p><p>CARLSON: --comes down your chimney, shows up in your living room and kisses Mommy, and that's voluntary, you're saying.</p><p>AREU: I mean the cheek. Wasn't it on the--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, no, I don't -- I don't. But -- no, I don't--</p><p>AREU: --cheek.</p><p>CARLSON: --think so.</p><p>AREU: Oh, OK, because it's not--</p><p>CARLSON: Would Frosty, the Snowperson--</p><p>AREU: --specified there (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --be a more inclusive title, do you think?</p><p>AREU: I think so, yes. Man, you know, that's--</p><p>CARLSON: Does the phrase White Christmas--</p><p>AREU: --inappropriate, I mean.</p><p>CARLSON: --strike you as racist?</p><p>AREU: Snow is white, so it's appropriate.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: Yellow snow--</p><p>CARLSON: It doesn't seem problematic in the slightest?</p><p>AREU: I don't think so. I mean--</p><p>CARLSON: When White people sing Feliz Navidad, is that cultural appropriation?</p><p>AREU: It depends, right? If they sing it with a sombrero, and they're mocking at the culture then, perhaps, yes--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>AREU: --they've crossed the line.</p><p>CARLSON: But if they sing it just humming along--</p><p>AREU: And appreciating it. And appreciating the song--</p><p>CARLSON: --the sound track at Walmart, that's OK?</p><p>AREU: --if they appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: In what sense would they appreciate it?</p><p>AREU: Well, if they truly appreciate the language and the culture and understand Feliz Navidad is Merry Christmas, yes, that's fine.</p><p>CARLSON: So, if they only know two words of Spanish, Feliz and Navidad--</p><p>AREU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's enough not to be a cultural appropriator?</p><p>AREU: Right, right, yes. Appropriation, it -- it's a fine line. Look, but (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Rudolph, I got to ask you the last question, and this is dead serious.</p><p>AREU: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that Rudolph, the Red-Nose Reindeer is a victim of bullying?</p><p>AREU: Yes. That's the whole tale. He is a victim of bullying.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>AREU: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is it -- would you say so corrosive because Rudolph accepts his bullying, he doesn't fight back--</p><p>AREU: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --that you would keep it from your kids?</p><p>AREU: You would have to talk it over and explain it with the kids. The kids nowadays understand anti-bullying much more than kids when that was first created.</p><p>CARLSON: But when it comes on, do you sit your kids down and say, look, Rudolph's about to be bullied.</p><p>AREU: A responsible parent--</p><p>CARLSON: He seems complicit in his own--</p><p>AREU: --would.</p><p>CARLSON: --but right is but (ph) right. There's a little--</p><p>AREU: A responsible parent would.</p><p>CARLSON: --Stockholm syndrome, going on now. He doesn't even know he's bullied.</p><p>AREU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: He's leading the sleigh anyway.</p><p>AREU: As, yes, as you -- as you would. You would sit down with the child to explain any bullying story. So, yes, Rudolph now needs an explanation.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that detracts them from (ph) the childlike joy of Christmas when you explain--</p><p>AREU: Absolutely not. No--</p><p>CARLSON: --to your kids that Rudolph--</p><p>AREU: --it's a little scary, I think, for this generation to see that Rudolph is being bullied. So, with this 2018 generation, you would have to explain why he's being bullied for having a red nose.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it a little weird that the generation that's afraid of everything and so easily intimidated spend so much time playing war video games, and looking at pornography? I mean on -- so, on the one hand they seem very kind of hardened--</p><p>AREU: I would say--</p><p>CARLSON: --and the other hand, they seem incredibly sensitive.</p><p>AREU: --I -- I can't imagine that they're doing those things.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I think they might be.</p><p>AREU: I don't think so.</p><p>CARLSON: Cathy Areu, great to see you--</p><p>AREU: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: --as always.</p><p>Allie Beth Stuckey is the host of a very popular podcast. She joins us tonight to respond to all this. Does Christmas seem as fun as it used to?</p><p>ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, RELATABLE PODCAST HOST, CRTV: No, it doesn't. And I was just thinking as you guys were talking, how in the world did I survive my childhood years without my parents sitting me down and talking to me about Rudolph, the Red-Nose Reindeer?</p><p>I don't know how any of us survived without all of these Liberal Sherpas and these woke (ph) warriors telling us how we should be offended, and how we're actually oppressed by Christmas movies, I just had no idea.</p><p>CARLSON: I wonder why the rest of us play along with this. We're kind of complicit in the destruction of the culture that we grew up in, when we take it seriously, just so in (ph) HuffPo, which is, obviously, a ludicrous website.</p><p>But I wonder when they run a piece like this, if the rest of us pay any attention at all, and I'm guilty of this as well, if we're not sort of giving it weight and legitimacy. And, maybe, the best is just to totally ignore it, and celebrate Christmas as we always have, and pretend that these people, these deeply unhappy people, mad at their parents, don't exist.</p><p>STUCKEY: I don't know. I think it's good to kind of shake them out of their echo chambers a little bit and just to remind them that everything you're saying is absolutely absurd. This has become kind of like a sardonic sport, I think, on the Left.</p><p>It's almost a competition to see who can say the most absurd, the most progressive thing about things that have otherwise been innocuous for -- for decades. So, I do think it's important that Conservatives at least weigh in a little bit and say, \"OK, let's talk about this factually.\"</p><p>CARLSON: You don't think that that I mean that they're kind of trolling us in the end? I mean they -- they're -- they're--</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, I -- no, I know (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --trying. I mean I sometimes feel like maybe it's too easy to get a rise out of me, and it's better just to laugh at them--</p><p>STUCKEY: No, I think--</p><p>CARLSON: --and say, you know, go back to your -- your sad dystopia in Brooklyn and argue amongst yourselves--</p><p>STUCKEY: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --that I'm not participating in this.</p><p>STUCKEY: Yes. I see what you're saying, but I don't know. I don't know. I think that we do need to weigh in on these conversations because if we let them slide, they do -- they do slip into the mainstream.</p><p>I wish that they were trolling us. This is why it's so hard to parody the Left. It's why it's so hard to have satire of the Left because of the things they say sound like satire. And I do think that we need to call that out for fear that this will become normal.</p><p>CARLSON: Huh? Do you think that 10 years from now, people will be free to use the term, snowman?</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, no. It's already snowperson. Haven't you heard? It's--</p><p>CARLSON: Is it? Really?</p><p>STUCKEY: --gingerbread person. Yes, gingerbread person. Come on, Tucker. You're behind the woke (ph) times.</p><p>CARLSON: My Producer just said in my ear, snowfolk.

I'll have to--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STUCKEY: --work on that one.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not playing along. The mailman brings Christmas cards with snowmen on them.

Thank you very much.</p><p>STUCKEY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, we've always had a place in our heart and in the lineup of this show for the weird and unexplained, and nothing is changing tonight.</p><p>We bring you news of a newly found skeleton that washed up from the sea that raises the question, \"What is under the water? What is this thing?\" It is science. And we'll bring you the cutting edge, after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(UFO FLYING SOUND)</p><p>TEXT: THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a photograph of a skeleton posted recently online has a lot of people asking, what is going on in the depths of the sea.</p><p>During a weekend walk on the beach, a New Zealand woman discovered a winged skeleton with spiked skin and a mouth that resembles a creature from the movie, Alien, there it is, the one that eats your guts and then explodes through your chest.</p><p>Fear not though. A Marine Ecologist says that the skeleton is not from outer space. It's something called a New Zealand rough skate. It lives mostly about 700 feet below the surface. And, of course, now, it will reside forever in your nightmares. That's our gift to you going into this weekend, which we hope you enjoy intensely.</p><p>We'll be back Monday night at 8:00, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018113001cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVV-X1J1-DXH2-62YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 30, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A  lot going on, as always. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A new investigation of Google uncovers how employees of the sinister tech  monopoly once again discussed ways to censor your political views without  your knowledge. Nobody in Congress seems to think this as a problem. These  new details might change their minds, fingers crossed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Plus, yesterday, we told you how Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer has made  the banned list for bullying, and other imaginary moral crimes. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now, the Victorians have another target, the salacious Christmas song,  Baby, It's Cold Outside. It turns out some of the lyrics in that tune are  naughty, and you should not be allowed to hear them. The Liberal Sherpa  joins us later to explain why.</p><p> But first tonight, it's been 752 days since the 2016 election. And for what  seems like the 752nd day in a row, the lead story in every news outlet in  this country is Russia. </p><p> Yes, Russia, a remote country in Central Asia with a median life expectancy  lower than that of Honduras. A place with an economy about the size of that  of the State of Texas, a vodka-soaked icescape (ph), whose shuffling  workforce can't seem to build a reliable airplane, that's Russia.</p><p> But nevertheless, it's a place that somehow, against all odds, manages to  dictate election outcomes on the other side of the world, using a crack  team of Secret Agents, so stealthy, we still don't know their names after  more than two years of investigating it. Russia.</p><p> According to cable news, Russia is the most important country in the world.  Today's installment of the Russia saga has something to do with Michael  Cohen and a potential real estate deal in Moscow. Now, the deal never  actually happened, not that would have made any difference, had it  happened. Foreign investment is still legal, even in Russia, but whatever.</p><p> This is a huge, huge deal, the hugest deal. It changes everything forever.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> RON INSANA, SENIOR ANALYST &amp; COMMENTATOR, CNBC: This President may not  serve out his term that -- that Bob Mueller may have enough that there's  both intense legal and intense political jeopardy for the President of the  United States.</p><p> JEFFREY ROSS TOOBIN, LEGAL ANALYST, CNN AND THE NEW YORKER: You know,  today's the first day I actually thought Donald Trump might not finish his  term in office.</p><p> ANDERSON HAYS COOPER, AUTHOR, PRIMARY ANCHOR, ANDERSON COOPER 360 , CNN:  Really?</p><p> TOOBIN: I mean I think this thing is enormous.</p><p> JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: Today is a good day for Donald Trump to  resign. I really believe that.</p><p> (CROWD CHEERING)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: This thing is enormous. He's resigning. So, once again, the  Administration is doomed because of Russia. We'll see.</p><p> What's remarkable though is that for the past couple of years, as the  geniuses on cable television has -- have been sounding the relentless alarm  about our mortal foe, Vladimir Putin, an actual threat to America has been  rising in the East.</p><p> If you're looking for a country to fret about, forget about Russia. The  Russians may pose a threat to Montenegro and Ukraine, but Phoenix and  Buffalo remain safe. The real danger to this country is China, and  everybody in power knows that.</p><p> The FBI Director, Christopher Wray, describes China as by far the biggest  espionage threat we face. Federal officials estimate there are thousands of  Chinese nationals in America right now, acting as spies, working to steal  sensitive U.S. technologies.</p><p> Some of these work for the Chinese military, which, by the way, is growing  at a much faster rate than our military or, for that matter, Russia's.  Meanwhile, China is literally poisoning the American population. </p><p> Synthetic opioids are the main driver of the drug epidemic that has killed  more than 70,000 Americans in just the last year. China is the biggest  source of these drugs. The Chinese government has done virtually nothing to  stop the flow of them. Why would they? This is war, and they're winning.</p><p> Now, you might think our media would have noticed all of this and maybe  written a story or two about it. But, no. Many of them, it turns out, are  on the Chinese payroll too. </p><p>Vox.com recently published a nauseatingly sycophantic piece written by a  reporter who had just traveled to China, it turns out, on the Chinese  government's dime. </p><p> Over at Jeff Bezos' Washington Post, you'll periodically see an entire  insert called China Watch. It looks like a news section. It reads like the  rest of the paper. </p><p> In fact, it's literally a product of Chinese state media. They paid to  place it, just as they paid and influenced numerous think tanks around  Washington, as well as many colleges and universities throughout the  country. It's a huge propaganda push that is almost never noted by anybody,  and it costs a lot. But over time, it's worth it. </p><p> The Chinese get what they pay for, a compliant American establishment that  uses fake threats, manufactured threats from Russia to obscure real and  imminent threats from China. Turns out, there really are traitors in  Washington, but they're not working for the Kremlin.</p><p> Julian Epstein is a former Chief Counsel for Democrats on the House  Judiciary Committee, and he joins us tonight. So, Julian, you and I both  live in Washington, and we know personally a lot of people who are in  effect on the Chinese payroll.</p><p> Madeleine Albright has made a lot of money from China. John Boehner, the  former Republican Speaker, works for a firm that lobbies for China. Jim  Wolfensohn, who ran the World Bank, advises the Chinese Sovereign Wealth  Fund, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p><p> How many people do you know who are openly working for Russia in  Washington?</p><p> JULIAN EPSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER CHIEF DEMOCRATIC COUNSEL TO  HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I think your basic point that the Chinese are a  greater long-term threat to us than Russia is, I think, that's true. I  think in the 1970s, China had about 1 percent of the flows of world trade.  They now have about 25 percent.</p><p> CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: They have about 2 percent of the global economy. And within the  decade, they will be equal to the size of the U.S. economy. By 2050, they  will be twice the size of the U.S. economy. </p><p> I think we thought, when we brought them into the World Trade Organization  in -- in 2001, that it would help them play fair. And I think what we've  seen since then is that they've cheated. They've stolen intellectual  property. </p><p> Up until 2014, they were certainly manipulating the currency. I don't think  they play by the rules. And I think one of the things I agree with the  President on is to get tough with China. I would approach it differently  than he does. But I think he's right to get tough on China.</p><p> I think the media ought to focus more on it. It's not as sensational, so  it's not going to get good ratings on cable television, but it's a real  problem. The disappearing middle class and working class is a real problem. </p><p> It's not sensational. It's not going to be a sugar-high for cable  television, so you -- I don't think you're going to have any of the  networks, not this network, not CNN, not MSNBC, any of them focusing on  those issues because you just don't get the sugar-high from that.</p><p> That's not to say Russia isn't a threat. I mean Russia has done lots of  things. All of our intelligence agencies and Republican and Democratic  Administrations have agreed--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --that even though they're 1 percent in the world economy, they  still do lots of things that are directly oppositional to us, and that are  trying to destabilize our interests--</p><p> CARLSON: Sure.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --whether it's in the Middle East, whether it's in Syria,  whether it's in the Balkans, whether it's in the U.K. It doesn't mean that  they're not a real threat, and there's not something to take seriously. </p><p> But I think your basic point is correct, which is that we are sleeping  while Rome burns with respect to China, and we have not taken seriously the  fact that they don't play by the rules. We have, you know--</p><p> CARLSON: Wait, so I'm -- I'm waiting to jump in with a hostile question,  but you're making my case for me. You've taken--</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: I -- well I -- I agree--</p><p> CARLSON: --all of my questions and reformatted them into--</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --I agree with--</p><p> CARLSON: --statements because I think you're absolutely right. So -- so, I  guess--</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --I agree with the metathesis. I agree with--</p><p> CARLSON: --well OK. Because I think--</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --the metathesis.</p><p> CARLSON: --it's hard to -- and thank you for being honest about that. And I  -- by the way, it's not a partisan thing. There are a ton of Republicans  working on behalf of China, I'm embarrassed to say.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: And Democrats are finally waking up, I think, that there is a  real threat that China does not play by the rules, and that it's something  to take very seriously. Again--</p><p> CARLSON: So, so, so but I wonder though--</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --I would approach it differently than the President. But--</p><p> CARLSON: --but--</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --I think he's right to say this is a real problem.</p><p> CARLSON: --but there's all this moral outrage about Russia and Saudi  Arabia, neither of which I've ever been in favor of, by the way. I'm not  carrying water for either one. But the idea that a country we are allied  with assassinates one of its political opponents, yes, it's bad. </p><p> But, I mean, that is a practically (ph) daily occurrence in China, and no  one says anything about it. And I just wonder, should we treat the people  in Washington, who have a lot of power, who are getting rich from China,  should we treat them as traitors in the same way that we treat anyone who  deals with Russia as a traitor?</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: I -- look, I think your point about even-handedness is well- taken. I think the Chinese do horrible things to journalists and to  dissidents and they -- and they get a pass on it. </p><p> I think, in a lot of cases, the social media giants, Facebook and Google,  enable a lot of the bad behavior that's going on in a lot of autocratic  regimes. We don't hear that much about it although that's starting to get  covered.</p><p> I think if your point is proportionality, it -- does the news, and  particularly cable news, does it cover these things in the proper  proportionality? I agree with that meta-point that you're making. </p><p> It doesn't mean to say that when the Saudis go and kill an American  journalist, we shouldn't be getting tough on the Saudis. It doesn't mean to  say if the Russians create a military intelligence attack on the United  States that that's not something we shouldn't--</p><p> CARLSON: No, and I'm not arguing that.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --take seriously and we shouldn't -- and we should get to the  bottom of that. But I think your basic point is that, you know, there is  selective outrage. There is a lot of chest-thumping. </p><p> There is a lot of kind of, you know, morally superior indignation that --  that occurs on the Russia issue. And, you know, I -- you and I may have  slightly different views on the Russian issue--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm trying to argue with you, Julian Epstein--</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --but--</p><p> CARLSON: --but it's -- it's proving absolutely impossible.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --but -- but--</p><p> CARLSON: You did a better job than I could have--</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --but, you know--</p><p> CARLSON: --in making that case.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --there -- there's lot of self-righteousness--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, tell me about it.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --on certain issues. And I -- I think there's reason to be  upset about what happened with Russia. There's reason to be upset with  Saudi Arabia. But I think if you're going to be outraged on those issues,  your point is correct that you should be equally outraged--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --on the abuses--</p><p> CARLSON: All right (ph). And -- and that's it-- </p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --that are occurring--</p><p> CARLSON: --right there.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: --in China. And the accusers (ph) in -- in China are very, very  serious, and you're exactly right about that.</p><p> CARLSON: Julian Epstein, thank you very much.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: OK. Thanks.</p><p> CARLSON: Unexpected. Appreciate it.</p><p> J. EPSTEIN: Good to see you, Tucker. OK.</p><p> CARLSON: Gordon Chang has been thinking about these questions for a very  long time. He's the Author of The Coming Collapse of China, and he joins  us. So, Gordon, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p> Put this into perspective, if you would. To what extent, do you think, the  Chinese government influences American policy?</p><p> GORDON GUTHRIE CHANG, COLUMNIST, BLOGGER, TELEVISION PUNDIT, LAWYER, THE  COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA AUTHOR: Oh, certainly across the board. We saw it  during this midterm elections, the Chinese tried to influence outcomes. </p><p> And they did it with not only that famous Des Moines Register's four-page  insert. But they also summoned the heads of Wall Street firms to Beijing  for that September 16th meeting. You go on and on about the types of things  that they've been doing.</p><p> CARLSON: Let -- let me -- let me -- let me pause there for our viewers who  don't know what you're referring to. September 16th, they, as you put it,  summoned the Heads of Wall Street firms to Beijing to do what?</p><p> CHANG: To talk about the midterm elections, to talk about tariffs, to talk  about the trade relationship because Beijing was very, very concerned about  what the Trump Administration is doing to impose costs on China, because it  is causing problems in the Chinese economy, which is under stress.</p><p> So, they said, \"Look, we're holding this meeting. We want you there.\" And a  lot of people from Wall Street actually took the flight to Beijing.</p><p> CARLSON: American citizens--</p><p> CHANG: American citizens.</p><p> CARLSON: --summoned by the Communist Chinese government actually went?</p><p> CHANG: They actually went and they held that meeting. And, you know, this  shows the power of Beijing, and it shows that they were trying to change  the results in the election. </p><p> Now, I don't think that it would -- had any real effect. And the reason is,  as Julian and you have talked about, across the American political spectrum  right now, people are starting to understand the fundamental nature of the  challenge that China poses to us. </p><p> And it's certainly much greater challenge than Russia, because Russia  couldn't challenge the U.S., if it weren't for being backstopped by the  Chinese.</p><p> CARLSON: Right. So, I mean you've got to think of Russia as sort of a -- a  drunk troublemaker that can kind of, you know, make some prank calls. But  in the end, China's economy is about to become, as Julian just noted  correctly, larger than ours. So, like, why aren't we completely freaked out  about our future about this (ph)?</p><p> CHANG: Well we should be because the Chinese are taking hundreds of  billions of dollars of U.S. intellectual property each year by theft or by  force transfer. And -- and that is the lifeblood of our economy because we  have an innovation-based economy. </p><p> And if we can't commercialize our technology, we don't have an economy. We  end up just selling agricultural products to the world and maybe scrap  metal. </p><p> The point is though we need to have the technological giants that will  dominate the future of the world's economy. They should be American. And  China, by means which are certainly not fair, is trying to do that.</p><p> And one other thing, Tucker, you mentioned Fentanyl and opioid crisis. You  know, the Chinese government runs a police state. They know about these  Chinese gangs that are selling Fentanyl into the U.S.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> CHANG: And so, those gangs couldn't operate unless they had Beijing's  approval. Now, officials on China are making money from it and, in other  cases, the Chinese officials are just standing back. But they purposely  want to see Americans die. And we can't forget that.</p><p> CARLSON: Tens of thousands of Americans do die every year because of  synthetic opioids manufactured in China. And yet, I can't remember the last  time I heard someone in our political class say that out loud. Why?</p><p> CHANG: Well I -- I think that is because there's -- there's a lot of  reasons. </p><p> Part of it is because a lot of people are actually getting money from  China. A number of reasons for other people is that they sort of believe  that we should be engaging the Chinese, you know, this is the Nixon policy  of trying to work with Beijing, so that it's not on the outside of the  international system.</p><p> And that sounds nice but it hasn't worked over four decades. We've tried  all sorts of things, and -- and it hasn't worked. We've tried negotiation,  engagement. We did all those things. And, unfortunately, the Chinese  behavior in the economy and in other things has just gotten worse.</p><p> CARLSON: Gordon Chang, thank you very much for that.</p><p> CHANG: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p> Well employees at Google just got caught, once again, plotting to suppress  political views they don't like. We have details on that, after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> CARLSON: More evidence that the sinister tech monopoly, Google, is not on  the level, not at all what it claims to be. New leaked communications from  inside that company show that Google employees discussed suppressing  Conservative news websites in their search engine right after the 2016  election.</p><p> In one post from November 9th, 2016, a Google Engineer, called Scott Byer,  called The Daily Caller and Breitbart, \"opinion blogs,\" and said that  Google employees should reduce the visibility of both sites in search  results compared to, \"Legitimate news organizations.\" Other employees said  it was the company's job to provide more \"Context\" to rebut news outlets  they dislike.</p><p> Robert Epstein is a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute  for Behavioral Research and Technology, and one of the people who's paid  closest attention to the power that Google has. Mr. Epstein, thanks very  much for coming on tonight.</p><p> So, Google has said repeatedly that it does not manipulate search results.  And yet, this is not the first, not even close to the first piece of  evidence we have from within the company showing Google employees  discussing ways to manipulate search results. Can we be confident they're  not doing it?</p><p> ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: Not at  all. You know, Google is extremely good at keeping its secrets for almost  20 years. But, in the last few months, that has changed, and there have  been quite a number of leaks. </p><p> And we have seen a number of internal discussions there like the one that  you just described. And there's simply no question that they have very  strong political leanings. 95 percent of donations there go to Democrats. </p><p> I myself am not a Conservative. I actually--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> R. EPSTEIN: --I -- I -- I kind of lean toward Google's political views. But  it's -- it's frightening to me because of what I study day by day. It's  frightening to me that this company, with very strong political leanings,  has the power to shift millions of votes, to shift opinions on a massive  scale without people knowing that they're doing it and without being  accountable to the public.</p><p> CARLSON: How can you have a democracy under those circumstances where one  privately-held company has the power to manipulate people's behavior  without people knowing it?</p><p> R. EPSTEIN: Well that's what I'm saying. And that's exactly what's  happening here, and the situation gets even worse when -- when these huge  tech companies, the two largest being Google and Facebook, when they both  have the same political leanings.</p><p> So, you know, in that kind of scenario, we're talking about the ability to  shift in the midterm elections, I calculated, upwards of 12 million votes  with no one having any idea that they're doing this. This is not like fake  ads where -- which you can see.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> R. EPSTEIN: This is invisible manipulation. I -- I literally have to invent  new names for the techniques they're using because they've never existed  before.</p><p> CARLSON: So, Google assures us that they're not doing this because they're  good people, much better people than we are, for example. How can we know  if they're telling the truth? And should we believe them?</p><p> R. EPSTEIN: Oh well, they're -- they're sure they're good people. That's  part of the problem. They have a kind of Utopian thinking within the  company, not just among the employees but, you know, their top executives  think like Utopians.</p><p> So, there -- there -- believe me, they believe that they are doing good for  humanity, good for -- good for the United States by imposing their values,  their thinking on the rest of us. The problem is, as I say, that they can  do it in ways that have never existed before in human history.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I know that -- as you already said, you and I have different  political views, probably don't vote for the same people, so you're maybe  the person to ask. </p><p> How can the United States Congress sit back with evidence that democracy,  the core idea of democracy, is being challenged by this company, and not do  anything about it?</p><p> R. EPSTEIN: Well, the Democrats aren't going to do anything because these  companies help them, obviously. The Republicans don't like regulations. So,  we have a tough problem here in the U.S.</p><p> Now, the Europeans, on the other hand, you know, they -- they see these  companies as American, and so, there have been -- they've been much tougher  on them. </p><p> And I think we're going to see -- we're going to see some pretty drastic  actions taken against these companies by the EU in the next few years. And  that could change their ability to operate worldwide.</p><p> CARLSON: I never thought I'd be waiting for France and Germany to come to  our rescue but that's -- that's where we are, unfortunately. Mr. Epstein,  thank you very much. It was great, as always.</p><p> R. EPSTEIN: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Harmeet Dhillon is an attorney who has frequently, at cost to  herself, stood up to big tech, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS  ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE  FOR  CALIFORNIA: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --coming on tonight. </p><p> So, this, again, as I just heard (ph) Mr. Epstein, yet another example of  evidence from within this company, and there are other examples like it  from Facebook, that show that they're not on the level, that they're lying  to us, and that they could undermine the very basis of our democracy. </p><p> Let me ask you the same question. Why is Congress standing by in the face  of this evidence and doing nothing?</p><p>DHILLON: Let me add to that, why is the Department of Justice not opening  up anti-trust investigations?</p><p> CARLSON: Well, exactly.</p><p>DHILLON: Why is the Federal Trade Commission not investigating them for  their deceptive trade practices and failure to disclose their manipulation  of data and theft of data from Americans and others? </p><p> So, today itself, the European Union opened up a new, its fourth in the  last two years' investigation into Google for anti-trust issues for  manipulating search. Guess what? And so far, they've been fined $7.1  billion in Europe in the last 17 months, but zippo here in the United  States on the same issues.</p><p> And one of the reasons, Tucker, is that these companies, both of them are  very adept at spreading money around Capitol Hill, including through the  use of a former Republican Congresswoman, Susan Molinari, and those are  their lobbyists, and they're very effective.</p><p> That's why you see legislators backing off for the most part. But we are  talking about fascistic, you know, control of our data in a way that is  perceived as benevolent by -- certainly by Liberals and is not being  criticized at all by the Right. I think it's a very dangerous situation.</p><p> CARLSON: So, but what's the point? I mean, just as (ph) a macro question,  what's the point of having a government, of sending half your income every  year to Washington, if they won't protect you from the most basic and  obvious threat to our entire system, which is these companies? Why do we  have a government if they won't stand up to Google and Facebook?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, interestingly, I think we're going to see some action on the  part of these companies, against these companies, I should say, in the new  Congress because Liberals are concerned about the data theft much more so  than Conservatives are. </p><p> But we're still not going to see anything about this bias in terms of  viewpoint. In addition to what you've covered on your segment tonight so  far, obviously, there's suppression of -- of YouTube videos on an  ideological basis. </p><p>Google also discourages its advertisers from advertising on Conservative  platforms like Breitbart and others. Google's search engine has labeled the  California Republican Party as having Nazi ideology and Republican Women as  -- as being enablers. </p><p> It is the most despicable, defamatory work, and it is all protected by the  Communications Decency Act, which members of Congress certainly could edit  and change, but they don't. And so, I'm very disappointed in our  government, our Conservative government, frankly, and Washington on its  failure to act on these issues.</p><p> CARLSON: So, as you just pointed out, very quickly, these companies operate  in the way that they do very profitably because they have a special  exemption from the Congress, which could revoke that exemption because  they're not platforms. They're media companies. Of course, they're editing.</p><p> Can -- name just, if you would, since we're live now, three or four Members  of Congress who, you know, might lead the charge against this?</p><p> DHILLON: Well, actually I guess, I don't think any Members of Congress  currently have identified themselves as being hostile to this. But, you  know, Jim Jordan certainly seems to be somebody who's familiar with these  issues. Matt Gaetz is another. </p><p> I think these guys are sensitive to these issues. But -- and I don't think  they're beholden to big tech. You know, maybe they haven't been there long  enough to have that sink in yet.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> DHILLON: But -- but we have -- we have had Senators, Mike Lee, for example,  has looked at the anti-trust situation, and then backed off. I'd like to  see our Senate newly constituted with more votes take a hard look at this,  have some hearings, really put them on the spot.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> DHILLON: Sundar Pichai is going to be testifying in Congress next week. I  have suggested that definitely some hard questions need to be asked. And I  know that there are certainly -- there's an intention to ask some hard  questions next week so--</p><p> CARLSON: I hope that happens.</p><p> DHILLON: --we'll see what happens.</p><p> CARLSON: Hope they get moving. Harmeet Dhillon, you've been brave on this  question. We're -- we're grateful for it. Thank you.</p><p> DHILLON: My pleasure, thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, a man who says he was trying to blow the whistle on the  Uranium One deal, remember that, says the FBI repaid him by raiding his  house. That story's after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, here's an interesting story you may not have seen. FBI  agents raided the home of a Uranium One whistleblower. That's according to  a new report by The Daily Caller News Foundation. </p><p> A man called Dennis Nathan Cain has turned over documents to the DoJ as  well as to the both House and Senate Intel committees. The documents  allegedly show that federal officials failed to investigate possible  criminal activity involving the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One  deal. </p><p> Now, Cain says, the FBI repaid him by sending 16 agents to raid his house  for six hours.</p><p> Dan Bongino is a former Secret Service Agent, NRATV contributor, and Author  of Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump. He joins us tonight.  Dan, thanks a lot for coming on. So, this is a remarkable--</p><p> DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  FORMER NYPD OFFICER, NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Sure.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is one of those stories I personally don't want to believe  could be true that we live in a country where the FBI is used to carry out  political grudges. How do you assess this?</p><p> BONGINO: Well, Tucker, I don't want to believe that, either. Having been a  former Federal Agent myself, this is deeply disturbing. But there's --  there's a -- there's -- is a bifurcated way to look at this right now. And  I'll just -- I'll just sum it up like this.  This is either really, really bad for the Clintons or really, really bad  for the FBI, meaning this. You don't typically raid a whistleblower's  house. The whole idea of being a whistleblower is you're providing  information voluntarily to assist law enforcement or the government. </p><p> Why you would raid the house is puzzling to a lot of people? Some people  believe that this could be really bad for the Clintons and be kind of a  tying up of the Clinton Foundation case that appears to be being  investigated by John Huber right now, the United States attorney.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> BONGINO: On the other hand, Tucker, listen, the people involved in this  Uranium One case, the Rosatom and the 10x (ph) case are all people who are  knee-deep in the Spygate saga. That -- that's just a fact. That's not a  conspiracy theory. It's just true.</p><p> Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, was the prosecuting United  States Attorney on the precursor case to Uranium One, that disaster, Bob  Mueller was the FBI Director. </p><p> So, forgive me for not being willing to give everybody a pass on a  suspicious raid on a whistleblower's pass. It's just a matter of fact. I --  I guess I should say it this way. I'm not taking anybody at their word any  more, and neither should you, either. We should ask questions on this.</p><p> CARLSON: But what's so surprising is who's not asking questions about this.  So, for generations, the Left elevated the idea of whistleblowing to -- to  -- to a sanctified place. Whistleblowers were protected. They are protected  in law, and they're protected because Liberals wanted them protected. </p><p> And yet, I haven't heard anybody in the Left complain about the FBI raid on  this guy's house. Why is that?</p><p> BONGINO: Tucker, listen, the -- the -- the rage at -- at Donald Trump has - - has this -- you have brought this up on your show so many times, it can't  be highlighted enough. </p><p> The Left, which previously aligned with groups like the American Civil  Liberties Union that was actually interested, at one point, no more,  apparently, in defending civil liberties has--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> BONGINO: --completely abandoned that now. They have now flipped the script  entirely to actually defending weaponized government.</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> BONGINO: It is unbelievable the transformation we've seen. There's --  listen, it's not in dispute that there are serious abnormalities in the way  the Donald Trump investigation was conducted, the Trump team investigation,  and the way the Clinton investigation and the Uranium One investigations  were sidelined.</p><p> But nobody's even remotely curious on the Left about this. It's really  incredible, because, Tucker, as you know with government, some day it turns  on you too. Government--</p><p> CARLSON: It's exactly right.</p><p> BONGINO: --doesn't respect party. It's all about power.</p><p> CARLSON: It's unwise. Very unwise.</p><p> Dan Bongino, thank you, as always, have a great weekend.</p><p> BONGINO: Thanks, Tucker. You too.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, as you well know, dozens of U.S. cities have decided they're  not going to enforce federal immigration law because they don't feel like  it. And that's OK with the Left.</p><p> Now, one Police Chief is looking to apply the very same standard to gun  control laws. How much support is he going to get? He joins us next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, Merry Christmas from General Motors. The car company just  announced plans to lay off 15,000 workers and shut down major factories in  the states of Michigan, Maryland, and Ohio.</p><p> Now, the cuts are coming despite the fact that General Motors has posted  nearly $3 billion in profit just last quarter. Workers at one soon-to-be- closed plant told The Wall Street Journal that they were quote, blindsided  by the decision. They didn't know it was coming.</p><p> One person who will not be struggling to pay for Christmas presents this  year is General Motors CEO, Mary Barra. She made nearly $22 million in the  last year. That makes her the industry's highest-paid CEO. Toyota's CEO, by  stark comparison, makes less than $4 million a year, even though he runs a  far more successful company. </p><p> Now, what has Mary Barra done to earn all that money? Well, as CEO, she's  laid off thousands of workers. She shut down plants and overseen the recall  of tens of millions of defective vehicles. </p><p> A few years ago, she was forced to testify to Congress about faulty  ignition switches that killed more than a hundred drivers. In modern  corporate America, that is considered a deeply successful record. Give that  woman a raise. Of course, if GM is serious about cutting cost, there is one  obvious solution, fire Mary Barra.</p><p> Well, for years, Liberal cities and states have been claiming the right to  ignore federal immigration law. Now, one small town Police Chief in  Washington State is saying the same principle can be applied to far- reaching gun laws.</p><p> A new gun control ordinance in Washington imposes stricter background  checks, raises the age for buying a semi-automatic rifle, and allows gun  owners to be criminally prosecuted if their firearms are stolen, and then  used illegally.</p><p> Loren Culp is the Police Chief of Republic, Washington, and says that he  wants his town to be a sanctuary from these new gun laws. Some local  residents oppose the new measure in Washington. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Opponents say it forces gun owners to secure them in a  way that could put them in danger.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm concerned that not being able to access my gun  when I need it.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're not going to tell the criminal, can you hold on a  moment because we have a law that I have to, you know, safe -- safely store  it in the garage somewhere and, you know, in a -- and so, can you hold on a  moment. I'm going to go take it. And I'm going to defend myself. Then,  we'll talk.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You call the police or -- or things go down, it's less  than one minute, so those seconds count.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Police Chief Loren Culp joins us tonight by Skype. Chief, thanks  very much for coming on. It's good to see you.</p><p> LOREN CULP, REPUBLIC, WASHINGTON, POLICE CHIEF: Good evening, Tucker,  thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON: So, is this, in effect, a -- a sanctuary, your town, Republic,  Washington, from the gun laws of your state?</p><p> CULP: I have suggested an ordinance and recommended it to the City Council.  And they're in the process of reviewing that, and doing their due  diligence, to see if they want to pass that. But as far as the Police  Department goes, we will not be enforcing that.</p><p> CARLSON: So, cities that have decided to ignore federal -- federal  immigration law have received the applause and support of almost everyone  on the American Left. What do you think the response will be if your town  passes this ordinance?</p><p> CULP: I don't think the same people would be very happy. The thing about it  is illegal immigrants aren't covered by the Bill of Rights in the  Constitution, and gun owners are.</p><p> CARLSON: A very good point. So what do -- what will happen next, do you  think? Will the Governor of the State try and force you to enforce the law  that you think is unconstitutional?</p><p> CULP: Well, I don't know how it could, Tucker, because we live in a  Constitutional Republic, contrary to what a lot of people tell us that we  live in a democracy. But we have the rule of law in this state and across  the United States. And the Constitution is the law of the land. </p><p> And everybody knows what the Second Amendment says. A lot of your viewers  might not know what the Washington State Constitution says about firearms.  But really quickly, it says the right of the individual citizen to bear  arms in defense of himself or the State shall not be impaired. </p><p> So, that's even more explicit than the Second Amendment. So, I -- I don't  know how they can get around that and try to force me to go against my Oath  of Office to uphold that.</p><p> CARLSON: Interesting. I had no idea your state's Constitution said that.  It's -- it sounds like it's being already ignored throughout the State of  Washington. So, very quickly, this State law would require gun owners to  keep their guns locked up at all times?</p><p> CULP: It requires you to keep it locked up because if someone gains access  to your gun, say, you're -- you're away from home and someone breaks into  your home and steals your gun, goes out and commits a crime with it, you  can be charged up to a felony for that person getting your gun and  committing a crime with it.</p><p> CARLSON: If someone--</p><p> CULP: Absolutely ridiculous.</p><p> CARLSON: --if someone steals--</p><p> CULP: It's like charging--</p><p> CARLSON: --your car--</p><p> CULP: --charging someone who has her car stolen and the person drives off  and goes through a crowd of people.</p><p> CARLSON: Huh.</p><p> CULP: It -- it's ridiculous.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, that is ridiculous. And good for you for fighting back  against it. Chief Culp, thank you very much for coming on and explaining  that. Appreciate it.</p><p> CULP: Tucker, I have a real quick message for you, though.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> CULP: Ted Nugent (ph) told me to tell you hi.</p><p> CARLSON: Always a welcome message especially on a Friday. Thank you. Thank  you, Chief. Good to see you.</p><p> CULP: Good night, thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, there's no war on Christmas. That's like some Right-wing  trope that only dumb people believe. Meanwhile, the war on Christmas  continues apace. Yesterday, it was Rudolph. Today, it's something else and  we'll tell you what it is. Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: THE LIBERAL SHERPA.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, the forces of darkness rung in the holiday season with an  attack on Rudolph, the Red-Nose Reindeer. That was at HuffPo. But those  attacks have expanded to a more familiar line of attack, the classic  holiday song, Baby, It's Cold Outside. </p><p> Cleveland Radio Station, WDOK, has dropped that song from its Christmas  lineup after a listener called in to complain that it was inappropriate,  somehow, in the wake of the #MeToo movement. </p><p> How about fat-shaming songs about Santa Claus? Will be -- they be the next  to go? Here to explain it, The Liberal Sherpa, Catalina Magazine Founder,  Cathy Areu.</p><p> Cathy Areu, great to see you tonight.</p><p> CATHERINE AREU, FOUNDING PUBLISHER, CATALINA MAGAZINE: Good to see you.</p><p> CARLSON: It does seem like a lot of the songs about Santa make reference to  his weight in a way that is not very sensitive.</p><p> AREU: I don't think he minds. I mean, he's jolly, right?</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> AREU: He's a jolly guy.</p><p> CARLSON: Baby, It's Cold Outside. Is that song (ph)--</p><p> AREU: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --we need to give up because of #MeToo?</p><p> AREU: Not because of #MeToo. I -- I looked at it and it seems like a few  years back, people were commenting that the lyrics--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> AREU: --if you read those lyrics, it's not a holiday song.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> AREU: It doesn't say holidays, happy holidays, Christmas, anything. It's  just cold outside. And an older man is telling a younger woman not to go  home to her parents, to stay around, have another drink. And she says,  \"What's in this drink?\"</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> AREU: He says, \"Don't worry about it.\" She said, \"I feel kind of funny.\"</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> AREU: \"Let's stick around.\" So, if you read it--</p><p> CARLSON: She's getting roofied.</p><p> AREU: --yes, apparently, he slipped something in the drink, and she stays  the night.</p><p> CARLSON: Do we get to a point where human worth, warmth, and romance, are  illegal?</p><p> AREU: That's not romance. This is a guy slipping her something and she's  spending the night, and she doesn't know what happened.</p><p> CARLSON: And yet, for 50 years, she never complained about it. I guess she  never knew how perfect (ph) she was.</p><p> AREU: She did. She said, \"I'm trying to say no, no, no.\" The song explains  it. She's saying, \"No,\" in the song.</p><p> CARLSON: When--</p><p> AREU: No means no, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --when Mommy kisses Santa Claus--</p><p> AREU: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --has consent been given?</p><p> AREU: When Mommy kisses Santa? I -- I -- it sounds like Mommy was OK with  that. She didn't--</p><p> CARLSON: Really? This fat guy--</p><p> AREU: --say no, no, no.</p><p> CARLSON: --comes down your chimney, shows up in your living room and kisses  Mommy, and that's voluntary, you're saying.</p><p> AREU: I mean the cheek. Wasn't it on the--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, no, I don't -- I don't. But -- no, I don't--</p><p> AREU: --cheek.</p><p> CARLSON: --think so.</p><p> AREU: Oh, OK, because it's not--</p><p> CARLSON: Would Frosty, the Snowperson--</p><p> AREU: --specified there (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --be a more inclusive title, do you think?</p><p> AREU: I think so, yes. Man, you know, that's--</p><p> CARLSON: Does the phrase White Christmas--</p><p> AREU: --inappropriate, I mean. </p><p> CARLSON: --strike you as racist?</p><p> AREU: Snow is white, so it's appropriate.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> AREU: Yellow snow--</p><p> CARLSON: It doesn't seem problematic in the slightest?</p><p> AREU: I don't think so. I mean--</p><p> CARLSON: When White people sing Feliz Navidad, is that cultural  appropriation?</p><p> AREU: It depends, right? If they sing it with a sombrero, and they're  mocking at the culture then, perhaps, yes--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> AREU: --they've crossed the line.</p><p> CARLSON: But if they sing it just humming along--</p><p> AREU: And appreciating it. And appreciating the song--</p><p> CARLSON: --the sound track at Walmart, that's OK?</p><p> AREU: --if they appreciate it.</p><p> CARLSON: In what sense would they appreciate it?</p><p> AREU: Well, if they truly appreciate the language and the culture and  understand Feliz Navidad is Merry Christmas, yes, that's fine.</p><p> CARLSON: So, if they only know two words of Spanish, Feliz and Navidad--</p><p> AREU: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --that's enough not to be a cultural appropriator?</p><p> AREU: Right, right, yes. Appropriation, it -- it's a fine line. Look, but  (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Rudolph, I got to ask you the last question, and this is dead  serious.</p><p> AREU: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think that Rudolph, the Red-Nose Reindeer is a victim of  bullying?</p><p> AREU: Yes. That's the whole tale. He is a victim of bullying.</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> AREU: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: So, is it -- would you say so corrosive because Rudolph accepts  his bullying, he doesn't fight back--</p><p> AREU: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --that you would keep it from your kids?</p><p> AREU: You would have to talk it over and explain it with the kids. The kids  nowadays understand anti-bullying much more than kids when that was first  created.</p><p> CARLSON: But when it comes on, do you sit your kids down and say, look,  Rudolph's about to be bullied.</p><p> AREU: A responsible parent--</p><p> CARLSON: He seems complicit in his own--</p><p> AREU: --would.</p><p> CARLSON: --but right is but (ph) right. There's a little--</p><p> AREU: A responsible parent would.</p><p> CARLSON: --Stockholm syndrome, going on now. He doesn't even know he's  bullied.</p><p> AREU: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: He's leading the sleigh anyway.</p><p> AREU: As, yes, as you -- as you would. You would sit down with the child to  explain any bullying story. So, yes, Rudolph now needs an explanation.</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think that detracts them from (ph) the childlike joy of  Christmas when you explain--</p><p> AREU: Absolutely not. No--</p><p> CARLSON: --to your kids that Rudolph--</p><p> AREU: --it's a little scary, I think, for this generation to see that  Rudolph is being bullied. So, with this 2018 generation, you would have to  explain why he's being bullied for having a red nose.</p><p> CARLSON: Is it a little weird that the generation that's afraid of  everything and so easily intimidated spend so much time playing war video  games, and looking at pornography? I mean on -- so, on the one hand they  seem very kind of hardened--</p><p> AREU: I would say--</p><p> CARLSON: --and the other hand, they seem incredibly sensitive.</p><p> AREU: --I -- I can't imagine that they're doing those things.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I think they might be.</p><p> AREU: I don't think so.</p><p> CARLSON: Cathy Areu, great to see you--</p><p> AREU: Good to see you.</p><p> CARLSON: --as always.</p><p> Allie Beth Stuckey is the host of a very popular podcast. She joins us  tonight to respond to all this. Does Christmas seem as fun as it used to?</p><p> ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR,  RELATABLE PODCAST HOST, CRTV: No, it doesn't. And I was just thinking as  you guys were talking, how in the world did I survive my childhood years  without my parents sitting me down and talking to me about Rudolph, the  Red-Nose Reindeer? </p><p> I don't know how any of us survived without all of these Liberal Sherpas  and these woke (ph) warriors telling us how we should be offended, and how  we're actually oppressed by Christmas movies, I just had no idea.</p><p> CARLSON: I wonder why the rest of us play along with this. We're kind of  complicit in the destruction of the culture that we grew up in, when we  take it seriously, just so in (ph) HuffPo, which is, obviously, a ludicrous  website.</p><p> But I wonder when they run a piece like this, if the rest of us pay any  attention at all, and I'm guilty of this as well, if we're not sort of  giving it weight and legitimacy. And, maybe, the best is just to totally  ignore it, and celebrate Christmas as we always have, and pretend that  these people, these deeply unhappy people, mad at their parents, don't  exist.</p><p> STUCKEY: I don't know. I think it's good to kind of shake them out of their  echo chambers a little bit and just to remind them that everything you're  saying is absolutely absurd. This has become kind of like a sardonic sport,  I think, on the Left.</p><p> It's almost a competition to see who can say the most absurd, the most  progressive thing about things that have otherwise been innocuous for --  for decades. So, I do think it's important that Conservatives at least  weigh in a little bit and say, \"OK, let's talk about this factually.\"</p><p> CARLSON: You don't think that that I mean that they're kind of trolling us  in the end? I mean they -- they're -- they're--</p><p> STUCKEY: Oh, I -- no, I know (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --trying. I mean I sometimes feel like maybe it's too easy to get  a rise out of me, and it's better just to laugh at them--</p><p> STUCKEY: No, I think--</p><p> CARLSON: --and say, you know, go back to your -- your sad dystopia in  Brooklyn and argue amongst yourselves--</p><p> STUCKEY: --yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --that I'm not participating in this.</p><p> STUCKEY: Yes. I see what you're saying, but I don't know. I don't know. I  think that we do need to weigh in on these conversations because if we let  them slide, they do -- they do slip into the mainstream. </p><p> I wish that they were trolling us. This is why it's so hard to parody the  Left. It's why it's so hard to have satire of the Left because of the  things they say sound like satire. And I do think that we need to call that  out for fear that this will become normal.</p><p> CARLSON: Huh? Do you think that 10 years from now, people will be free to  use the term, snowman?</p><p> STUCKEY: Oh, no. It's already snowperson. Haven't you heard? It's--</p><p> CARLSON: Is it? Really?</p><p> STUCKEY: --gingerbread person. Yes, gingerbread person. Come on, Tucker.  You're behind the woke (ph) times.</p><p>CARLSON: My Producer just said in my ear, snowfolk. Have you heard of this?</p><p> STUCKEY: Snowfolk, I can't even say that. Snowfolk. Snowfolk, I can't say  it. I'll have to--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STUCKEY: --work on that one.</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not playing along. The mailman brings Christmas cards with  snowmen on them. That's the world that--</p><p> STUCKEY: Oh, man. You're going to get--</p><p> CARLSON: --I live in. And I'm not--</p><p> STUCKEY: --censored. You might get taken off air.</p><p> CARLSON: --changing. </p><p> Allie Beth Stuckey, great to see you tonight. Thank you very much.</p><p> STUCKEY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: All right, we've always had a place in our heart and in the lineup  of this show for the weird and unexplained, and nothing is changing  tonight.</p><p> We bring you news of a newly found skeleton that washed up from the sea  that raises the question, \"What is under the water? What is this thing?\" It  is science. And we'll bring you the cutting edge, after the break.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (UFO FLYING SOUND)</p><p> TEXT: THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> TEXT: THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, a photograph of a skeleton posted recently online has a lot  of people asking, what is going on in the depths of the sea. </p><p> During a weekend walk on the beach, a New Zealand woman discovered a winged  skeleton with spiked skin and a mouth that resembles a creature from the  movie, Alien, there it is, the one that eats your guts and then explodes  through your chest.</p><p> Fear not though. A Marine Ecologist says that the skeleton is not from  outer space. It's something called a New Zealand rough skate. It lives  mostly about 700 feet below the surface. And, of course, now, it will  reside forever in your nightmares. That's our gift to you going into this  weekend, which we hope you enjoy intensely. </p><p> We'll be back Monday night at 8:00, the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.
