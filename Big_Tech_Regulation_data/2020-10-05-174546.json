The world's largest social media company is under pressure to improve its handling of data after disclosing that information about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Facebook adjusted the privacy settings on its service on Wednesday, giving users control over their personal information in fewer taps. Facebook has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom Corp and Experian PLC . The tool has been widely used among certain categories of advertisers - such as automakers, luxury goods producers and consumer packaged goods companies - who do not sell directly to consumers and have relatively little information about who their customers are, according to Facebook. </p><p>\"While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook,\" Graham Mudd, a Facebook product marketing director, said in a statement. Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to US$25 after Facebook's announcement after the bell. Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged. A representative for Acxiom could not immediately be reached for comment. Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue. Advertisers would still be able to use third-party data services to measure how well their ads performed by examining purchasing data, Facebook said. Facebook's website lists nine third-party data providers that it has worked with, including Acxiom, Experian, Oracle Data Cloud , TransUnion and WPP PLC . None of the companies could immediately be reached for comment. Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said. Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users' anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation. Facebook's shares closed up 0.5 percent at US$153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook's lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation. SCRUTINY FROM LAWMAKERS Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers' access to user information. There is a new Facebook page - called Access Your Information - where users can see what they have shared and manage it. \"The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg's promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,\" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers. They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a \"right to portability\" - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law. Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users' data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica. He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators. Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook, and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened.

It requires companies to give people a \"right to portability\" - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 per cent of global revenue for companies breaking the law.</p><p>Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamouring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users' data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.</p><p> Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators.Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.</p><p> The US House Energy and Commerce Committee and US Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing.The US Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook, and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTAFR-EASTA29032018015334</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTAFR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0J-7DH1-F00C-620Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416410</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The East African All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East African</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002PXL</classCode><className>ACXIOM CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001OOM</classCode><className>EXPERIAN PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002N6S</classCode><className>WPP PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000DIID</classCode><className>TRANSUNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>XIM (FRA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ACXM (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>EXPN (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>WPPGY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>WPP (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>TRU (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has apologised, admitting the leaked data was a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d.  <br/>\u201cFacebook benefits from extremely strong network externality effects,\u201d noted Professor Savva. In other words, additional users have a positive impact on the value of the service to others: people use Facebook because their friends use it, too. \u201cThis networking effect creates a monopoly. Lack of competition reduces the firm\u2019s incentive to continually improve.\u201d  <br/>Facebook is in a unique situation because, unlike Google, it would take a mass exodus of users to bring the platform to its knees. \u201cThe moment someone comes up with a better search engine, Google is toast. There's no reason you would stay. This risk provides Google a good incentive to keep improving.\u201d This is what economists call a \u201ccontestable market\u201d, he said. New entrants could wipe out Google overnight.  <br/>Facebook\u2019s controversy comes at a time when public pressure is mounting on big tech companies due to concerns over fake news, rogue advertising and meddling in elections. The hashtag #deletefacebook is gaining traction on social media. People associated with Facebook are turning on the company. For example, Brian Acton, the co-founder of WhatsApp, which Facebook purchased for nearly US$20 billion (163;14 billion) in 2014, publicly endorsed the idea that users should delete Facebook.  <br/>\u201cPressure from consumer groups is useful,\u201d said Professor Savva. \u201cBut quitting Facebook for a different social network would require collective coordination, which is difficult to achieve. Pressure from advertisers is arguably more useful than pressure from consumers.\u201d  <br/>Last week, Commerzbank, Germany's second-largest bank, announced that it was pressing pause on its ad campaigns on the social network. It was later joined by US automotive retailer Pep Boys. In a statement, Pep Boys CMO Danielle Porto Mohn explained, \u201cWe are concerned about the issues surrounding Facebook and have decided to suspend all media on the platform until the facts are out and corrective actions have been taken.\u201d  <br/>\u201cFacebook users are the product of the network,\u201d said Professor Savva. \u201cBut advertisers generate the positive cash flow so, therefore, they are the customers. Pressure from them, and threats to move their advertising to different digital channels, would be hard to ignore.\u201d  <br/>Is Facebook worth our data? In 2016, Zuckerberg disclosed that the average person spent 50 minutes a day on the company\u2019s Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. \u201cAs a back-of-the-envelope calculation, the market cap of Facebook is around US$414 billion. It has dropped by about 6% over a week. It had 2.2 billion active users in the last quarter of 2017 (active meaning they have logged in at least once a month). If you do a straightforward division, it suggests that each user\u2019s data over their lifetime amounts to $200.  <br/>\u201cIt's not a huge amount of value when you think about it, but if you scale it up to 2.2 billion people it gives you a market cap that puts Facebook in the top 10 companies globally.  <br/>\u201cAs a customer, what do you get for giving $200 worth of information? You get to use the site for 50 minutes each day, on average, for the rest of your life. People might say that it's unfair, \u2018Our data is too valuable\u2019. But, actually, if you do the maths, I would certainly pay $200 over my life to gain access to Facebook \u2013 especially if I had assurances that my data wouldn\u2019t be shared with third parties\u201d  <br/>Regulation will play an important role in improving the practices of major tech players, he said.  <br/>\u201cThe lesson is that tech giants like Facebook need to be more transparent about what data they collect, how they collect it and who they share it with. They need to be more selective and they need clear processes in allowing third parties to use data.\u201d  <br/>As well as pressure from Facebook users and advertisers, legislation could be a powerful tool, \u201ceffective in instigating change\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s where GDPR is useful,\u201d said Professor Savva.  <br/>Such regulations could make it more difficult for organisations to collect data from users and customers, and to use it to target customers through third-party platforms such as Cambridge Analytica.  <br/><br/> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-RLPMN704573320180330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0D-GHP1-DXCW-D2JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 30, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has found himself with few defenders in the technology industry.<br/> Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk and Salesforce.com Inc.'s Marc Benioff have criticized the social media network in the wake of its user data scandal involving political-advertising firm Cambridge Analytica. Other tech leaders have remained quiet in the ensuing backlash against Facebook, in contrast to Silicon Valley's usual practice of rallying around its own during major crises.</p><p><br/> Facebook has sought to repair its public image and trust with more than 2 billion users after reports surfaced that Cambridge Analytica obtained data on as many 50 million of those U.S. accounts. As Zuckerberg, 33, faces calls to testify before Congress and lawmakers raise the idea of new regulations on tech, his peers have either stayed quiet or publicly criticized his company. In times of crisis, tech companies have sometimes huddled together to defend the industry, such as when Apple fought the FBI to protect an encrypted iPhone and during President Donald Trump's proposed immigration ban last year against mostly Muslim countries.<br/> \"Protecting privacy is good for business now,\" said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization that advocates for digital privacy. \"Users are looking for other big tech personalities like Tim Cook, like Elon Musk, to be reassured that they're not doing what Facebook did.\"<br/> When Apple was fighting an FBI attempt to get into an encrypted iPhone, Facebook joined Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp. and other large tech firms to support Cook's stance. Still, Apple executives, including Steve Jobs, have criticized internet companies' advertising business models in the past.<br/> Cook was asked about Facebook's privacy crisis last month and called for stronger regulation of user data. Then, in an interview with Recode and MSNBC, Cook said he \"wouldn't be in this situation\" if he were in Zuckerberg's shoes. While Facebook makes money selling targeted advertisements based on user data, Apple's profit comes from hardware products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/> Zuckerberg responded in an interview with Vox, published Monday: \"I find that argument - that if you're not paying, that somehow we can't care about you - to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth.\"<br/> \"There are a lot of people who can't afford to pay\" for a service and that having an \"advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people,\" Zuckerberg said. \"If you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford.\"<br/> Facebook's shares have dropped 16 percent in the past two weeks since the Cambridge Analytica issue surfaced.<br/> The criticism from others in the industry may reveal a division in attitudes between social media and other types of tech companies that don't rely on personal data for advertising businesses.<br/> \"In a normal state, I wouldn't expect Tim Cook to be a natural defender of Facebook's interests,\" said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Evercore ISI.<br/> Since social media companies have to leverage user data in order to better sell to advertisers, it becomes harder for them to promise strong privacy while retaining a robust business model.<br/> Gebhart said that privacy is increasingly a selling point for technology users, but for social media companies, data abuses are a feature, not a bug.<br/> \"This is about the entire web surveillance-based and advertising-powered business model,\" she said. \"Facebook is just the worst or best at it, depending on your view of surveillance.\"<br/> Even social media company Snap Inc. seemed to be poking fun at Facebook's woes. For April Fools' Day, the Snapchat app rolled out a satirical filter with fake Cyrillic that mimicked Facebook's user interface. The bottom of the image said it was liked by \"your mom, a bot and 2 others.\" Some on Twitter interpreted the gag filter as a reference to Facebook's troubles with Russian meddling on its website.<br/> While WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton joined the #deleteFacebook bandwagon, Gebhart said other social media networks such as Twitter Inc. and Microsoft Corp.'s LinkedIn have mostly stayed quiet during the firestorm against their rival.<br/> Salesforce's Benioff, in contrast, has been vocal for months on the need for Facebook to be regulated like tobacco, and reiterated that view last month at a company conference.<br/> \"I got in trouble with friends of mine at Facebook, who were calling me and very upset with me because I said, 'Facebook is the new cigarettes,\"' Benioff said. \"It's addictive, it's not good for you and there's outside forces trying to manipulate you to use it.\"<br/> Musk deleted the Facebook pages for his companies, Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., after a Twitter user asked him to last month.<br/> Musk later said he wasn't making a political statement, nor did he have the sites taken down because of pressure from Twitter users.<br/> \"Just don't like Facebook,\" he wrote. \"Gives me the willies. Sorry.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CFOIND-n10448397</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CFOIND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S18-1FJ1-DYDW-73CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CFO</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 3, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009DIT</classCode><className>SALESFORCE.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>CRM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Mr. Kohm \u2014 echoing Facebook\u2019s own argument \u2014 cautioned that Facebook was not responsible for the consulting firm\u2019s reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and most likely had not broken its promises to the F.T.C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">Cambridge Analytica</url> data leak set off a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\">reckoning for Facebook</url> and a far-reaching debate about the tech industry, which has collected more information about more people than almost any other in history. At the same time, the F.T.C., which is investigating Facebook, is under growing attack for what critics say is a systemic failure to police Silicon Valley\u2019s giants and their enormous appetite for personal data.</p><p>Almost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The F.T.C. serves as the country\u2019s de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech firms accused of misleading people about how their information is used.</p><p>But many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members, and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the F.T.C. has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebook inquiry looms as a referendum on the F.T.C.\u2019s future.</p><p>\u201cThey have been asleep at the switch,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.\u201d</p><p>Even if the agency does not penalize Facebook over the Cambridge incident \u2014 and some <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.harvardlawreview.org/facebook-cambridge-analytica-and-the-regulators-dilemma-clueless-or-venal/\">former F.T.C. officials disagree</url> with Mr. Kohm\u2019s reasoning \u2014 the commission could punish the company for other offenses. Former officials say they\u2019ve been told that its inquiry has expanded to include recent security and privacy breaches as well as Facebook\u2019s       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html\">secretive data-sharing deals</url> with Amazon, Netflix and other companies. Facebook declined to comment on the inquiry.</p><p>The agency \u2014 overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president\u2019s party \u2014 is habitually tight-lipped. Joseph J. Simons, the chairman, declined to comment on the Kohm memo.</p><p>\u201cIf the F.T.C. had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,\u201d Mr. Simons said in a statement. \u201cOur investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.\u201d</p><p>The agency\u2019s defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the F.T.C. to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.</p><p>\u201cThe act creating the F.T.C. was not designed with privacy in mind,\u201d said Jessica L. Rich, a consumer protection expert who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/biographies/jessica-l-rich\">formerly led</url> the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer bureau. \u201cThat they\u2019ve been able to bring hundreds of privacy and data security cases is actually quite a feat, not only given the limitations on their authority but the challenges companies have mounted, especially recently.\u201d</p><p>A Cautionary Tale</p><p>As the federal government\u2019s main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the F.T.C. has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robo-callers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.</p><p>But it is hampered by its relatively small size \u2014 about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency\u2019s enforcement arm, led by Mr. Kohm, doesn\u2019t have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the F.T.C. chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants.</p><p>\u201cThey have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,\u201d said Justin Brookman, a former F.T.C. official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.</p><p>F.T.C. officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the last decade.</p><p>Still, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech.</p><p>Critics said a greater problem was cultural. The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as \u201cKidVid.\u201d Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the F.T.C.\u2019s power to issue new regulations.</p><p>Even today, \u201cin just about every meeting I have at the F.T.C., staff mention KidVid,\u201d said Josh Golin, the executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>Fears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.</p><p>\u201cThey think of themselves as deal-makers, not cops,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. \u201cThey have an institutional culture of deference.\u201d</p><p>That has hobbled the agency\u2019s approach to tech giants, leading to inadequate responses to privacy violations or efforts to <url normalizedValue=\"https://openmarketsinstitute.org/commentary/open-markets-letter-to-ftc-regarding-facebook/\">squeeze out emerging competitors</url>, according to Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department and president of the consumer group Public Knowledge. The F.T.C. needs legislation to allow it to set new rules for the era of big tech, he argued.</p><p>In 2013, for example, F.T.C. commissioners overruled a staff recommendation to sue Google for abusing its dominance in search to harm rivals. Three years later, when Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking\">began merging data collected by several of its services</url>, including Gmail and the ad technology platform DoubleClick, consumer groups filed a complaint with the F.T.C. calling the practice \u201chighly deceptive.\u201d The agency took no public action.</p><p>Nor did the F.T.C. penalize Facebook after it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief fined Facebook $122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition.</p><p>(The social network said it had notified users of the change with new terms of service and allowed them to opt out of aspects of how Facebook used the data.)</p><p>The F.T.C. has defended its record on privacy, pointing for instance to a $22.5 million fine imposed on Google in 2012, for bypassing privacy settings in Apple\u2019s Safari browser in violation of a consent agreement. The fine was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/f-t-c-fines-google-22-5-million-for-safari-privacy-violations/\">largest civil penalty</url> in the agency\u2019s history.</p><p>Former officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.</p><p>Ashkan Soltani, who was the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist from 2014 to 2015, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn\u2019t see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi\u2019s data could not identify specific individuals.</p><p>Mr. Soltani argued that the F.T.C. needed to get ahead of a technology that would soon become highly intrusive. (He eventually persuaded the agency to investigate, and in 2015 the F.T.C. approved <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/09/ftc-approves-final-order-nomi-technologies-case\">a settlement with Nomi</url>.)</p><p>Today, dozens of companies gather, use or sell location information so precise that it can pinpoint a phone within a few yards. The data is so detailed that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html\">it can often be linked to a specific person</url> \u2014 and frequently harvested without clear consent.</p><p>Proving Harm</p><p>President Trump\u2019s arrival in Washington kicked off a period of uncertainty at the F.T.C. For 16 months, three of five seats remained vacant on the commission, which was initially led by an acting chairwoman, Maureen K. Ohlhausen, an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/635811/150401aeihumilitypractice.pdf\">advocate of \u201cregulatory humility.\u201d</url></p><p>Ms. Ohlhausen\u2019s staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic F.T.C. investigations.</p><p>In an interview, Ms. Ohlhausen denied ordering a slowdown and cited privacy actions she had brought against <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/02/paypal-settles-ftc-charges-venmo-failed-disclose-information\">PayPal</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/09/lenovo-settles-ftc-charges-it-harmed-consumers-preinstalled\">Lenovo</url>. But she acknowledged having argued against going after what she regarded as small cases, like Nomi.</p><p>With limited resources, she said, the F.T.C. should \u201cpursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.\u201d</p><p>But that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebook and Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm.</p><p>Two former staffers said Mr. Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.</p><p>In recent months, F.T.C. employees meeting with Mr. Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users\u2019 locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Mr. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams, and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting.</p><p>Mr. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Mr. Kohm \u201chas dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.\u201d</p><p>Follow Nicholas Confessore and Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @nickconfessore and @ceciliakang.

Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Mr. Kohm - echoing Facebook's own argument - cautioned that Facebook was not responsible for the consulting firm's reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and most likely had not broken its promises to the F.T.C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Cambridge Analytica data leak set off a  reckoning for Facebook and a far-reaching debate about the tech industry, which has collected more information about more people than almost any other in history. At the same time, the F.T.C., which is investigating Facebook, is under growing attack for what critics say is a systemic failure to police Silicon Valley's giants and their enormous appetite for personal data.</p><p>Almost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The F.T.C. serves as the country's de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech firms accused of misleading people about how their information is used.</p><p>But many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members, and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the F.T.C. has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebook inquiry looms as a referendum on the F.T.C.'s future.</p><p>\"They have been asleep at the switch,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. \"It's a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.\"</p><p>Even if the agency does not penalize Facebook over the Cambridge incident - and some former F.T.C. officials disagree with Mr. Kohm's reasoning - the commission could punish the company for other offenses. Former officials say they've been told that its inquiry has expanded to include recent security and privacy breaches as well as Facebook's secretive data-sharing deals with Amazon, Netflix and other companies. Facebook declined to comment on the inquiry.</p><p>The agency - overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president's party - is habitually tight-lipped. Joseph J. Simons, the chairman, declined to comment on the Kohm memo.</p><p>\"If the F.T.C. had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,\" Mr. Simons said in a statement. \"Our investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.\"</p><p>The agency's defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the F.T.C. to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.</p><p>\"The act creating the F.T.C. was not designed with privacy in mind,\" said Jessica L. Rich, a consumer protection expert who formerly led the F.T.C.'s consumer bureau. \"That they've been able to bring hundreds of privacy and data security cases is actually quite a feat, not only given the limitations on their authority but the challenges companies have mounted, especially recently.\"</p><p>A Cautionary Tale</p><p>As the federal government's main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the F.T.C. has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robo-callers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.</p><p>But it is hampered by its relatively small size - about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission - and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency's enforcement arm, led by Mr. Kohm, doesn't have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the F.T.C. chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants.</p><p>\"They have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,\" said Justin Brookman, a former F.T.C. official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.</p><p>F.T.C. officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the last decade.</p><p>Still, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech.</p><p>Critics said a greater problem was cultural. The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as \"KidVid.\" Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the F.T.C.'s power to issue new regulations.</p><p>Even today, \"in just about every meeting I have at the F.T.C., staff mention KidVid,\" said Josh Golin, the executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>Fears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.</p><p>\"They think of themselves as deal-makers, not cops,\" said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. \"They have an institutional culture of deference.\"</p><p>That has hobbled the agency's approach to tech giants, leading to inadequate responses to privacy violations or efforts to squeeze out emerging competitors, according to Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department and president of the consumer group Public Knowledge. The F.T.C. needs legislation to allow it to set new rules for the era of big tech, he argued.</p><p>In 2013, for example, F.T.C. commissioners overruled a staff recommendation to sue Google for abusing its dominance in search to harm rivals. Three years later, when Google began merging data collected by several of its services, including Gmail and the ad technology platform DoubleClick, consumer groups filed a complaint with the F.T.C. calling the practice \"highly deceptive.\" The agency took no public action.</p><p>Nor did the F.T.C. penalize Facebook after it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union's antitrust chief fined Facebook $122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition.</p><p>(The social network said it had notified users of the change with new terms of service and allowed them to opt out of aspects of how Facebook used the data.)</p><p>The F.T.C. has defended its record on privacy, pointing for instance to a $22.5 million fine imposed on Google in 2012, for bypassing privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser in violation of a consent agreement. The fine was the largest civil penalty in the agency's history.</p><p>Former officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.</p><p>Ashkan Soltani, who was the F.T.C.'s chief technologist from 2014 to 2015, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn't see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi's data could not identify specific individuals.</p><p>Mr. Soltani argued that the F.T.C. needed to get ahead of a technology that would soon become highly intrusive. (He eventually persuaded the agency to investigate, and in 2015 the F.T.C. approved a settlement with Nomi.)</p><p>Today, dozens of companies gather, use or sell location information so precise that it can pinpoint a phone within a few yards. The data is so detailed that it can often be linked to a specific person - and frequently harvested without clear consent.</p><p>Proving Harm</p><p>President Trump's arrival in Washington kicked off a period of uncertainty at the F.T.C. For 16 months, three of five seats remained vacant on the commission, which was initially led by an acting chairwoman, Maureen K. Ohlhausen, an advocate of \"regulatory humility.\"</p><p>Ms. Ohlhausen's staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic F.T.C. investigations.</p><p>In an interview, Ms. Ohlhausen denied ordering a slowdown and cited privacy actions she had brought against PayPal and Lenovo. But she acknowledged having argued against going after what she regarded as small cases, like Nomi.</p><p>With limited resources, she said, the F.T.C. should \"pursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.\"</p><p>But that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebook and Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm.</p><p>Two former staffers said Mr. Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.</p><p>In recent months, F.T.C. employees meeting with Mr. Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users' locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Mr. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams, and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting.</p><p>Mr. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Mr. Kohm \"has dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Nicholas Confessore and Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @nickconfessore and @ceciliakang.Michael LaForgia contributed reporting.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006279503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3H-4PW1-JC85-N1N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 2, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But I think this was clearly a mistake in retrospect,\" Mr Zuckerberg told CNN.</p><p>Alexander Nix, the head of Cambridge Analytica who was suspended on Tuesday, said in a secretly recorded video that his company had played a decisive role in Trump's election victory.</p><p> Related articles  The 13 CREEPY Facebook searches you didn't know your friends could do  This is EVERYTHING that's wrong with Facebook  </p><p>At the time, Facebook's settings allowed app developers to access the personal data of not just the people who used their app, but of all of their friends as well.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook has already taken the most important steps to prevent such a situation from happening again.</p><p>He told CNN the site would be reviewing thousands of apps in an \"intensive process\".</p><p>Facebook will ban developers who do not agree to an audit, and an app's developer will no longer have access to data from people who have not used that app in three months.</p><p>He said he was confident Facebook could \"get in front\" of the problem.</p><p>GETTY</p><p>Facebook has found itself in the centre of a spiralling scandal around user data and privacy</p><p>\"This isn't rocket science.

The New York Times has been in talks with Facebook, but a spokeswoman for the paper declined to comment on whether it had reached a deal.</p><p>The deal, for which News Corp will be paid a licensing fee, presented some obstacles due to the Journal's firm digital subscription business model. Now that the issue has been settled, the way is cleared for the product to launch by as early as the end of the month. The financial terms of the arrangement weren't disclosed.</p><p>The licensing fees Facebook is offering range from the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for smaller publishers to a few million for bigger ones, and substantially higher than that for the very largest outlets, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>\"People want to see high quality news on Facebook,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, the company's founder and chief executive.</p><p>\"I'm excited we'll have the chance to include award-winning journalism from The Wall Street Journal and other US News Corp properties in our news tab.\" Facebook has sought to include news from about 200 publications, although only offering to pay about a quarter of the news organisations that will be involved.</p><p>The News Corp arrangement would allow headlines from properties in its Dow Jones unit, including the Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, Financial News and Mansion Global, as well as the New York Post, to appear in the Facebook news section, linking to the publications' sites. For non-subscribers, links to Journal stories that are behind the site's paywall would trigger a prompt for the reader to sign up.</p><p>Certain headlines appearing in Facebook's news section will be curated by a team of editors, while others will be selected by the company's algorithm, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The \"Top News\" section will feature about 10 headlines selected by editors. Subsections such as sports or entertainment and a \"suggested for you\" section will be selected by algorithm. The feed won't include any advertising.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Journal reached a deal with Apple to take part in its subscription news bundle, Apple News +. In that arrangement, Apple is taking 50 per cent of the subscription revenue, with the Journal and other media companies that have participated - primarily magazine publishers - receiving a portion of the rest based on the amount of stories read, the Journal reported.</p><p>Other large publications, like the New York Times and the Washington Post, opted not to participate in the Apple deal.</p><p>The move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing legal and regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Alphabet Inc's Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, another long-running complaint from publishers.</p><p>News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed chief executive Jonah Peretti have both called on Facebook and Google to pay organisations that provide quality news.</p><p>\"Facebook deserves credit for recognising the principle of journalistic provenance,\" said News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson.\"Mark Zuckerberg seems committed to ensuring high quality journalism has a viable, valued future. It is absolutely appropriate that premium journalism is recognised and rewarded.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-dc1f41acf2ec11e9a55f8d30b523562b9d73d01691075151fbc69ba53a6b5303</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9S-29V1-JD3N-5172-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp; CO INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Facebook has announced new Terms of Service. The platform\u2019s new rules will allow it to \u201cremove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\u201d Facebook also encouraged users to \u201creport content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.\u201d Facebook said these rules will take effect October 1, 2020.    Facebook acknowledged: \u201cIf we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we\u2019ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review.\u201d   The exceptions to this however, are worrisome. The platform explained that there will be no recourse if users \u201cseriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.\u201d  Facebook choosing to crack down on content its moderators suspect will inspire regulation has vague, but massive implications for the platform\u2019s future. As it is, Facebook has already unleashed AI programs to scan Facebook for hate speech. The recent Community Standard Enforcement Report\u2019s Hate Speech tab, explained how \u201cproactive detection technology\u201d had ramped up Facebook\u2019s ability to restrict content before it circulates, citing that \u201cContent actioned increased from 5.7 million pieces of content in Q4 2019 to 9.6 million in Q1 2020.\u201d  Conservatives are under attack. Contact the FCC at 1-888-225-5322 and/or via the MRC\u2019s FCC contact form to give your take on the petition filed by the Department of Commerce regarding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on \u201chate speech\u201d and equal footing for conservatives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42975304954</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RG-0MH1-JCSC-J0CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"414\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewsBusters</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook has announced new Terms of Service. The platform\u2019s new rules will allow it to \u201cremove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\u201d Facebook also encouraged users to \u201creport content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.\u201d Facebook said these rules will take effect October 1, 2020.    Facebook acknowledged: \u201cIf we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we\u2019ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review.\u201d   The exceptions to this however, are worrisome. The platform explained that there will be no recourse if users \u201cseriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.\u201d  Facebook choosing to crack down on content its moderators suspect will inspire regulation has vague, but massive implications for the platform\u2019s future. As it is, Facebook has already unleashed AI programs to scan Facebook for hate speech. The recent Community Standard Enforcement Report\u2019s Hate Speech tab, explained how \u201cproactive detection technology\u201d had ramped up Facebook\u2019s ability to restrict content before it circulates, citing that \u201cContent actioned increased from 5.7 million pieces of content in Q4 2019 to 9.6 million in Q1 2020.\u201d  Conservatives are under attack. Contact the FCC at 1-888-225-5322 and/or via the MRC\u2019s FCC contact form to give your take on the petition filed by the Department of Commerce regarding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on \u201chate speech\u201d and equal footing for conservatives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42975816863</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RG-0MH1-JCSC-J1K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"414\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewsBusters</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat vying for the presidency, didn't have to search far and wide for ammunition in her salvo against Facebook and other technology giants.</p><p>Her own campaign, she said Monday, had become a case study in the need to curtail Facebook's power, after the company temporarily removed her ads flaying the social networking service as anti-competitive. She used the flap to warn that it was dangerous for cyberspace to be \"dominated by a single censor.\"</p><p>Facebook confirmed that it had briefly removed three ads sponsored by Warren's presidential campaign that \"violated our policies against use of our corporate logo.\" The material was nevertheless soon restored following a report in Politico.</p><p>\"In the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads,\" the company said in a statement to The Washington Post. Facebook declined to say how Warren's political ads had been targeted - whether it was human reviewers or the company's artificial intelligence tools. The service's advertising policies ban the use of \"f\" or the Facebook logo in place of the word \"Facebook.\"</p><p>The three ads in question featured an \"f\" in a text bubble, as well as symbols referring to Amazon and Google. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>\"Three companies have vast power over our economy and our democracy,\" read the ads, which were placed Friday. \"Facebook, Amazon, and Google. We all use them. But in their rise to power, they've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field in their favor.\"</p><p>Warren's presidential campaign has sponsored numerous ads on Facebook, including more than a dozen touting her plans, announced last week, to curtail the power of tech giants.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" the Democratic lawmaker wrote in a Medium post Friday that outlined her proposal.</p><p>Her plan would appoint regulators responsible for reversing certain tech mergers and would advance legislation barring platforms from participating in their own online marketplace, as Amazon does when the e-commerce giant sells goods alongside similar offerings on its website from competitors.</p><p>The most forceful approach to date, Warren's agenda speaks to growing disaffection with Internet juggernauts once carefully courted by Democrats. It sent tremors through Silicon Valley.

Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat vying for the presidency, didn't have to search far for ammunition in her salvo against Facebook and other technology giants.</p><p>Her own campaign, she said Monday, had become a case study in the need to curtail Facebook's power, after the company temporarily removed her ads flaying the social networking service as anti-competitive.</p><p> She used the flap to warn that it was dangerous for cyberspace to be \"dominated by a single censor.\"</p><p>Facebook confirmed that it had briefly removed three ads sponsored by Warren's presidential campaign that \"violated our policies against use of our corporate logo.\" The material was nevertheless soon restored following a report in Politico.</p><p> \"In the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads,\" the company said in a statement to The Washington Post. Facebook declined to say how Warren's political ads had been targeted - whether it was human reviewers or the company's artificial intelligence tools. The service's advertising policies ban the use of \"f\" or the Facebook logo in place of the word \"Facebook.\"</p><p> The three ads in question featured an \"f\" in a text bubble, as well as symbols referring to Amazon and Google. (Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)</p><p> \"Three companies have vast power over our economy and our democracy,\" read the ads, which were placed on Friday. \"Facebook, Amazon, and Google. We all use them. But in their rise to power, they've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field in their favor.\"</p><p> Warren's presidential campaign has sponsored numerous ads on Facebook, including more than a dozen touting her plans, announced last week, to curtail the power of tech giants.</p><p> \"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" the Democratic lawmaker wrote in a Medium post Friday that outlined her proposal.</p><p> Her plan would appoint regulators responsible for reversing certain tech mergers and would advance legislation barring platforms from participating in their own online marketplace, as Amazon does when the e-commerce giant sells goods alongside similar offerings on its website from competitors.</p><p> The most forceful approach to date, Warren's agenda speaks to growing disaffection with Internet juggernauts once carefully courted by Democrats.

For Libra to succeed it needs committed members, and while I have no knowledge of specific organizations plans to not step up, commitment to the mission is more important than anything else,\" he wrote in response to the rumors of cold feet. He then blasted the allegation that Facebook withheld information from partners, calling it \"BS\" and writing that it was \"categorically untrue.\"</p><p>According to Business Insider, Dante Disparte, head of policy at communications at the Libra Association, stated in an email to the publication that, all of the initial 28 backers of Libra are still participating. The Wall Street Journal has reported that representatives from the backing companies are set to meet in Geneva on Oct. 14 to review a charter for the Libra Association and appoint a board of directors.</p><p>Facebook first announced Libra in June, with a rollout set for some time next year.

Some investors grumbled, but most were happy to stay quiet as the stock surged. This week's plunge upended that dynamic, increasing calls for changes at the top. </p><p>\"It's never an issue until things go wrong,\" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. He thinks a change in Facebook leadership is inevitable, and said the latest numbers could hasten that. \"It's really hard to imagine the status quo holding.\" A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment. On Thursday, Facebook fell 20 percent, costing investors $120 billion - the biggest single-day loss for an individual stock in history. Facebook On Friday, Facebook shares declined $1.37 to $174.89. Shareholders who had weathered months of renewed debate over Facebook's role in society and the ethics of its business model suddenly turned tail when they realized growth had run out on Facebook's core money-making app. Growth rates will decline by \"high single-digit percentages\" each of the next two quarters, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said. The loss of faith emboldened voices that have called for Zuckerberg to share more of his voting power and give up his role chairing the board to a more independent figure. \"Zuckerberg answers only to Zuckerberg,\" said Jonas Kron, director of shareholder advocacy at Trillium Asset Management, which supported a shareholder proposal last year to replace Zuckerberg as chairman of the board. Since Thursday's sell-off, he has received new phone calls and emails from other investors expressing support. He declined to identify those people. For more than a year, Facebook and other social-media companies have been under fire from policy makers and regulators for letting fake news, trolls and Russian manipulators proliferate on their services. Now that they're cracking down, it's denting growth, spooking investors. Authentic accounts and real information may be good for business longer term. But Kron said Facebook could have avoided some of the trouble if Zuckerberg's power was checked by an independent chairman. Other big tech companies like Microsoft Corp., Apple and Alphabet split the roles of CEO and chairman. Twitter suffered its own stock-market plunge this week, dropping 21 percent on Friday after user growth stagnated. It is roughly the same age as Facebook and has a similar founder-led mentality, but it already has a separate executive chairman.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN58631289</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXT-4SD1-DYRV-42NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

In doing so, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive espouses a flawed idea that has become conventional wisdom: that a competitive \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d exists and the best way to fight bad ideas is to put out good ones so a discerning public can choose.</p><p>But unregulated markets for goods have been shown not to work; and it turns out that unregulated markets for ideas don\u2019t either. </p><p>The first critical flaw in Mr Zuckerberg\u2019s thinking is the idea that the marketplace for goods is efficient without regulation. Much of the thrust of economics over the past half century has been to understand what regulations are needed to ensure that markets work. We have tort laws that ensure accountability if someone is injured and we don\u2019t allow companies to pollute willy-nilly. We have fraud and advertising laws to protect consumers against deceptions \u2014 recognising that such laws circumscribe what individuals may say and publish. </p><p>The second serious flaw is the notion that there is no inherent difference between markets for ideas and goods. Several economists have shown, however, that ideas and goods are fundamentally different, and that there is a strong presumption that an unfettered marketplace for ideas would not work. Their research helps explain why we have fraud and truth-in-advertising laws: cigarette companies cannot simply say cigarettes are safe for your health, or pharmaceutical companies that opioids are non-addictive. Free marketeers, by contrast, argue, there should be no restraints: those who have better and alternative views (we might say, the \u201ctruth\u201d) concerning cigarettes or opioids would eventually win out. No need for regulations. And no need to worry about those who might suffer, before the truth really wins out. </p><p>The original promise of the internet was a free, competitive, transparent market without intermediaries. Things have obviously not worked out that way. Today\u2019s marketplace of ideas is neither free, competitive, nor transparent. </p><p>Market power, which drives Facebook\u2019s profits, means lack of equal access; the intermediaries control access and only those rich enough get to disseminate their ideas. That\u2019s not a free market. Moreover, the first principle of a competitive \u201cfree\u201d market is transparency. But a market in which no one knows what messages have been sent to whom is intrinsically non-transparent. </p><p>To put it another way: good information is necessary to make the marketplace for goods to work. Markets simply can\u2019t ensure this on their own. For instance, we regulate securities markets to ensure equal access in the form of the Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s full disclosure laws. </p><p>There is at least one more ingredient necessary to make markets work well: the absence of the use of force and intimidation. Regrettably, unregulated trolling on social media has become a fact of life. </p><p>Self-regulation of the internet won\u2019t work any better than self-regulation of banking did. There needs to be public regulation, especially because there may be complex societal trade-offs \u2014 and in the balancing, we can be sure that the big technology companies will look after their own interests, first of all. The recent announcement by Google that it would end third-party tracking of users from one website to another is a step in the right direction in terms of privacy. But it raises a host of concerns about reduced competition. Google\u2019s dominance in the advertising market is likely to become even greater. </p><p>Distortions in the marketplace for political ideas are even more important than those in the marketplace for goods. If I buy the wrong brand of snake oil because of fraud, it\u2019s mostly me who suffers. But if I vote for the wrong politician because of mis- or disinformation, then all of society suffers. </p><p>In the US, the big tech companies have sought immunity from \u201cintermediary liability.\u201d Freedom from intermediary liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act means there is no way to get recompense for the harms caused by false speech from perpetrators who can\u2019t be prosecuted. Imagine if you buy a Chinese-made product from Walmart and it turns out to be faulty. You can\u2019t sue the Chinese manufacturer. Your only recourse is to sue Walmart. But because of Section 230, you have no recourse whatsoever in the case of internet service providers or platform companies. </p><p>In short, without full transparency, without a mechanism for holding participants to account, without equal ability to transmit and receive information, and with unrelenting intimidation, there is no free marketplace of ideas. </p><p>One of the major insights of modern economics is that private and social incentives are often not well-aligned. If those who want to spread misinformation are willing to pay more than those who want to counter it, and if lack of transparency is more profitable than transparency, then Facebook\u2019s attitude says \u201cso be it\u201d.

It\u2019s complicated, to say the least.</p><p>I have a Facebook account, but I rarely use it. I need consistent mental health breaks from Twitter, though I criticize myself for not being one of those writers who seems to thrive on the platform. I have an on-again-off-again relationship with Instagram, downloading the app when I\u2019m lonely and bored, and deleting it after spending hours scrolling through pictures of perfectly plated pastas.</p><p>But like many people who are now isolated at home, anxious, afraid and far from family and friends, I\u2019m spending a lot of time on social media these days. I\u2019m messaging friends on Instagram and WhatsApp and streaming live videos. I\u2019m grateful for these tools but I squirm every time I see the subtle but conspicuous \u201cFrom Facebook\u201d at the bottom of the login pages. I wonder how much valuable information tech companies are mining about our psyches right now. What it means to them that usage is up and we\u2019re relying on them more than ever.</p><p>For a couple months before the pandemic started, I was catching up on a term that had been circulating for some time: \u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d Popularized by a Harvard researcher, Shoshana Zuboff, it\u2019s the idea that the current \u2014 and perhaps final \u2014 frontier of capitalism is human experience and, in particular, predictions of human experience. It\u2019s that technology pioneered by the likes of Google and Facebook that surveils us, often without our consent, to generate invaluable information about what we will do today, tomorrow and in the future. And it\u2019s a lucrative model that\u2019s making a select group of people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 rich; men who understand the tools of the trade and how they\u2019re being used.</p><p>It is, in essence, the business of collecting, buying and selling our personal data, and it\u2019s producing what Ms. Zuboff <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html\">calls</url> \u201cepistemic inequality\u201d: a dangerous situation whereby the invaluable knowledge and information these technologies collect about us is held by the few, who also just happen to be the increasingly powerful.</p><p>The urgency of Ms. Zuboff\u2019s message has been resonating with me this past week as people lose their livelihoods and their lives and analysts recommend Zoom, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix as the companies to invest in right now. Although CNBC<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html\">reports</url>Big Tech lost some $1.3 trillion in value last week, some see the industry as particularly poised to rebound.</p><p>One analyst on SeekingAlpha.com <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html\">predicts</url>Facebook will be \u201cexceptionally well positioned to survive from this crisis and thrive in and around the aftermath,\u201d while others <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html\">see</url>Facebook and Amazon as worthy of making their investment committee\u2019s \u201cbest ideas list.\u201d</p><p>I thought of surveillance capitalism as I opened Zoom for a webinar and saw a box pop up, asking me if I wanted to \u201copt out\u201d of Zoom sending my information to third parties. I clicked \u201cyes,\u201d but I wondered how many people would understand what it would mean to click \u201cno.\u201d I also thought about what else Zoom might be doing to compromise our privacy; according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html\">some</url>, it might not be good. I joked with colleagues about how much Zoom stock must be worth right now. (Up more than 19 percent on Monday morning, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html\">according</url> to CNBC.) And I debated with my partner over whether we should pre-order toilet paper on Amazon.</p><p>We already knew our world depended on social media and Big Tech, but this moment is proving just how true that is. It\u2019s a reminder of how different things are from past pandemics. In 1918 the so-called Spanish flu killed somewhere between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide. But knowledge and communication about the virus was limited by the technologies of the era; telegrams and printing presses were the norm, radios only just emerging.</p><p>When it comes to the options we have today to connect to each other in times of crisis, the reality couldn\u2019t be more different. And those brave souls who have decided to opt out of social media altogether might be finding themselves feeling more and more alone.</p><p>To exist in this world feels challenging in the best of times; to exist in this world without the technologies we\u2019ve come to rely on \u2014 even if they\u2019re exploiting us \u2014 feels downright impossible. In an ideal world, we would have dealt with the problem of big technology companies earlier. More governments would have passed laws regulating their activities and giving us a right to our privacy and our data. Big tech remains mostly unchecked and perhaps worst of all, unfathomable to the majority of us still struggling to make sense of what it means to code.</p><p>I know that throughout this crisis, I\u2019m giving Facebook invaluable information. I have no doubt my Instagram messages are being scanned and my Zoom meetings recorded. Data is being collected on how I act when I\u2019m afraid, when I\u2019m irreverent and when I\u2019m looking for a distraction. I know this, but I struggle to stop using these tools in the best of times, let alone the worst.</p><p>How our political and medical systems fare through this pandemic remains to be seen. But one thing that seems certain is that Big Tech is going to benefit from our time of need.</p><p>I know Facebook is watching me. And this whole relationship we got going on? It\u2019s complicated, but it\u2019s a relationship of convenience. Social media is like a bad habit I go back to in times of desperation, a terrible boyfriend I can\u2019t shake.

Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My relationship with social media? It's complicated, to say the least.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I have a Facebook account, but I rarely use it. I need consistent mental health breaks from Twitter, though I criticize myself for not being one of those writers who seems to thrive on the platform. I have an on-again-off-again relationship with Instagram, downloading the app when I'm lonely and bored, and deleting it after spending hours scrolling through pictures of perfectly plated pastas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But like many people who are now isolated at home, anxious, afraid and far from family and friends, I'm spending a lot of time on social media these days. I'm messaging friends on Instagram and WhatsApp and streaming live videos. I'm grateful for these tools but I squirm every time I see the subtle but conspicuous \"From Facebook\" at the bottom of the login pages. I wonder how much valuable information tech companies are mining about our psyches right now. What it means to them that usage is up and we're relying on them more than ever.</p><p>For a couple months before the pandemic started, I was catching up on a term that had been circulating for some time: \"surveillance capitalism.\" Popularized by a Harvard researcher, Shoshana Zuboff, it's the idea that the current - and perhaps final - frontier of capitalism is human experience and, in particular, predictions of human experience. It's that technology pioneered by the likes of Google and Facebook that surveils us, often without our consent, to generate invaluable information about what we will do today, tomorrow and in the future. And it's a lucrative model that's making a select group of people - mostly men - rich; menwho understand the tools of the trade and how they're being used.</p><p>It is, in essence, the business of collecting, buying and selling our personal data, and it's producing what Ms. Zuboff calls \"epistemic inequality\": a dangerous situation whereby the invaluable knowledge and information these technologies collect about us is held by the few, who also just happen to be the increasingly powerful.</p><p>The urgency of Ms. Zuboff's message has been resonating with me this past week as people lose their livelihoods and their lives and analysts recommend Zoom, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix as the companies to invest in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">right now. </emphasis>Although CNBC reports Big Tech lost some $1.3 trillion in value last week, some see the industry as particularly poised to rebound.</p><p>One analyst on SeekingAlpha.com predicts Facebook will be \"exceptionally well positioned to survive from this crisis and thrive in and around the aftermath,\" while others see Facebook and Amazon as worthy of making their investment committee's \"best ideas list.\"</p><p>I thought of surveillance capitalism as I opened Zoom for a webinar and saw a box pop up, asking me if I wanted to \"opt out\" of Zoom sending my information to third parties. I clicked \"yes,\" but I wondered how many people would understand what it would mean to click \"no.\" I also thought about what else Zoom might be doing to compromise our privacy; according to some, it might not be good. I joked with colleagues about how much Zoom stock must be worth right now. (Up more than 19 percent on Monday morning, according to CNBC.)And I debated with my partner over whether we should pre-order toilet paper on Amazon.</p><p>We already knew our world depended on social media and Big Tech, but this moment is proving just how true that is. It's a reminder of how different things are from past pandemics. In 1918 the so-called Spanish flu killed somewhere between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide. But knowledge and communication about the virus was limited by the technologies of the era; telegrams and printing presses were the norm, radios only just emerging.</p><p>When it comes to the options we have today to connect to each other in times of crisis, the reality couldn't be more different.

Threats to sanction it for privacy violations, break up the company's monopolistic hold on social media, and prevent it from operating a cryptocurrency, have all been met with the same scare tactic: \"But China\" Facebook's defense against being regulated or having certain parts of it shut down seems to rely on arguments that if it is not allowed to do what it wants, China will step in to fill the void and threaten our national security. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, VP of Communications Nick Clegg, and others have expressed this opinion on several occasions. </p><p>In testimony before Congress this week, Facebook's head of blockchain development David Marcus said that if Facebook were not allowed to offer its Libra cryptocurrency, someone else would come up with their own (insinuating China), thus threatening US national security.'I believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will,' Marcus read in a prepared statement[1] before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday. 'If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different. I believe if we stay put we're going to be in a situation in 10, 15 years where half the world is on a blockchain technology that is out of reach of our national-security apparatus.'His comments are in response to a recent bill introduced[2] in the House of Representatives called the Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act, which we reported about on Monday. If adopted, the law would prevent firms that generate over $25 billion in annual revenue from establishing, maintaining, or operating a digital asset 'that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function.'Facebook is trying to contend that the creation of cryptocurrencies is inevitable and that it would be better if US entities were controlling it rather than foreign and potentially hostile actors. The stance is a reflection of something Zuck said in an interview last year regarding the potential breakup of Facebook. 'I think that the alternative, frankly, is going to be the Chinese companies,' Zuckerberg told Recode[3]. '[If regulators] clip the wings of these companies and make it so that it's harder for them to operate in different places, then there are plenty of other companies out [there] that are willing and able to take the place of the work that we're doing. [The Chinese] do not share the values that we have.'The Facebook boss added that China would be less inclined to do anything about election interference or terrorism.Business Insider[4] notes that communications chief Nick Clegg said essentially the same thing during a speech in Brussels back in January.'We don't hear so much about China, which combines astonishing ingenuity with the ability to process data on a vast scale without the legal and regulatory constraints on privacy and data protection that we require on both sides of the Atlantic,' Clegg said referring to the increasing restrictions and scrutiny the company is facing.David Marcus' testimony is more of the 'if we don't, then China will' scare tactics that the company has been employing for over the last year, despite[5] multiple[6] reports[7] of Facebook being quite friendly with China.Whether the bombastic rhetoric has any effect on lawmakers who want to see the company taken down a notch remains to be seen. Ultimately, China is going to do what China is going to do regardless of whether or not Facebook beats them to it.Lead image credit: Ascannio[8] via Shutterstock Related Reads  Share this article:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/81007-facebook-dont-regulate-us-or-china-take-over.html#Share\">https://www.techspot.com/news/81007-facebook-dont-regulate-us-or-china-take-over.html#Share</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81007-facebook-dont-regulate-us-or-china-take-over.html...le=Facebook:%20Don't%20regulate%20us%20or%20China%20will%20take%20over\">https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81007-facebook-dont-regulate-us-or-china-take-over.html...le=Facebook:%20Don't%20regulate%20us%20or%20China%20will%20take%20over</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-116-ba00-wstate-marcusd-20190717.pdf\">https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-116-ba00-wstate-marcusd-20190717.pdf</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/80960-us-lawmakers-reportedly-trying-block-big-tech-companies.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/80960-us-lawmakers-reportedly-trying-block-big-tech-companies.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17575156/mark-zuckerberg-interview-facebook-recode-kara-swisher\">https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17575156/mark-zuckerberg-interview-facebook-recode-kara-swisher</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-lobbyist-nick-clegg-europe-should-worry-about-china-internet-2019-1\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-lobbyist-nick-clegg-europe-should-worry-about-china-internet-2019-1</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/70558-colorful-balloons-app-facebook-secretly-launched-china-isnt.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/70558-colorful-balloons-app-facebook-secretly-launched-china-isnt.html</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/74952-facebook-shared-user-data-four-chinese-manufacturers-including.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/74952-facebook-shared-user-data-four-chinese-manufacturers-including.html</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/67151-facebook-has-reportedly-built-censorship-technology-can-return.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/67151-facebook-has-reportedly-built-censorship-technology-can-return.html</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/stone-staffordshire-united-kingdom-july-14-1450700366?src=tS-emcpUAu3s0KkaQgZ_Jw-1-35...dio=1\">http://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/stone-staffordshire-united-kingdom-july-14-1450700366?src=tS-emcpUAu3s0KkaQgZ_Jw-1-35...dio=1</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT1338811563405644326251761700114</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-KN21-F03R-N2N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"857\"/><timeReceived>11:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TechSpot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is not quite the same as Instagram, where we can put up pictures of what we want the world to see of us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">InstaGrat is the instant gratification that is engineered into almost every social media application that we use today. It is that soft, sudden feeling of 'aah' that comes and goes, without quite making the same mess or causing all the same guilt of other sources of dopamine-shot releasing activities that boomers, Gen Xers and even nominally normal millennial creatures used to be used to.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, every human being within six feet of a smartphone and forty five miles of a 4G cell tower, has access to InstaGrat. And most of us are ODing on InstaGrat without ever knowing who we're working for as we furiously type out our rage against the machine on Facebook, or whilst we jealously click 'Like' on Insta videos of beautiful people with eyelashes thick as a brick, and cheekbones higher than the Himalayas, or as we mass forward the latest outrageous video of yet another injustice in this relentlessly cruel world over WhatsApp. With every click, every forward, and every expression of how we feel, we feel like we feel better (we don't really). That's InstaGrat.</p><p>The human physiology that Mark Zuckerberg, who runs Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, or Jack Dorsey, who runs Twitter, are exploiting is not particularly complicated, once we consider the wider ecosystem in which their algorithms are operating. Sean Parker, who founded Napster and was the first president of Facebook explains it in the best and most direct way possible: \"The thought process that went into building these applications was: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?'\".</p><p>A global army of ambitious technology entrepreneurs are being egged on, and cheerled into an abyss of micro-manipulations and macro-catastrophe, by venture capitalists and Wall Street bankers, eagerly seeking the next Snapchat or the next TikTok, with little or no concern for how these technological applications are affecting individual and collective behaviors.</p><p>Of course, like any slow motion disaster, both state and society are so poorly equipped to handle the challenges posed by this phenomenon, that any attempt at addressing the problem likely only exacerbates it. For one, the easiest way to draw regulatory or legislative attention to these problems is to demonize the companies and individuals involved. Strangely, and paradoxically, this satisfies our insatiable need for InstaGrat, but it doesn't actually solve the underlying problems that are driving us over the cliff, way, way over the speed limit.</p><p>The role of social media in voice creation and amplification for ordinary people all around the world is no less revolutionary, at least in theory, than Gutenberg's printing press. But the human technology that fuels the magnitude of social media's impact seems as or more likely to be exploited by wealthy people at the expense of the non-wealthy quite exactly in the same way as any technological revolution ever did before, from the printing press, to the steam engine, to the radio and television.</p><p>Chamath Palihapitiya, who was once responsible for 'user growth' at Facebook, recently explained his personal guilt about being associated with the social media business in rather stark and extreme terms, suggesting that the 'short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works'. And if you take a long hard look at some of the evidence, this hyperbole may not be all wrong.</p><p>Last year, Trevor Haynes, a researcher at the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, wrote about dopamine and smartphones, claiming that social media applications essentially 'leverage the very same neural circuitry used by slot machines and cocaine to keep us using their products as much as possible'. Now consider this: slot machines are heavily regulated by gaming or gambling commissions in some nations and entirely banned in many others. Cocaine, on the other hand, is a banned, illegal substance pretty much everywhere on planet earth. Yet there is hardly any country on the very same planet where social media is fully regulated (unless of course, we consider North Korea, or Iran, or China to be models of regulation).</p><p>The China question especially interesting, especially from the vantage point of Pakistan. The newest global fad among social media platforms is an application called TikTok. TikTok has about 12 million Pakistani users, which is nearly twice the number of Twitter users in the country - despite having only existed since 2017 (Twitter is about eleven years older, having been founded in 2006). So many of the world's most important people and pressing issues use Twitter as a source and an amplifier, but hardly any use TikTok. Why? Because unlike Twitter, TikTok is actually fun. It is video, after video, after video of inane (and sometimes insane) young people having fun.</p><p>Since it is all about the 'fun', it is explicitly apolitical, or at least it says it wants to be. This matters little in the United States, where earlier this month, the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) initiated a national security investigation into TikTok. The ostensible reason is around concerns about user privacy, but this is about as believable as Alice Well's anguish about Pakistan's long-term external debt profile. The real reason that any technology company ends up in ostensibly hot water in the US is the ability of an antagonist to link the company to either Russia or China.</p><p>The national security angle to how countries respond to technology challenges is typical of the vulgarity and lack of sophistication that defines how public imagination is engaged on big tech's threat to our individual and collective well being and safety. Any country can manipulate the algorithms deployed by companies like Snapchat, or WhatsApp, or Twitter. The real question is whether governments and societies are willing to engage in a serious conversation about InstaGrat. This is unlikely.</p><p>The constant highs that social media applications offer through instant gratification undermine our ability to engage with information beyond the very temporary and superficial level. This means that any given viral video can have massive impact in terms of how fast it reaches people. Sometimes, this will produce 'instant' results - like the closure of a restaurant or a medicine store after viral videos of wrongdoing by such establishments surface. But these 'results' will not and cannot produce better legislation or regulation, or more vigilant enforcement of existing laws or rules. Decision-makers are just like all the rest of us. They too are being re-wired like the rest of us, and will therefore respond, and react more readily to the 'instant' notification, rather than the wider, creeping signs that scream out for reform.</p><p>InstaGrat heightens and transforms the micro-outrage into the macro-moment. But a moment is just that: a blip in time. Societies and countries are at sea in the face of a blitzkrieg of algorithms that have all the potential to positively transform the very micro-interactions within the human physiology that they have deconstructed and cracked. But this potential is being lost to the allure of the InstaGrat. We do not need a hashtag to do better. We just need to learn to say no to instant gratification. Can you say no?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSNTL-TNEWSINT2611201900157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSNTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKN-15Y1-JCH9-G3DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423892</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1241\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The News International All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News International</publicationName><volume>Vol. 29</volume><issueNumber>No. 344</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The accusation stems from a 2012 lawsuit. </p><p>  The complaint, filed by 17 groups including Common Sense Media, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy, says the purchases were often done without a parent's permission. In some cases, they amounted to hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p><p>  ''<person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>exploitative practices targeted a population universally recognized as vulnerable -- young people,'' the groups said in the complaint.</p><p>  In Washington's greater focus on the power of Big Tech, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has taken center stage. The social network's role in state-sponsored election interference, harmful content and privacy violations has set off a push for new privacy laws and multiple investigations of the company. Next week, Congress will debate proposals for a federal privacy law.</p><p>  The F.T.C. started investigating <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in March after The New York Times reported that the data of tens of millions of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users was unknowingly shared with the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The agency is in the final stages of that investigation, with staff members and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>negotiating over a potential settlement that could include a multibillion-dollar fine and new restraints on the company's business practices, according to people familiar with the talks.</p><p>  The consumer groups do not believe the complaint will be included in the F.T.C.'s privacy investigation of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>because that case appears to be nearing its completion.</p><p>  But the children's advocacy groups said they hoped their complaint would continue a drumbeat of pressure for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to take more forceful steps to change its business practices oriented toward children.</p><p>  ''This is a pattern of behavior,'' said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media. ''<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has a moral obligation to change its culture towards practices that foster the well-being of kids and families, and the F.T.C. should ensure <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is acting responsibly.''</p><p>  In a statement, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>said that in 2016 it had updated some of its policies governing purchases by minors.</p><p>  ''We have in place mechanisms to prevent fraud at the time of purchase, and we offer people the option to dispute purchases and seek refunds,'' the statement said. ''As part of our long history of working with parents and experts to offer tools for families navigating <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and the web, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>also has safeguards in place regarding minors' purchases.''</p><p>  The F.T.C. declined to comment.</p><p>  Details about the in-app purchases came from court documents that were unsealed at the request of the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit journalism organization. The documents were part of a class-action lawsuit brought in 2012 and settled in 2016 for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>  The 135 pages of unsealed documents included internal corporate memos and emails in which <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>employees encouraged game developers to create features that would get children to make credit card charges while playing games. In many cases, the children did not realize that their parents' credit cards were attached to the games or that they were spending real money, the consumer groups argued in their complaint.</p><p>  The F.T.C. polices consumer fraud, deception and unfair practices and is well versed in the issue of in-app purchases -- the charges made within an app and directly charged through iTunes or Google Play stores, for example.</p><p>  In 2013, the agency started an investigation into major charges by children using in-app purchases for things like ''gold coins'' in smartphone games. The F.T.C. reached a $32.5 million settlement with Apple and a $19 million settlement with Google over accusations that children were deceived into making such purchases and that the companies did not properly disclose to parents that they were being charged for their children's purchases.</p><p>  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         </p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: The F.T.C. is being urged to investigate whether <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>violated laws by asking children to make in-app purchases in Angry Birds and other games.       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-709360190222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGH-GKP1-JBG3-61BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/facebook-children-privacy.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/facebook-children-privacy.html</url><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook says it only uses data on age and location of users to determine who sees information about a particular election.<br/>The Irish Data Protection Commission, the leader regulation for Facebook in the European Union, informed the tech giant that it had concerns about the feature ahead of Irish parliamentary elections on Feb. 8.<br/>While the regulator sought a number of remedial actions, it was not possible to implement these in advance of the Irish vote, and Facebook agreed not to use the feature in the election, it said.<br/>Ireland hosts the European headquarters of a number of U.S. technology firms including Facebook, making Ireland's Data Protection Commission the EU's lead regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) \"One Stop Shop\" regime introduced in 2018.<br/>The rules give regulators the power to impose fines for violations of up to 4% of a company's global revenue or 20 million euros ($22 million), whichever is higher.<br/>The Irish regulator had 21 inquiries open into big tech firms at the end of 2019 with eight probes into Facebook, plus two into Facebook-owned WhatsApp and one into Facebook-owned Instagram.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-711823</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YFP-5H01-DYDW-72NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 18, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Since 2014, Facebook has posted reminders on its website during elections and referendums in EU countries with a button that allows users to indicate on their timeline whether they voted. But Ireland's Data Protection Commission said in a statement Facebook will not use the feature in elections in the European Union until concerns are addressed. </p><p>The regulator did not specify what data might be gathered by Facebook or their specific concerns over how it might be used. Data on whether a user voted or was interested in politics might be of value to potential advertisers or political parties. \"Facebook has confirmed that the Election Day Reminder feature will not be activated during any EU elections pending a response to the DPC addressing the concerns raised,\" the regulator said. In particular, the feature \"raised a number of data protection concerns particularly around transparency to users about how personal data is collected when interacting with the feature and subsequently used by Facebook\", it said. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook says it only uses data on age and location of users to determine who sees information about a particular election. The Irish Data Protection Commission, the leader regulation for Facebook in the European Union, informed the tech giant that it had concerns about the feature ahead of Irish parliamentary elections on Feb. 8. While the regulator sought a number of remedial actions, it was not possible to implement these in advance of the Irish vote, and Facebook agreed not to use the feature in the election, it said. Ireland hosts the European headquarters of a number of U.S. technology firms including Facebook, making Ireland's Data Protection Commission the EU's lead regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) \"One Stop Shop\" regime introduced in 2018. The rules give regulators the power to impose fines for violations of up to 4per cent of a company's global revenue or 20 million euros (US$22 million), whichever is higher. The Irish regulator had 21 inquiries open into big tech firms at the end of 2019 with eight probes into Facebook, plus two into Facebook-owned WhatsApp and one into Facebook-owned Instagram.

This is grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression and respect for the democratic process, as well as the fact that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.</p><p><br/><br/>You can read the full text of my speech below, but as I know there are often lots of questions about our policies and the way we enforce them I thought I'd share the key details.<br/><br/>We rely on third-party fact-checkers to help reduce the spread of false news and other types of viral misinformation, like memes or manipulated photos and videos. We don't believe, however, that it's an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician's speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny. That's why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program. We have had this policy on the books for over a year now, posted publicly on our site under our eligibility guidelines. This means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review. However, when a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, we plan to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements. You can find more about the third-party fact-checking program and content eligibility here.<br/><br/>Facebook has had a newsworthiness exemption since 2016. This means that if someone makes a statement or shares a post which breaks our community standards we will still allow it on our platform if we believe the public interest in seeing it outweighs the risk of harm. Today, I announced that from now on we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard. However, in keeping with the principle that we apply different standards to content for which we receive payment, this will not apply to ads - if someone chooses to post an ad on Facebook, they must still fall within our Community Standards and our advertising policies.<br/><br/>When we make a determination as to newsworthiness, we evaluate the public interest value of the piece of speech against the risk of harm. When balancing these interests, we take a number of factors into consideration, including country-specific circumstances, like whether there is an election underway or the country is at war; the nature of the speech, including whether it relates to governance or politics; and the political structure of the country, including whether the country has a free press. In evaluating the risk of harm, we will consider the severity of the harm. Content that has the potential to incite violence, for example, may pose a safety risk that outweighs the public interest value. Each of these evaluations will be holistic and comprehensive in nature, and will account for international human rights standards.<br/><br/>Read the full speech below.<br/><br/>Facebook<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know me, which I suspect is most of you, I used to be a politician - I spent two decades in European politics, including as Deputy Prime Minister in the UK for five years.<br/><br/>And perhaps because I acquired a taste for controversy in my time in politics, a year ago I came to work for Facebook.<br/><br/>I don't have long with you, so I just want to touch on three things: I want to say a little about Facebook; about how we are getting ourselves ready for the 2020 election; and about our basic attitude towards political speech.<br/><br/>So...Facebook.<br/><br/>As a European, I'm struck by the tone of the debate in the US around Facebook. Here you have this global success story, invented in America, based on American values, that is used by a third of the world's population.<br/><br/>A company that has created 40,000 US jobs in the last two years, is set to create 40,000 more in the coming years, and contributes tens of billions of dollars to the economy. And with plans to spend more than $ 250 billion in the US in the next four years.<br/><br/>And while Facebook is subject to a lot of criticism in Europe, in India where I was earlier this month, and in many other places, the only place where it is being proposed that Facebook and other big Silicon Valley companies should be dismembered is here.<br/><br/>And whilst it might surprise you to hear me say this, I understand the underlying motive which leads people to call for that remedy - even if I don't agree with the remedy itself.<br/><br/>Because what people want is that there should be proper competition, diversity, and accountability in how big tech companies operate - with success comes responsibility, and with power comes accountability.<br/><br/>But chopping up successful American businesses is not the best way to instill responsibility and accountability. For a start, Facebook and other US tech companies not only face fierce competition from each other for every service they provide - for photo and video sharing and messaging there are rival apps with millions or billions of users - but they also face increasingly fierce competition from their Chinese rivals. Giants like Alibaba, TikTok and WeChat.<br/><br/>More importantly, pulling apart globally successful American businesses won't actually do anything to solve the big issues we are all grappling with - privacy, the use of data, harmful content and the integrity of our elections.<br/><br/>Those things can and will only be addressed by creating new rules for the internet, new regulations to make sure companies like Facebook are accountable for the role they play and the decisions they take.<br/><br/>That is why we argue in favor of better regulation of big tech, not the break-up of successful American companies.<br/><br/>Elections<br/><br/>Now, elections. It is no secret that Facebook made mistakes in 2016, and that Russia tried to use Facebook to interfere with the election by spreading division and misinformation. But we've learned the lessons of 2016. Facebook has spent the three years since building its defenses to stop that happening again.<br/><br/>* Cracking down on fake accounts - the main source of fake news and malicious content - preventing millions from being created every day;<br/><br/>* Bringing in independent fact-checkers to verify content;<br/><br/>* Recruiting an army of people - now 30,000 - and investing hugely in artificial intelligence systems to take down harmful content.<br/><br/>And we are seeing results. Last year, a Stanford report found that interactions with fake news on Facebook was down by two-thirds since 2016.<br/><br/>I know there's also a lot of concern about so-called deepfake videos. We've recently launched an initiative called the Deepfake Detection Challenge, working with the Partnership on AI, companies like Microsoft and universities like MIT, Berkeley and Oxford, to find ways to detect this new form of manipulated content so that we can identify them and take action.<br/><br/>But even when the videos aren't as sophisticated - such as the now infamous Speaker Pelosi video - we know that we need to do more.<br/><br/>As Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged publicly, we didn't get to that video quickly enough and too many people saw it before we took action. We must and we will get better at identifying lightly manipulated content before it goes viral and provide users with much more forceful information when they do see it.<br/><br/>We will be making further announcements in this area in the near future.<br/><br/>Crucially, we have also tightened our rules on political ads. Political advertising on Facebook is now far more transparent than anywhere else - including TV, radio and print advertising.<br/><br/>People who want to run these ads now need to submit ID and information about their organization. We label the ads and let you know who's paid for them. And we put these ads in a library for seven years so that anyone can see them.<br/><br/>Political speech<br/><br/>Of course, stopping election interference is only part of the story when it comes to Facebook's role in elections. Which brings me to political speech.<br/><br/>Freedom of expression is an absolute founding principle for Facebook. Since day one, giving people a voice to express themselves has been at the heart of everything we do. We are champions of free speech and defend it in the face of attempts to restrict it. Censoring or stifling political discourse would be at odds with what we are about.<br/><br/>In a mature democracy with a free press, political speech is a crucial part of how democracy functions. And it is arguably the most scrutinized form of speech that exists.<br/><br/>In newspapers, on network and cable TV, and on social media, journalists, pundits, satirists, talk show hosts and cartoonists - not to mention rival campaigns - analyze, ridicule, rebut and amplify the statements made by politicians.<br/><br/>At Facebook, our role is to make sure there is a level playing field, not to be a political participant ourselves.<br/><br/>To use tennis as an analogy, our job is to make sure the court is ready - the surface is flat, the lines painted, the net at the correct height. But we don't pick up a racket and start playing. How the players play the game is up to them, not us.<br/><br/>We have a responsibility to protect the platform from outside interference, and to make sure that when people pay us for political ads we make it as transparent as possible. But it is not our role to intervene when politicians speak.<br/><br/>That's why I want to be really clear today - we do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.<br/><br/>Of course, there are exceptions. Broadly speaking they are two-fold: where speech endangers people; and where we take money, which is why we have more stringent rules on advertising than we do for ordinary speech and rhetoric.<br/><br/>I was an elected politician for many years. I've had both words and objects thrown at me, I've been on the receiving end of all manner of accusations and insults.<br/><br/>It's not new that politicians say nasty things about each other - that wasn't invented by Facebook. What is new is that now they can reach people with far greater speed and at a far greater scale. That's why we draw the line at any speech which can lead to real world violence and harm.<br/><br/>I know some people will say we should go further. That we are wrong to allow politicians to use our platform to say nasty things or make false claims. But imagine the reverse.<br/><br/>Would it be acceptable to society at large to have a private company in effect become a self-appointed referee for everything that politicians say? I don't believe it would be.

This is grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression and respect for the democratic process, as well as the fact that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.</p><p><br/><br/>You can read the full text of my speech below, but as I know there are often lots of questions about our policies and the way we enforce them I thought I'd share the key details.<br/><br/>We rely on third-party fact-checkers to help reduce the spread of false news and other types of viral misinformation, like memes or manipulated photos and videos. We don't believe, however, that it's an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician's speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny. That's why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program. We have had this policy on the books for over a year now, posted publicly on our site under our eligibility guidelines. This means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review. However, when a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, we plan to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements. You can find more about the third-party fact-checking program and content eligibility here.<br/><br/>Facebook has had a newsworthiness exemption since 2016. This means that if someone makes a statement or shares a post which breaks our community standards we will still allow it on our platform if we believe the public interest in seeing it outweighs the risk of harm. Today, I announced that from now on we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard. However, in keeping with the principle that we apply different standards to content for which we receive payment, this will not apply to ads - if someone chooses to post an ad on Facebook, they must still fall within our Community Standards and our advertising policies.<br/><br/>When we make a determination as to newsworthiness, we evaluate the public interest value of the piece of speech against the risk of harm. When balancing these interests, we take a number of factors into consideration, including country-specific circumstances, like whether there is an election underway or the country is at war; the nature of the speech, including whether it relates to governance or politics; and the political structure of the country, including whether the country has a free press. In evaluating the risk of harm, we will consider the severity of the harm. Content that has the potential to incite violence, for example, may pose a safety risk that outweighs the public interest value. Each of these evaluations will be holistic and comprehensive in nature, and will account for international human rights standards.<br/><br/>Read the full speech below.<br/><br/>Facebook<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know me, which I suspect is most of you, I used to be a politician - I spent two decades in European politics, including as Deputy Prime Minister in the UK for five years.<br/><br/>And perhaps because I acquired a taste for controversy in my time in politics, a year ago I came to work for Facebook.<br/><br/>I don't have long with you, so I just want to touch on three things: I want to say a little about Facebook; about how we are getting ourselves ready for the 2020 election; and about our basic attitude towards political speech.<br/><br/>So...Facebook.<br/><br/>As a European, I'm struck by the tone of the debate in the US around Facebook. Here you have this global success story, invented in America, based on American values, that is used by a third of the world's population.<br/><br/>A company that has created 40,000 US jobs in the last two years, is set to create 40,000 more in the coming years, and contributes tens of billions of dollars to the economy. And with plans to spend more than $ 250 billion in the US in the next four years.<br/><br/>And while Facebook is subject to a lot of criticism in Europe, in India where I was earlier this month, and in many other places, the only place where it is being proposed that Facebook and other big Silicon Valley companies should be dismembered is here.<br/><br/>And whilst it might surprise you to hear me say this, I understand the underlying motive which leads people to call for that remedy - even if I don't agree with the remedy itself.<br/><br/>Because what people want is that there should be proper competition, diversity, and accountability in how big tech companies operate - with success comes responsibility, and with power comes accountability.<br/><br/>But chopping up successful American businesses is not the best way to instill responsibility and accountability. For a start, Facebook and other US tech companies not only face fierce competition from each other for every service they provide - for photo and video sharing and messaging there are rival apps with millions or billions of users - but they also face increasingly fierce competition from their Chinese rivals. Giants like Alibaba, TikTok and WeChat.<br/><br/>More importantly, pulling apart globally successful American businesses won't actually do anything to solve the big issues we are all grappling with - privacy, the use of data, harmful content and the integrity of our elections.<br/><br/>Those things can and will only be addressed by creating new rules for the internet, new regulations to make sure companies like Facebook are accountable for the role they play and the decisions they take.<br/><br/>That is why we argue in favor of better regulation of big tech, not the break-up of successful American companies.<br/><br/>Elections<br/><br/>Now, elections. It is no secret that Facebook made mistakes in 2016, and that Russia tried to use Facebook to interfere with the election by spreading division and misinformation. But we've learned the lessons of 2016. Facebook has spent the three years since building its defenses to stop that happening again.<br/><br/>* Cracking down on fake accounts - the main source of fake news and malicious content - preventing millions from being created every day;<br/><br/>* Bringing in independent fact-checkers to verify content;<br/><br/>* Recruiting an army of people - now 30,000 - and investing hugely in artificial intelligence systems to take down harmful content.<br/><br/>And we are seeing results. Last year, a Stanford report found that interactions with fake news on Facebook was down by two-thirds since 2016.<br/><br/>I know there's also a lot of concern about so-called deepfake videos. We've recently launched an initiative called the Deepfake Detection Challenge, working with the Partnership on AI, companies like Microsoft and universities like MIT, Berkeley and Oxford, to find ways to detect this new form of manipulated content so that we can identify them and take action.<br/><br/>But even when the videos aren't as sophisticated - such as the now infamous Speaker Pelosi video - we know that we need to do more.<br/><br/>As Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged publicly, we didn't get to that video quickly enough and too many people saw it before we took action. We must and we will get better at identifying lightly manipulated content before it goes viral and provide users with much more forceful information when they do see it.<br/><br/>We will be making further announcements in this area in the near future.<br/><br/>Crucially, we have also tightened our rules on political ads. Political advertising on Facebook is now far more transparent than anywhere else - including TV, radio and print advertising.<br/><br/>People who want to run these ads now need to submit ID and information about their organization. We label the ads and let you know who's paid for them. And we put these ads in a library for seven years so that anyone can see them.<br/><br/>Political speech<br/><br/>Of course, stopping election interference is only part of the story when it comes to Facebook's role in elections. Which brings me to political speech.<br/><br/>Freedom of expression is an absolute founding principle for Facebook. Since day one, giving people a voice to express themselves has been at the heart of everything we do. We are champions of free speech and defend it in the face of attempts to restrict it. Censoring or stifling political discourse would be at odds with what we are about.<br/><br/>In a mature democracy with a free press, political speech is a crucial part of how democracy functions. And it is arguably the most scrutinized form of speech that exists.<br/><br/>In newspapers, on network and cable TV, and on social media, journalists, pundits, satirists, talk show hosts and cartoonists - not to mention rival campaigns - analyze, ridicule, rebut and amplify the statements made by politicians.<br/><br/>At Facebook, our role is to make sure there is a level playing field, not to be a political participant ourselves.<br/><br/>To use tennis as an analogy, our job is to make sure the court is ready - the surface is flat, the lines painted, the net at the correct height. But we don't pick up a racket and start playing. How the players play the game is up to them, not us.<br/><br/>We have a responsibility to protect the platform from outside interference, and to make sure that when people pay us for political ads we make it as transparent as possible. But it is not our role to intervene when politicians speak.<br/><br/>That's why I want to be really clear today - we do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.<br/><br/>Of course, there are exceptions. Broadly speaking they are two-fold: where speech endangers people; and where we take money, which is why we have more stringent rules on advertising than we do for ordinary speech and rhetoric.<br/><br/>I was an elected politician for many years. I've had both words and objects thrown at me, I've been on the receiving end of all manner of accusations and insults.<br/><br/>It's not new that politicians say nasty things about each other - that wasn't invented by Facebook. What is new is that now they can reach people with far greater speed and at a far greater scale. That's why we draw the line at any speech which can lead to real world violence and harm.<br/><br/>I know some people will say we should go further. That we are wrong to allow politicians to use our platform to say nasty things or make false claims. But imagine the reverse.<br/><br/>Would it be acceptable to society at large to have a private company in effect become a self-appointed referee for everything that politicians say? I don't believe it would be. In open democracies, voters rightly believe that, as a general rule, they should be able to judge what politicians say themselves.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, I understand the debate about big tech companies and how to tackle the real concerns that exist about data, privacy, content and election integrity. But I firmly believe that simply breaking them up will not make the problems go away. The real solutions will only come through new, smart regulation instead.<br/><br/>And I hope I have given you some reassurance about our approach to preventing election interference, and some clarity over how we will treat political speech in the run up to 2020 and beyond.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Distributed by M2 Communications (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.m2.com\">www.m2.com</url>)) </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVEST-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVEST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4K-M901-JD3Y-Y4KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">276313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investrend Communications, Inc.

But will those tools censor other content? Can a program judge the value of speech?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg told Congress last week that his company is rapidly developing AI tools to \"identify certain classes of bad activity proactively and flag it for our team.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is one of several moves by Facebook as it struggles with an erosion of consumer trust over its harvesting of user data, its past vulnerability to targeted political misinformation and the opaqueness of the formulas upon which its news feeds are built.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some technologists believe that AI tools won't resolve these issues that Facebook and other social media companies face. </p><p>\"The problem is that surveillance is Facebook's business model: surveillance in order to facilitate psychological manipulation,\" Bruce Schneier, a well-known security expert and privacy specialist, said. \"Whether it's done by people or (artificial intelligence) is in the noise.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg said his Menlo Park, California, company relies on both AI tools and thousands of employees to review content. By the end of the year, he said, some 20,000 Facebook employees will be \"working on security and content review.\"</p><p>The company is developing its A.I. tools to track down hate speech and fake news on its platform and views the tools as a \"scalable way to identify and root out most of this harmful content,\" he said, indicating several times over 10 hours of testimony on two days that Facebook algorithms can find objectionable content faster than humans.</p><p>\"Today, as we sit here, 99 percent of the ISIS and al-Qaida content that we take down on Facebook, our AI systems flag before any human sees it,\" Zuckerberg said at a Senate hearing, referring to extremist Islamic groups.</p><p>The artificial intelligence systems work in conjunction with a counter-terrorism team of humans that Zuckerberg says numbers 200 employees. \"I think we have capacity in 30 languages that we're working on,\" he said.</p><p>Other existing AI tools \"do a better job of identifying fake accounts that may be trying to interfere in elections or spread misinformation,\" he said. After fake accounts placed political information on Facebook that disrupted the 2016 election, Facebook proactively took down \"tens of thousands of fake accounts\" before French and German elections in 2017, and Alabama's special election for a vacant Senate seat last December, he added.</p><p>Facebook is far from alone among social media companies harnessing artificial intelligence to assist humans monitoring content.</p><p>\"AI tools in concert with humans can do better than either can do alone,\" said Wendell Wallach, an investigator at The Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute in Garrison, New York.</p><p>But Wallach noted that many users do not understand artificial intelligence, and Big Tech may face a backlash like food concerns face over genetically modified (GMO) ingredients.</p><p>\"The leading AI companies, which happen to be the same as the leading digital companies at the moment, understand that there is a GMO-like elephant that could jump out of the AI closet,\" Wallach said. </p><p>Already, concern is mounting among conservatives on Capitol Hill that platforms like Facebook tilt to the political left, whether AI tools or humans are involved in making content decisions.</p><p>\"You recognize these folks?\" Rep. Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, asked Zuckerberg while holding up a photo of two sisters. </p><p>\"Is that Diamond and Silk?\" Zuckerberg asked, referring to two black social media personalities who are fervent supporters of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Indeed, it was, Long said, and Facebook had deemed them \"unsafe.\"</p><p>\"What is unsafe about two black women supporting President Donald J. Trump?\"</p><p>Zuckerberg later noted that his Facebook team \"made an enforcement error, and we've already gotten in touch with them to reverse it.\"</p><p>Artificial intelligence tools excel at identifying salient information out of masses of data but struggle to understand context, especially in spoken language, experts said.</p><p>\"The exact same sentence, depending on the relationship between two individuals, could be an expression of hate or an expression of endearment,\" said David Danks, an expert on ethics around autonomous systems at Carnegie Mellon University. He cited the use of the \"N-word,\" which between some people can be a friendly term, but is also widely considered hate speech in other contexts.</p><p>Any errors that AI tools make in such linguistic minefields could be interpreted as censorship or political bias that could further diminish trust in social media companies.</p><p>\"The general public, I think, is much less trusting of these companies,\" Danks said.</p><p>Eventually, he said, the algorithms and AI tools of a handful of companies will earn greater public trust, even as consumers do not understand how they operate.</p><p>\"I don't understand in many ways how my car works but I still trust it to function in all the ways I need it to,\" Danks said. </p><p>Just as librarians once used subjective judgment in taking books off the shelves, social media companies also can face criticism that AI tools can overreach.</p><p>\"Twitter faces this,\" said James J. Hughes, executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, in Boston. \"Pinterest and Instagram are always taking down artists' websites who happen to have naked bodies in them when they think they are porn, when they are not.</p><p>\"And they are doing that based on artificial intelligence algorithms that flag how much naked flesh is in the picture.\"</p><p>In his testimony, Zuckerberg said AI tools were increasingly adept at \"identifying fake accounts that may be trying to interfere in elections or spread misinformation.\" </p><p>Facebook has admitted that a Russian agency used Facebook to spread misinformation that reached up to 126 million people around the time of the 2016 presidential vote, and that the personal data of 87 million people may have been misused by the firm Cambridge Analytica to target voters in favor of Trump.</p><p>Zuckerberg told senators that Facebook's delay in identifying Russian efforts to interfere in the election is \"one of my greatest regrets in running the company\" and pledged to do better to combat manipulation for this year's election. </p><p>As legislators wrestled over whether Facebook and other social media companies need regulation, Zuckerberg repeatedly faced questions over the nature of his company. Is it also a media company because it produces content? A software company? A financial services firm that supports money transfers?</p><p>\"I consider us to be a technology company, because the primary thing that we do is have engineers who write code and build products and services for other people,\" Zuckerberg told a House hearing.</p><p>Experts say that answer doesn't address complex issues around platforms that are increasingly more like public utilities.</p><p>\"The electric company is not allowed to say, we don't like your political views therefore we are not going to give you electricity,'\" Danks said. \"If somebody is knocked off of Facebook, is that tantamount to the electric company cutting off their electricity? Or is it more like the person who is really loud and obnoxious in a bar, and the owner says, 'You need to leave now?'\"</p><p>Tim Johnson: 202-383-6028, @timjohnson4 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KRWB-B9716354455Z1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S41-WY81-JC3J-X1W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">293521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1229\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 McClatchy Washington Bureau All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>McClatchy Washington Bureau</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 16, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00080KU</classCode><className>AI SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000271</classCode><className>CENSORSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001710</classCode><className>TERRORISM</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY</classCode><className>Terrorism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000984</classCode><className>JUDGES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTg1QUIzNkIwNzk5NDQ4NzhGMDdDQjVGNEYyRjY5OTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURENzJGNTEyQzM0NEREQUI2RkVCRTM4RTc1RTZBREU</classCode><className>Judges</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FAF</classCode><className>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFND</classCode><className>ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ &amp;

The world's largest social media company is under pressure to improve its handling of data[2] after disclosing that information about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Facebook adjusted the privacy settings on its service on Wednesday[3], giving users control over their personal information in fewer taps. Facebook has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom and Experian. </p><p>The tool has been widely used among certain categories of advertisers - such as automakers, luxury goods producers and consumer packaged goods companies - who do not sell directly to consumers and have relatively little information about who their customers are, according to Facebook. 'While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook,' Graham Mudd, a Facebook product marketing director, said in a statement. Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to $25 after Facebook's announcement after the bell. Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged. A representative for Acxiom could not immediately be reached for comment. Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue. Advertisers would still be able to use third-party data services to measure how well their ads performed by examining purchasing data, Facebook said. Facebook's website lists nine third-party data providers that it has worked with, including Acxiom, Experian, Oracle Data Cloud, TransUnion and WPP. None of the companies could immediately be reached for comment. Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said. Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users' anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation. Facebook's shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook's lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation.Scrutiny From LawmakersFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers' access to user information. There is a new Facebook page - called Access Your Information - where users can see what they have shared and manage it. 'The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg's promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,' Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers. They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a 'right to portability' - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law. Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users' data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica. He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators. Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet and Twitter have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook[4], and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened[5].

Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged. A representative for Acxiom could not immediately be reached for comment.<br/> Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue.<br/> Advertisers would still be able to use third-party data services to measure how well their ads performed by examining purchasing data, Facebook said.<br/> Facebook's website lists nine third-party data providers that it has worked with, including Acxiom, Experian, Oracle Data Cloud, TransUnion, and WPP PLC.<br/> None of the companies could immediately be reached for comment.<br/> Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.<br/> Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users' anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.<br/> Facebook's shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.<br/> The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook's lifeblood and lead to tougher regulation.<br/> Scrutiny from lawmakers<br/> Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologised for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers' access to user information.<br/> There is a new Facebook page, called Access Your Information, where users can see what they have shared and manage it.<br/> \"The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfils Mark Zuckerberg's promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,\" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.<br/> It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers.<br/> They have announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a \"right to portability\", to take their data with them and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law.<br/> Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamouring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users' data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica. He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators.<br/> Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc, and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The US House Energy and Commerce Committee and US Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing.<br/> The US Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook, and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10443704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S06-5TR1-DYDW-73TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002PXL</classCode><className>ACXIOM CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001OOM</classCode><className>EXPERIAN PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002N6S</classCode><className>WPP PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000DIID</classCode><className>TRANSUNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>XIM (FRA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ACXM (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>EXPN (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>WPPGY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>WPP (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>TRU (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

But there will be many other ways to make money out of this, many of which are still to be identified.<br/>Mark Zuckerberg, with the irreverence that distinguishes him, announced that Facebook will release a currency, the LIBRA. According to Zuckerberg, the goal of LIBRA is to allow the \"bancarization\" of Facebook users without bank accounts (notably in countries with poorly developed banking systems). But, in my view, Zuckerberg's motivations are far more parochic, as is tradition in Sillicon Valley--competing with a traditional sector in a disruptive manner. In this case, the goal is the global payment system, competing directly with the banking through a business model facilitated by technology.</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>In the traditional version of the books of economics, the currency has three fundamental functions: means of payment (i.e. universally accepted by legal decree to settle transactions); Unit of value (i.e. how to measure the value of any and all products or services); and reserve of value (i.e. how to save and save purchasing capacity through time). The business model of traditional banks captures the value of the unique capacity to create currency granted by the central banks, and has as a counterpart a tight oversight-only these can generate credit and bank deposits and process payments From very few reservations, with the security of resorting to the central bank in difficult situations. Without this security there is no trust and without that trust there is no currency.<br/>\u00a0<br/>With LIBRA, the traditional currency will have a fourth function: source of information. It's easy to see that the currency is an extraordinary source of information and data. If the reader thinks what will be said about his life according to everything he trades: where he buys, what he buys, when he buys, how much he buys. The same happens for those who sell, for whom they lend or borrow.<br/>\u00a0<br/>What Zuckerberg expects, in my view, is to have access to this information and, with it, create value proposals for its customers and profits for the company. Facebook has already promised to protect customer information and not use it for advertising. But there will be many other ways to make money out of this, many of which are still to be identified. It should be noted that the panic over the provision of information is a reducing approach to the issue-the availability of data can be very beneficial for customers if, for example, allowing more effective credit and risk management that authorizes more interest rates Low or serve to anonymously feed the artificial intelligence platforms.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Will Facebook be able to compete with the traditional banking system? The concern is great. A few days after the announcement of Zuckerbeg, the G7 decided to set up a group to study the risks of these currencies and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) drew attention to the disruption that technology firms can cause in the financial system. This although several cryptocurrencies have arisen in recent years, with moderate success. After the bubble in 2017, Bitcoin recorded a remarkable appreciation and currently has a circulation of US $172b. The inventor of Bitcoin remains to be identified and his neoanarchist motivation is to reduce the power of central banks in the world economy. Will the LIBRA succeed?<br/>\u00a0<br/>The competitiveness of a currency has to do with confidence and low transaction costs. In this sense, LIBRA will have to be stable, commonly accepted, convenient and inexpensive to use if it wants to win. In my view, the possibility of LIBRA's success in these dimensions is real. Firstly, with regard to stability, an important technical point is that while theCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have a floating exchange regime (with its value oscillating according to the expectations of its owners), Facebook has set for the LIBRA a fixed currency exchange regime according to a set of traditional currencies. This point implies that the LIBRA will have a stable value, at least until gaining the trust of its users. The possibility of the exchange fluctuate and gain emitter power is for later, when the trust is a given.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Secondly, the POUND will take advantage of the network of 2, 37b users who have (in comparison, China has a population of 1, 38b). If you gain the confidence of your users your acceptance will be an immediate success and rival only the dollar in the world economy. Thirdly, a digital coin purse with interpersonal transfers will be the most convenient of the means of payment, as any MBWay user has ever discovered in Portugal.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Lastly, fourthly, it is in the costs that the competitive capacity of the LIBRA is more relevant. The traditional banking is now under pressure from a very heavy regulation and a negative interest rate environment that depletes the ability to finance banking activity. The alternative to traditional banking goes through the collection of commissions to users. To this business model, Facebook will counter the recipe of Sillicon Valley: Services offered at low price or free of charge in exchange for data and information that are usable to create and direct innovative offerings. Also here it is very likely that LIBRA is very competitive with traditional currencies and Facebook with the banking system. This is a fundamental lesson for banking, namely in Portugal: Digital transformation is not only technology, but above all the change in business and culture models that technology facilitates.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Monetizing data against charging for banking services-the race has begun! The great unknowns, in my view, are the reaction of regulators and central banks, and whether users will trust Zuckerberg to ensure the value of LIBRA. One thing is certain, the \"Big Tech\" took over once and for all as the big competitor of the bankroll.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Professor at Nova SBE<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-7418115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFC-4VW1-F03R-W29D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The US-based internet colossus maintained it has been cooperating with a European Commission antitrust investigation and will continue to do so, but that the wording of commission requests casts a net so wide it will haul in Facebook employees\u2019 private messages and more.    The leading social network expects to give the commission hundreds of thousands of documents, according to Facebook associate general counsel for competition Tim Lamb    \u201cThe exceptionally broad nature of the commission\u2019s requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission\u2019s investigations,\u201d Lamb said in response to an AFP inquiry.    Those documents include \u201chighly sensitive personal information such as employees\u2019 medical information; personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees.\u201d    Facebook thinks such requests should be reviewed by EU courts, according to Lamb, and is asking the court to weigh in on broad search terms such as \u201capplause\u201d or \u201cfor free\u201d that could easily be found in personal email messages or other exchanges way beyond the scope of antitrust matters.    Regulatory probes can involve requests for messages or documents bearing certain words or phrases, with those seeking information inclined to craft wide nets and those being queried wanting them narrowly targeted.    A highly anticipated US antitrust hearing, including top executives of four Big Tech firms, was originally set for Monday but has been postponed.    A notice filed by the House Judiciary Committee set no new date for the hearing titled \u201cExamining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.\u201d    The hearing would have conflicted with the memorial service for the late representative and civil rights leader John Lewis, who will lie in state in the US Capitol until Tuesday.    The antitrust hearing was called amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic and coincides with investigations at the federal and state levels into the online giants.    Chief executives Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet had agreed to participate in the session.

According to a new report[2] fromBusiness Insider, Facebook's newly-minted head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, spoke in Berlin on Monday, calling Apple \u2014 but not by name \u2014 an 'exclusive club' serving only 'aspirant consumers with the means to buy high-value hardware and services.' </p><p>Clegg, the former U.K. deputy prime minister, argued that criticisms about tailored advertising on the social network[3] fail to underscore that the product remains free for users, unlike products offered by Silicon Valley rivals. 'Facebook[4] is free \u2014 it's for everyone,' he said. 'Some other big tech companies make their money by selling expensive hardware or subscription services, or in some cases both, to consumers in developed, wealthier economies. They are an exclusive club, available only to aspirant consumers with the means to buy high-value hardware and services.' Both companies claim some piece of moral high ground as part of their brand. Clegg further added: 'There's no exclusivity at Facebook. No VIP access. No business class. Our services are as accessible to students in Guatemala, cattle farmers in the Midwest United States, office workers in Mumbai, tech startups in Nairobi, or taxi drivers in Berlin. More than 2 billion people use our platforms \u2014 because they can.' His remarks follow those of Apple CEO Tim Cook[5], who called an unnamed social media firm a 'chaos factory' during an address to Stanford University's graduating class. Cook was urging graduates to use tech for good when he made the remark.

Happy Mother's Day and welcome to RELIABLE SOURCES from CNN's brand-new studio here in New York City.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's what we have coming up for you this hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chelsea Manning is out of jail but facing another subpoena, which means she may be back in jail in just a few days. In the meantime, she's here to join me live for an exclusive interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, something many know a lot about, leak hunts. Another federal employee stands accused of slipping classified information to \"The Intercept\" website. \"The Intercept's\" top editor will join me live to react.</p><p>And later, to Fox or not to Fox. That's the question for Democrats. I'll speak with one of the people who was on Capitol Hill this week teaching lawmakers about how to appear on Fox News. What a job.</p><p>But first, today, the Facebook debate. Everybody has an opinion about Facebook. The company's actions and inactions have huge consequences for politics, business and news media.</p><p>And Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is coming out swinging with this op-ed in \"The New York Times\", declaring that the social network has become dangerous. He says Mark Zuckerberg's power is unprecedented and un-American, and he says the government must intervene by breaking up Facebook and enforcing new regulations.</p><p>Hughes dropped this op-ed on Thursday morning, then hopped on NPR, NBC, CNN, and he just appeared minutes ago on \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS.\"</p><p>And right now, Facebook is responding.</p><p>Nick Clegg is the company's new vice president for global affairs and communications and this is his first television interview.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here with me.</p><p>I think maybe we're having a little trouble with Nick. Let see if we can get him on.</p><p>All right. Little bit of trouble. What's that?</p><p>All right. A little bit of trouble here with the new set. That's OK. We're making a big move. We're going to get to Nick in a couple minutes.</p><p>In the meantime, while we work on that, let me bring in our panel. We've got an all-star panel. It's already. We're wired up and on set with us.</p><p>Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizer and Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, a little bit surprise here but if you don't mind, let me start with you. This debate about Facebook and what to do, which is blared right here on the Sunday review section this morning, it is incredibly complicated, the idea breaking up Facebook, making them divest Instagram and WhatsApp, et cetera. And yet, the co-founder Chris Hughes is not the only one talking about this. Elizabeth Warren is on the campaign trail promoting the same thing.</p><p>What does it say about our country and about the world that Facebook has so much power that this is actively being debated?</p><p>CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the issue here is that Facebook has absolutely sinned against democracy, against its users. It's done a lot of bad things. It hasn't protected privacy. It's allowed Russian trolls and other adversaries to run loose and to manipulate its users.</p><p>But it's not clear to me that this particular prescription is actually going to do a lot to solve that problem. I don't really understand how forcing Facebook for example to divest from WhatsApp is going to do anything to rein in the Russian trolls.</p><p>STELTER: I see.</p><p>RAMPELL: Facebook has had three years now since the 2016 election when they essentially advocated the responsibility that they have deliberately or not developed in terms of shaping our discourse and it's not clear that they really have a plan for protecting democracy or at least not letting democracy to get distorted for 2020. I think that's really the question for Facebook. Why are they waiting for regulators to step in and help them do their job or tell them how to do their job. Whether or not that involves an anti trust solution is a separate issue.</p><p>STELTER: Well, I think we worked out the kinks. So, let's ask those questions to Nick Clegg. Let's see if we can get him on now from Palo Alto.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here.</p><p>NICK CLEGG, VICE PRESIDENT FOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS, FACEBOOK: Yes, good to see you. Sorry, it quite ironic. From Silicon Valley, we had some tech problems with the microphone but I think it's working now.</p><p>STELTER: You know, I'm grateful you're here. It's your first television interview in your new role of running comms and public affairs for Facebook.</p><p>CLEGG: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: Obviously, you disagree with Chris Hughes. You don't want Facebook broken up. But why is he wrong, specifically?</p><p>CLEGG: I don't think dismantling companies is the way to deal with some of the complex issues which he quite rightly highlighted, data use, privacy, the attempt by folk from elsewhere to try and interfere in our elections. These are -- I don't in any way want to diminish the importance of those and heavy responsibility that Facebook bares to play a prominent role in solving those problems.</p><p>But chopping a great American success story into bits is not something that's going to make those problems go away. They won't suddenly evaporate. There were still be Russian --</p><p>STELTER: Then what do you propose instead? Then what is going to be done instead?</p><p>CLEGG: Well, first, of course, Facebook needs to do more. And we are -- we are confident that we're going to be considerably better prepared for instance for the 2020 U.S. elections than we were for 2016.</p><p>[11:05:03] And actually, just recently, some independent academics from a network of universities, Princeton, Michigan, and elsewhere, have said that misinformation in our platforms has plummeted by 75 percent, the extent of it compared to 2016. And we need to do more.</p><p>And, of course, we need to do more on a whole range of other fronts, whether it is providing greater reassurance to people that data is kept securely and safe on Facebook platforms to guarantee people's privacy where they rightly are entitled to expect that. So, of course, Facebook is and continues and must continue to do more.</p><p>But equally, this is not something that any company can do on its own. We're dealing with some very profound ethical and political issues. We do also need regulators, politicians and legislatures to -- how can I put it -- sort of move beyond the sort of phase of just throwing rocks at each other or where politicians throw rocks at tech and tech throws rocks back. I'm actually trying to sit down and come up with new rules of the Internet.</p><p>The Internet is a relatively recent phenomenon. Companies like Facebook are still very young, only 15 years old. They have experienced explosive growth around the world. Yes, they encountered a number of challenges, problems, issues, have made mistakes in the past which are self-inflicted, but I don't think anyone could reasonably expect that any single company can come up with all the answers on it own.</p><p>This is something that we need to do in partnership with regulators and lawmakers, not just in D.C. but around the world.</p><p>STELTER: So, you're saying there are problems. You just disagree with Chris Hughes' problem how to solve them. Back In 2017 when you were a British lawmaker, leading a partner over there, you wrote about antitrust. You said, I'm quoting here, as an old fashion liberal who believes in the virtues of competition, I remain perplexed that the way U.S. competition law only seems to clear about the effect of near monopoly market dominance by a tiny number of big players if and when it increases the prices paid by consumers.</p><p>Now, of course, Facebook is a free product, but it sure has all the feel of a monopoly.</p><p>Have you changed your views in the past two years?</p><p>CLEGG: No, I haven't changed my views. I just don't think that Facebook can reasonably be described by anyone as a monopoly. It faces ferocious competition from -- everyone from YouTube to iMessage, from Snapchat to Pinterest. I mean, there is a range of different apps and platforms that you can use if you want to share videos, photos, if you want to message each other.</p><p>So, I don't think -- I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER: But almost no one in the scale of Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>CLEGG: Well --</p><p>STELTER: Almost no one with that scale and you buy up the companies that might have that scale.</p><p>CLEGG: Well, let's remember when Facebook bought up WhatsApp and Instagram, they were considerably smaller than they are now.</p><p>STELTER: True.</p><p>CLEGG: I think it would be a rather odd message to send to American business that when they grow businesses and ever make them ever more successful, and allow millions, indeed, billions of consumers to use for instance, WhatsApp for free, which it wasn't when it was bought up by Facebook, that somehow it should be penalized for that success.</p><p>I don't think -- in the eyes of non American, it's a very American tradition to start penalizing success. That is not -- that is not what antitrust law is used for. I don't believe Facebook is a monopoly.</p><p>And, by the way, on the key sort f engine room by which Facebook makes money, which is on the digital advertising market, I think the latest estimate suggest we have about a 20 percent share of that market here in the United States. Some of our competitors have a far, far larger share than that.</p><p>STELTER: Google.</p><p>CLEGG: So, it seems to be -- yes, sure. But not just Google. We compete with Goggle, we compete with Amazon and many of these companies, by the way, are considerably bigger than Facebook.</p><p>I don't think anyone would think it's logical to say just because you don't particularly like I think in Chris Hughes' case, he doesn't like Mark Zuckerberg's management style, or he doesn't like the leadership of the company, you're going to take a sledgehammer to sort of crack a nut and say, well, therefore, we're going to dismantle it all together.</p><p>And one thing I can tell you is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER: I think he is saying this because of the poison, the amount of poison that is spread on Facebook and WhatsApp, not just in the U.S. but around the world, and elections in India and Brazil and elsewhere. The problem is the poison that we're all choking on, and I know that Facebook didn't invent it, but it exists every day on Facebook.</p><p>CLEGG: Sure. But does anyone seriously think that poison or that attempt to influence elections, unpleasant, hateful, violent content is going to suddenly go away because Facebook has been broken up? In many ways, you could -- you can make the argument, I certainly would make the argument because we have considerably resources to apply to the problem -- so, for instance, Facebook's artificial intelligence tools used to increasingly block hateful material before anyone sees it, over 99 percent of ISIS and Daesh, terrorist-related material is blocked before any human being sees it.</p><p>We also are allowed -- we're also able to provide those tools to Instagram. You wouldn't be able to do that in the future. We spend this year, we will spend this year as a company more in making our platforms as safe and secure as we can and, yes, it's a constant battle.</p><p>[11:10:06] It's a constant battle. We're not going to pretend we're going to be able to, you know, find everything before folks see it and, of course, we need people to help us, to report material, which we can then either downgrade or take down.</p><p>But we will be spending more this year alone on those kind of efforts than the total revenues of Facebook when it was publicly floated earlier in a decade, all of that would be harder if we were to instead -- I don't know -- spend a decade in the courts deciding about whether Facebook should be broken up or not.</p><p>STELTER: It sometimes seems like reporters are the ones finding examples of misinformation and other toxicity on your platform. CNN Business this week, for example, wrote about Instagram and how the #vaccineskill was showing up prominently when you type in the word vaccines. After that CNN story, Instagram blocked the hashtag.</p><p>This seems like a really complicated situation, a situation where journalists are doing heavy lifting for you. Is that a fair assessment? Is that how the way it should work? CLEGG: Well, I certainly think we of course are under a duty and obligation not just journalist, when members of the public or anybody, and they can do it, of course, on the apps themselves, report material they don't think should be on the platforms. We then respond.</p><p>So, yes, of course, we react. But interestingly, what we're trying to do as a sort of general strategy is move from being reactive, which of course was certainly the origins in the way we tackle the lose of this unacceptable material and become more proactive. I gave you that example of a terrorist-related, ISIS-related content earlier.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>CLEGG: But we've just -- we've just announced for instance that our latest -- and we produced these transparency reports every six months where we tell the world how we'll we're doing or badly we're doing in blocking or identifying unacceptable content.</p><p>And on hate speech, which, of course, is much more complicated than terrorist-related content because one person's hate speech is another person's freedom of expression. But on hate speech, our proactive systems and our identifying close to 65 percent of hate speech material before anyone sees it, which is up from 24 percent about a year ago. So, we're getting better. Yes, we need, of course, the cooperation of other folk to be able to report material to us.</p><p>There is so much volume. The volume, of course, that we're dealing with is enormous. Over 100 billion messages are communicated across our platforms. That's just messages every day.</p><p>So I think we're getting better. I think we do of course need to cooperate with others. We do need new rules of the road, but I don't think it would be sensible for anyone, obviously, not for Facebook's point of view, but actually not for society's point of view as a whole if instead we were going to start dismantling the company all together and as Chris Hughes argued -- and tell you, folk in Europe, Mark Zuckerberg was in Paris just on Thursday and Friday talking to regulators there and to President Macron, and I strongly suspect folk in China well, we're looking dismayed at the idea that American decision makers want to break up successful American companies.</p><p>It's oddly enough, only a debate which is being sort of lead here, not in other jurisdictions.</p><p>STELTER: Well, this is about costs and benefits, and we just need to reduce -- all of us collectively need to reduce the costs of these platforms and raise the benefits.</p><p>CLEGG: Yes, totally.</p><p>STELTER: You used to be a deputy prime minister of the U.K. Why did you decide to join Facebook now?</p><p>CLEGG: Because I think there is debate about the kind of -- the frontier, if I could put it like that between tech and society at large, our democracy, our privacy and so on is one of the most important, one of the most fraught, yes, one of the most difficult and controversial debates around. So when I was asked by Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg whether I wanted to join them not just on the communication side of things but I also run Facebook's policies.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>CLEGG: You know, for me, of course, that is a fantastic opportunity to play, I hope, a helpful role in ensuring that Facebook plays in turn a responsible role in this evolving debate, because, look, the way that the rules of the Internet are drawn today in my view or rather not drawn will be quite different to the way they are drawn in 10 years time.</p><p>And I think big tech companies have a choice. Either they play ball and they try and play a responsible role in that debate or they try and duck it all together. And the moment that I heard from Mark Zuckerberg that he wants Facebook to play an active and responsible role in helping to forge partnerships with regulations and governments around the world so that we get these rules right for the future and for future generations and, of course, for me that is a very interesting, interesting challenge.</p><p>STELTER: Nick, thanks so much for coming on. Please come back soon.</p><p>CLEGG: Thank you.</p><p>STELTER: Maybe we'll do it over Facebook Live next time.</p><p>CLEGG: OK. Thank you, thank you.</p><p>STELTER: When we come back, the panel is back with me in just a moment.</p><p>[11:18:22] STELTER: Hey, welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES. I'm Brian Stelter.</p><p>Democracy in the United States is being tested. Every day brings new headlines about more subpoenas and more legal spats and more stonewalling. Democrats say we're in a constitutional crisis. And I just keep asking myself how are news consumers and how are citizens supposed to make sense of this?</p><p>Now, the panel is back here with me now, Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizer and Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, if I had to have you summarize this week in all of these dramatic developments in a headline, in a one-sentence headline, what would it be?</p><p>RAMPELL: I would say the frog has been boiled.</p><p>STELTER: Really?</p><p>RAMPELL: Yes. STELTER: We're at that point now?</p><p>RAMPELL: Yes. You know, I'm referring to if you put a progress in a pot of water and you slowly raise the temperature, the frog won't jump out, right, because they don't get they are about to be boiled.</p><p>Look, I think that the public is basically become inured to the idea that Trump is just going to break norms, break laws, violate the Constitution, violate pretty clear statutes and that's just Trump being Trump, you know? It not a threat to democracy, that there is no constitutional crisis, that it's all outrage and blends together and it's drama playing out.</p><p>STELTER: The situation you're describing is kind of scary, though.</p><p>RAMPELL: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>STELTER: Jess, you laughed at the idea of the frog. I think laughing in agreement. What would your headline be?</p><p>JESS MCINTOSH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Trump is banking that you can't keep up. I think the headline from this week is that there were too many headlines and he's, he is absolutely putting all of his faith in the fact that the American people do not have time to follow all the twists and turns of mechanizations of what he's trying to hide, the things he's stone walling on, the pieces of information he's refusing to give up after being legally compelled to do so.</p><p>[11:20:05] People are busy. They have jobs and lives and families. They're not able to follow a 24-hour -- I'm hardly able to follow a 24-hour news cycle.</p><p>STELTER: But you're coming to this as a liberal commentator, what do you want the press to do differently?</p><p>MCINTOSH: What I really want is to put pressure on the Republican Party at this point. The only reason why we're in a constitutional crisis, the framers actually saw the chance that we might have a president who refused to compile by the rule of law. What they didn't see was that the entire political party who got him there would be engaged in helping them undermine our own democracy.</p><p>At some point, we have to ask Republicans how much they are willing to sacrifice in the future principles in order to let this guy run away with everything.</p><p>STELTER: Julian, your headline this week, it's in \"The Washington Post\". It's in today's paper. It says Democrats are complicit if they don't impeach Trump. The headline print is, it's time for impeachment.</p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Sure, I think we are at a moment of impeachment proceedings. My headline would be --</p><p>STELTER: But we're not actually there in Washington.</p><p>ZELIZER: Well, that would be the headline, time for Congress to act.</p><p>I don't think we can depend on the public to sort through everything. That is why we have a House of Representatives. I think the Mueller report changed the dynamics in terms of putting a pretty troubling picture out there for the public.</p><p>And just as important, this blanket stone wall that we have seen since the release of the report is unprecedented, in terms of using presidential power. So now the Republicans are, they are complicit in letting this just go. But House Democrats do have the authority and they have to make a decision, do we start an impeachment process and that's on the table.</p><p>STELTER: And there's all this debate about the trade war, as well.</p><p>Catherine, you wrote a column this week titled, Trump's -- it's hot air and debt, that's what he's used over the years, over the decades really. Hot air and debt.</p><p>RAMPELL: I think what we have seen is that while many of us, including myself, used to say, oh, well, Trump says he's going to run government like a business. There is no relevance between managing a major company and managing the federal government.</p><p>In fact, he's used a lot of same business practices that succeeded in his business and applied them to the presidency which helped him and hurt the rest of us, including the idea that, you know, he treats the tax code, the law, the Constitution, as just an opening offer and then he uses the threat of unending litigation, of exhausting litigation, to basically get the other side, the side that has the law or the Constitution or tax code or legally binding contract or what-have-you on its side to get them to cede ground.</p><p>And I think that's a lesson he took from his business. That's the lesson he's applying to the presidency. He's done it with other things from his business, as well.</p><p>I mean, the headline refers to, you know, a lot of the debt he ran up within his company, but also the debt that he's run up within the United States. He's kind of engaged in the same pump and dump policy economic style that the \"New York Times\" reported he engaged in in his private business.</p><p>So, that's what I think we're seeing here. That a lot of this sort of unsavory aspects of trickery that helped him do well in a private company he's using for ill.</p><p>STELTER: We need to see it for what it is. When it comes to the hot air and constant tweets, see it for what it is.</p><p>Let me turn to something you did this week on Capitol Hill, kind of interesting. We broke this on CNN.com earlier about Fox trying to get more Democrats on the air and more importantly, Democrats trying to get on Fox. Democrats in the House of Representatives went to a training session called \"Winning on Fox News\".</p><p>And you were one of the teachers? Is that right word, Jess?</p><p>MCINTOSH: One of the media trainers, yes.</p><p>STELTER: What did you -- what did you share?</p><p>MCINTOSH: So, I think there is a necessary debate happening in the Democratic Party about whether or not it is appropriate to lend legitimacy to Fox News. Myself, I stopped appearing on Fox News a few months before.</p><p>STELTER: Even before you joined CNN --</p><p>MCINTOSH: Even before I joined CNN, I made the decision that was not something I wanted to participate in as a Democratic strategist. I simply didn't want to help the propaganda arm of the Republican Party.</p><p>But when you're an elected official, the calculation is different. You have to represent people who might never vote for you, who might never share your views, and one of the only ways to get out of this morass that we're in right now as a country is by showing folks that there are people there to do the right thing, who are there to accomplish something for the people who sent them there. I think that's where the elected officials were coming from.</p><p>They -- generally, they were excited to reach this market share. There are tons of Fox viewers and not all reliable Republican voters. Some of them are -- they want to hear from Democrats in a way that isn't tainted by the opinion folks over at Fox. So I think those elected officials are excited about reaching those folks and let them know there is more to what Democrats are doing on the Hill than what they are going to hear from that particular media outlet.</p><p>STELTER: From prime time, especially.</p><p>MCINTOSH: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: To the panel, thank you so much.</p><p>Quick break here, and two more exclusive interviews. \"The Intercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed is standing by. She's here to react to another arrest of another person charged with leaking government secrets to her website.</p><p>[11:25:03] And later, Chelsea Manning, her first interview since he was released from prison last week. Stick around. We'll be right back.</p><p>STELTER: Welcome back.</p><p>This week, we got word that a former intelligence analyst named Daniel Hale has been hit with charges for leaking classified documents to a reporter back in 2014. He's been arrested. He's now facing charges.</p><p>The indictment doesn't name the reporter or the outlet in question, but it's pretty clear the recipients of this alleged leak were Jeremy Scahill and \"The Intercept\" website. The site came out with drone papers back in 2015. This was a really important investigation with information about Obama's drone wars.</p><p>Hale is the fifth federal employee to be charged with leaking sensitive information during the Trump administration's years. This is an on going escalation of what the Obama administration was doing for the eight years Obama was in office.</p><p>Let me bring in \"The Intercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed. She's here with me now in New York.</p><p>Betsey, thanks for coming over. Happy Mother's Day.</p><p>: Thank you, Brian.</p><p>STELTER: I wish this was under better circumstances.</p><p>We now know of three cases where there are people accused of leaking it seems to \"The Intercept\". What do you see going on within the Department of Justice as they prosecute these alleged leakers?</p><p>BETSY REED, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE INTERCEPT: Like all journalism organizations, we do not speak about our anonymous sources, so I can't comment any specifically about any of these cases. But what I can say is that this is part of an escalation of the war on whistle-blowers that was launched really in earnest during the Obama administration that prosecuted eight journalistic sources under the Espionage Act.</p><p>[11:30:00] That is a 1919 statute that was actually designed for traitors and spies, and it was applied against people who were really stepping up to publicize information they thought was important for Americans to know. And what we've seen under Trump is an escalation of this very practice.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR: You call them whistleblower, the other would say traitors. What do you think viewers should know about the kind of information that these government officials are allegedly providing to reporters?</p><p>REED: I think it's frankly preposterous to use the concept of traitor to describe someone who's brought into the public domain information about how the government is spying on its own citizens, how the government is carry on wars around the world in secret and not allowing the public to engage in substantive debate about the fact that there are unconstitutional processes going on that it results in the killing of American citizens abroad.</p><p>STELTER: The idea that we deserve more information not less especially about America's wars is something that I think we should all be able to agree on but it becomes this just issue about the sources, deciding to commit a crime by leaking documents. That's what the department justice is getting these individuals on.</p><p>What do you -- what do you say to people who worry about source protection given that it seems like three of these investigations involves people that leaked to your Web site? Are you all doing enough to protect them?</p><p>REED: Well we like other journalism organizations are doing our best to deploy you know strategies like using encryption and other technologies that are digital security specialists help us with. But you know, it's a risky business inherently doing national security reporting. Everybody on the beat knows that and they're knowing it increasingly now because one of the things that we've reported a lot on is surveillance, right, that the way that the government surveillance ordinary citizens.</p><p>But in fact, when it comes to their own employees and contractors, that surveillance is you know, exponentially more powerful. And so they know everything their employees and contractors do. They know what Web sites they're reading. They know who's printed which document. And so it is risky. And we try to be quite upfront with potential sources about what risks are entailed.</p><p>The fact is that deciding to become a whistleblower is a really momentous decision that takes a lot of courage and does entail risk that can be mitigated but it can't be completely eradicated.</p><p>STELTER: That's a challenge, an ongoing challenge. Meantime, it seems like there was more of a chill in the air because of all these (INAUDIBLE), a challenge for your newsroom and for others.</p><p>REED: Absolutely. The Committee to Protect Journalists recently did a story that was about interviews with a number of national security journalists from the New York Times and other institutions and they all said that there's a chill among their sources, that people are increasingly afraid of coming forward with important information.</p><p>And information like you know, we learned from the Pentagon papers, from the COINTELPRO documents in the 1970s that provoked really important debates about the Vietnam War and about the FBI's unconstitutional spying on Americans.</p><p>These are the kinds of stories that the government does not want Americans to know about and they will do everything in their power to stop it from coming out, which is why the work that national security journalists do is critically important and why every journalist should be concerned about prosecutions of journalistic, alleged journalistic sources.</p><p>STELTER: Betsy, thanks for being here. Great to see you.</p><p>REED: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>STELTER: Thank you. A related story actually coming up next about someone who was arrested for leaking almost a decade ago. Now Chelsea Manning is facing jail time for a different reason. She will join me live right after this.</p><p>[11:35:00] STELTER: Chelsea Manning was in prison for seven years after leaking military and diplomatic secrets to WikiLeaks in 2010. She was facing up to 28 more years in prison when her sentence was commuted by President Obama in 2017. But two months ago, she was back behind bars for refusing to testify to a grand jury in Virginia.</p><p>Prosecutors apparently wanted her to tell all about her contacts with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Manning refused and said she already told everything years ago and the judge held her in contempt. Three days ago she was released because that particular grand jury was finished. But now she's facing another subpoena in just a few days and possibly more jail time.</p><p>Chelsea Manning's joining me now here in New York. Thank you for coming in.</p><p>CHELSEA MANNING, FORMER INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, U.S. ARMY: Hey, thanks for having me.</p><p>STELTER: What is going on with these grand juries? What do they want to know about Julian Assange from you?</p><p>MANNING: Well, first off, nobody's actually -- and none of this has any single person been specifically identified. What they've asked me questions about specifically are my conduct and how I did things which I all -- which I methodically laid out in you know, hours of testimony and a 40-page statement.</p><p>So they're really just trying to go through the same procedural you know, the same -- the procedure of how things happened again. And I think that --</p><p>STELTER: They just want you to describe the same things again?</p><p>MANNING: Yes, what they want to do. So --</p><p>STELTER: But it does seem like it's intended to be able to punish Assange further, right? We already know he's been charged -- the government seems to want to charge him with more counts and it seems that they want information from you for that. Is that your impression?</p><p>MANNING: I mean, I'm -- I think that's certainly my impression. But I think that what's interesting here is that the process of a grand jury is to obtain indictments. We already have an indictment, so why are we going through this process. And I think that the kinds of questions that I've been asked are about disclosures and how the things are disclosed and why they're disclosed as opposed to like the how it was obtained.</p><p>They're -- they don't seem to be interested in how the -- and you know, there's an enormous amount of computer forensics in this case. Like this is -- they don't need me to like do a case on like how it happened. They have that. What they're really interested in is what my intentions were which I laid out in the testimony. How -- you know what my impressions of how that would look like would be and you know, like what -- you know how much of that would be published. I think that's more of their interest. STELTER: And this was nine years ago that you were providing this information to Julian Assange. Some of it was cited as evidence of war crimes by the American government -- by the American military. This is still going off for you now nine years later. Do you have any regrets?</p><p>MANNING: Well, first off, I just want to point out that I don't actually know who I'm communicating with. I certainly have suspicions. I certainly have suspicions and I believe I've laid out like you know, I've laid out the -- in my testimony I said like you know, like sure, there's like percentage ranges as to like who it could be, but I don't actually know who's on the other end of the of these communications.</p><p>STELTER: OK.</p><p>MANNING: You know, so you know, the chat logs that you see, the indictment, which were in the court-martial record you know, we've already gone over this. You know, I've said as much as I can say about that. Now then, as to whether it -- I have any regrets you know, like I -- it's -- I don't relitigate things.</p><p>Like I did what I did with the information that I had, the knowledge that I had, and the tools and resources I had at the time. The simple fact of the matter is that in 2010 -- you know, in 2010 when all this -- you know, all this happen it was very different you know, landscape. You know, they -- even just trying to -- like I reached out to the New York Times and The Washington Post.</p><p>I reached out to the Washington Post first because I actually seen all the presidents meant so you know, so it was just this technological barrier, you know, the lack of encryption tools, the lack of knowledge about -- on the part of reporters about how to protect -- you know, how to -- about how to communicate and verify this kind of information.</p><p>[11:40:48] STELTER: But WikiLeaks did know how. Do you view the prosecution of Assange as a threat to press freedom?</p><p>MANNING: I mean, I think that -- I think that the Eastern District of Virginia is now turning into a rubber stamp for all these different prosecutions that really are going after you know -- and I think that ultimately what they really want is they want to go after journalists.</p><p>Like the-- like the -- this administration clearly wants to go after journalists. I think that if the administration gets its way as its laid out you know, in repeated statements like the media is the enemy of the people kind of thing, you know -- you know, then I think that we're going to see that you know national security journalists and you know a lot of -- a lot of disruptive you know, for this administration press. We're probably going to see you know indictments and charges, you know, but perhaps indirectly related.</p><p>And the average American commits -- you know, there's so many of federal offenses. The average American commits three felonies a day. So whenever journalism it makes a misstep, I think that they're put on notice now that the FBI and the Department of Justice are going to go after them on the administration's behalf.</p><p>STELTER: And what about you? You're due back on Thursday.</p><p>MANNING: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: Another subpoena for another grand jury.</p><p>MANNING: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: What's going to happen?</p><p>MANNING: Well, if they're asking this -- they want -- they've already stipulated they want to ask the same questions. So this is not about -- this is not about anything new. They're not even asking anything -- they're not even asking anything new. I've already laid all of this out.</p><p>STELTER: So you're going to refuse again.</p><p>MANNING: I am going to refuse. I don't -- I think that this grand jury is an -- I mean, I think that all grand juries are improper. I don't like the secrecy of it. One of the reasons why the -- why we had so much -- why there was so much secrecy and speculation and like so much like ham hand-wringing over the Mueller report was because of the secrecy.</p><p>We would know -- we would know far more if we would just have public hearings, bring the stuff out there and like you know -- and I did. I testified you know, before an open court with all these journalists there. Like I have nothing new to provide.</p><p>STELTER: But they want to hear from you again. That's the law. Will you be back in jail next weekend?</p><p>MANNING: Well, I'd be -- it's going to depend on -- we certainly have a motion to quash. We're certainly going to raise every single legal challenge. We have -- we have very -- you know, we have a very strong case. We had a strong case previously but now we have additional evidence as to what our case is.</p><p>STELTER: So it's up in the air. We don't know if you'll be sentenced to jail or not again.</p><p>MANNING: We don't. But you know, I think that we have a much stronger case in terms of like the legal objections which you know, the previous judge didn't -- he refused to even hear. He refused to even hear them or act on the motions. He just simply placed me in contempt and ignored our motions.</p><p>STELTER: We talk all the time about unprincipled politicians and what you're doing is an act of principle whether viewers agree with it or not, I can see that. Chelsea thanks for being here.</p><p>MANNING: Thank you. STELTER: Great talking with you. A quick break here and when we come back, Carl Bernstein talking about all the week's news trying to put it all together. We'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>[11:45:00] STELTER: So many Trump-related storylines are converging all of them convoluted but many pointing in the same direction toward presidential abuses of power. So are members of the media living up to this challenge? Let's ask Carl Bernstein. He's here with me in New York. Carl, that's the question. Are we living up to this moment in history?</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, by we if you mean the press, I think -- I think yes. Our institutions, so far the answer is, not hardly.</p><p>STELTER: You mean the Congress?</p><p>BERNSTEIN: Well, the Congress of the United States particularly because there has been no real bipartisan investigation of the most authoritarian president in our history, probably. And let's go back to basics here that we find ourselves in this situation right now because there is an ongoing cover-up by the President of the United States.</p><p>Whether that constitutes a violation of law, whether he is a criminal or not, that's for down the road. But right now it's obvious to anyone who watches, anyone who looks at the facts, reads the Mueller Report, the obstruction part, particularly, we are in the midst of a continuing cover-up by the president aided and abetted by the Attorney General of the United States.</p><p>Trump said he wanted his Roy Cohn. He's got him now in the Attorney General. And where this is taking us is to an unprecedented place. It's not about a constitutional crisis, this is a systemic crisis challenging whether our institutions are able to function in this country to deal with a president of the United States who is unique in our history, who has nothing but contempt for democratic tradition and the rule of law.</p><p>So really where the rubber is going to meet the road is going to be the Supreme Court of the United States. And Chief Justice Roberts has got his table being set for him in a way that may have an awful lot to do with the future of American democracy.</p><p>STELTER: You say systemic crisis though. I think I hear his fan saying Trump just being a tough guy. He's just holding on to his power. That's what every president would do. They would say he's not so different from the past presidents.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: Well, he's very different from past presidents.</p><p>STELTER But I feel like Fox News viewers are fed about this narrative about Obama and other Democrats and make them all the same. BERNSTEIN: Look, we can't -- we can't do anything about Fox News and what they feed their audience anymore. What we need to do in the press is to continue our reporting. There is wide open area for reporting. Look what the Wall Street Journal owned by the same person who owns Fox News -- Fox News Rupert Murdoch reported last week about McGahn stiffing the President of the United States and saying he would not go and tell the Congress of the United States and others that the President had not obstructed justice, refused to do it. Who produced that story?</p><p>STELTER: The Murdochs. That's a great point</p><p>BERNSTEIN: The Murdoch press. So let's continue to do what we do best. You know, look at the tax story that the New York Times did showing us that we have a grifter president of the United States, a tax cheat, someone who is a fraud in business which is demonstrable which you've had his biographers who say the same thing, and now we are seeing the fraudulence through what the press is reporting today.</p><p>We need to be looking at the relationship of the Trump business organization with Russia and Russians and ethno Russians. There's plenty of room for original reporting. And incidentally, if this story were to go in some direction, that by some miracle exonerated President Trump, so be it.</p><p>[11:50:35] STELTER: That would be a good thing for the country.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: But so far -- so far all the evidence particularly the Mueller report is so overwhelming. And also, this is no exoneration about his conduct in terms of Russia and Russian contacts. That's not what the Mueller report says.</p><p>STELTER: The Mueller report, let's talk more about that Mueller report in just a moment. We'll be right back more with Carl in just a moment here on RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>STELTER: Carl Bernstein is back with me here. And Carl, I just want to note, the Mueller report has stayed in power. Look at this, number one and two on the New York Times bestseller list this week. Pretty impressive for a free you know, free PDF. All this talk about Robert Mueller testifying, when will he -- will it happen, how important is it we hear from Mueller on television?</p><p>BERNSTEIN: I think -- well, I think it's essential, whether he testifies before the committee or whether he chooses another venue. If the president claims executive privilege before that body, perhaps there's another venue that Mueller might choose, such as going on television himself or members of his staff in such a way that they don't reveal perhaps information that shouldn't be revealed for reasons of grand jury secrecy at the moment and at the same time, tell the story about what this investigation was about and what it really found.</p><p>We need to hear from that investigation, those who conducted the investigation and we also need the full report. It is essential that the American people have the full report through their representatives in Congress, every word of it. And there's one other thing we can't forget. There is an ongoing national security, counterintelligence investigation that was not part of the Mueller report that is ongoing.</p><p>There is much more that is going to be learned I think we can say with some absolute foreknowledge about what happened with Russians and what happened with the Trump campaign and people around him. But this idea of the President getting up and claiming some kind of complete exoneration, I think it's necessary perhaps on some of our times on the air, maybe we ought to read out loud and put up exactly what the report said about that. It did not say we exonerate the president.</p><p>[11:55:46] STELTER: Right. When Mitch McConnell says case closed, we should show that the case is open. Carl, thanks for being here. Great to see you.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: Great to be here.</p><p>STELTER: I appreciate it.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: Thanks.</p><p>STELTER: Happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching, especially my wife, my mom, my mother-in-law.

HappyMother's Day and welcome to RELIABLE SOURCES from CNN's brand-newstudio here in New York City.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's what we have coming up for you this hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chelsea Manning is out of jail but facing another subpoena, whichmeans she may be back in jail in just a few days.  In the meantime,she's here to join me live for an exclusive interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, something many know a lot about, leak hunts.  Another federalemployee stands accused of slipping classified information to \"TheIntercept\" website.  \"The Intercept's\" top editor will join me live toreact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And later, to Fox or not to Fox.  That's the question for Democrats.I'll speak with one of the people who was on Capitol Hill this weekteaching lawmakers about how to appear on Fox News.  What a job.</p><p>But first, today, the Facebook debate.  Everybody has an opinion aboutFacebook.  The company's actions and inactions have huge consequencesfor politics, business and news media.</p><p>And Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is coming out swinging with thisop-ed in \"The New York Times\", declaring that the social network hasbecome dangerous.  He says Mark Zuckerberg's power is unprecedentedand un-American, and he says the government must intervene by breakingup Facebook and enforcing new regulations.</p><p>Hughes dropped this op-ed on Thursday morning, then hopped on NPR,NBC, CNN, and he just appeared minutes ago on \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS.\"</p><p>And right now, Facebook is responding.</p><p>Nick Clegg is the company's new vice president for global affairs andcommunications and this is his first television interview.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here with me.</p><p>I think maybe we're having a little trouble with Nick.  Let see if wecan get him on.</p><p>All right.  Little bit of trouble.  What's that?</p><p>All right.  A little bit of trouble here with the new set.  That's OK.We're making a big move.  We're going to get to Nick in a coupleminutes.</p><p>In the meantime, while we work on that, let me bring in our panel.We've got an all-star panel.  It's already.  We're wired up and on setwith us.</p><p>Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizer and Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, a little bit surprise here but if you don't mind, let mestart with you.  This debate about Facebook and what to do, which isblared right here on the Sunday review section this morning, it isincredibly complicated, the idea breaking up Facebook, making themdivest Instagram and WhatsApp, et cetera.  And yet, the co-founderChris Hughes is not the only one talking about this.  Elizabeth Warrenis on the campaign trail promoting the same thing.</p><p>What does it say about our country and about the world that Facebookhas so much power that this is actively being debated?</p><p>CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think the issuehere is that Facebook has absolutely sinned against democracy, againstits users.  It's done a lot of bad things.  It hasn't protectedprivacy.  It's allowed Russian trolls and other adversaries to runloose and to manipulate its users.</p><p>But it's not clear to me that this particular prescription is actuallygoing to do a lot to solve that problem.  I don't really understandhow forcing Facebook for example to divest from WhatsApp is going todo anything to rein in the Russian trolls.</p><p>STELTER:  I see.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Facebook has had three years now since the 2016 electionwhen they essentially advocated the responsibility that they havedeliberately or not developed in terms of shaping our discourse andit's not clear that they really have a plan for protecting democracyor at least not letting democracy to get distorted for 2020.  I thinkthat's really the question for Facebook.  Why are they waiting forregulators to step in and help them do their job or tell them how todo their job.  Whether or not that involves an anti trust solution isa separate issue.</p><p>STELTER:  Well, I think we worked out the kinks.  So, let's ask thosequestions to Nick Clegg.  Let's see if we can get him on now from PaloAlto.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here.</p><p>NICK CLEGG, VICE PRESIDENT FOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS,FACEBOOK:  Yes, good to see you.  Sorry, it quite ironic.  FromSilicon Valley, we had some tech problems with the microphone but Ithink it's working now.</p><p>STELTER:  You know, I'm grateful you're here.  It's your firsttelevision interview in your new role of running comms and publicaffairs for Facebook.</p><p>CLEGG:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  Obviously, you disagree with Chris Hughes.  You don't wantFacebook broken up.  But why is he wrong, specifically?</p><p>CLEGG:  I don't think dismantling companies is the way to deal withsome of the complex issues which he quite rightly highlighted, datause, privacy, the attempt by folk from elsewhere to try and interferein our elections.  These are -- I don't in any way want to diminishthe importance of those and heavy responsibility that Facebook baresto play a prominent role in solving those problems.</p><p>But chopping a great American success story into bits is not somethingthat's going to make those problems go away.  They won't suddenlyevaporate.  There were still be Russian --</p><p>STELTER:  Then what do you propose instead?  Then what is going to bedone instead?</p><p>CLEGG:  Well, first, of course, Facebook needs to do more.  And we are-- we are confident that we're going to be considerably betterprepared for instance for the 2020 U.S. elections than we were for2016.</p><p>[11:05:03] And actually, just recently, some independent academicsfrom a network of universities, Princeton, Michigan, and elsewhere,have said that misinformation in our platforms has plummeted by 75percent, the extent of it compared to 2016.  And we need to do more.</p><p>And, of course, we need to do more on a whole range of other fronts,whether it is providing greater reassurance to people that data iskept securely and safe on Facebook platforms to guarantee people'sprivacy where they rightly are entitled to expect that.  So, ofcourse, Facebook is and continues and must continue to do more.</p><p>But equally, this is not something that any company can do on its own.We're dealing with some very profound ethical and political issues.We do also need regulators, politicians and legislatures to -- how canI put it -- sort of move beyond the sort of phase of just throwingrocks at each other or where politicians throw rocks at tech and techthrows rocks back.  I'm actually trying to sit down and come up withnew rules of the Internet.</p><p>The Internet is a relatively recent phenomenon.  Companies likeFacebook are still very young, only 15 years old.  They haveexperienced explosive growth around the world.  Yes, they encountereda number of challenges, problems, issues, have made mistakes in thepast which are self-inflicted, but I don't think anyone couldreasonably expect that any single company can come up with all theanswers on it own.</p><p>This is something that we need to do in partnership with regulatorsand lawmakers, not just in D.C. but around the world.</p><p>STELTER:  So, you're saying there are problems.  You just disagreewith Chris Hughes' problem how to solve them.  Back In 2017 when you were a British lawmaker, leading a partner overthere, you wrote about antitrust.  You said, I'm quoting here, as anold fashion liberal who believes in the virtues of competition, Iremain perplexed that the way U.S. competition law only seems to clearabout the effect of near monopoly market dominance by a tiny number ofbig players if and when it increases the prices paid by consumers.</p><p>Now, of course, Facebook is a free product, but it sure has all thefeel of a monopoly.</p><p>Have you changed your views in the past two years?</p><p>CLEGG:  No, I haven't changed my views.  I just don't think thatFacebook can reasonably be described by anyone as a monopoly.  Itfaces ferocious competition from -- everyone from YouTube to iMessage,from Snapchat to Pinterest.  I mean, there is a range of differentapps and platforms that you can use if you want to share videos,photos, if you want to message each other.</p><p>So, I don't think -- I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER:  But almost no one in the scale of Facebook and Instagram andWhatsApp.</p><p>CLEGG:  Well --</p><p>STELTER:  Almost no one with that scale and you buy up the companiesthat might have that scale.</p><p>CLEGG:  Well, let's remember when Facebook bought up WhatsApp andInstagram, they were considerably smaller than they are now.</p><p>STELTER:  True.</p><p>CLEGG:  I think it would be a rather odd message to send to Americanbusiness that when they grow businesses and ever make them ever moresuccessful, and allow millions, indeed, billions of consumers to usefor instance, WhatsApp for free, which it wasn't when it was bought upby Facebook, that somehow it should be penalized for that success.</p><p>I don't think -- in the eyes of non American, it's a very Americantradition to start penalizing success.  That is not -- that is notwhat antitrust law is used for.  I don't believe Facebook is amonopoly.</p><p>And, by the way, on the key sort f engine room by which Facebook makesmoney, which is on the digital advertising market, I think the latestestimate suggest we have about a 20 percent share of that market herein the United States.  Some of our competitors have a far, far largershare than that.</p><p>STELTER:  Google.</p><p>CLEGG:  So, it seems to be -- yes, sure.  But not just Google.  Wecompete with Goggle, we compete with Amazon and many of thesecompanies, by the way, are considerably bigger than Facebook.</p><p>I don't think anyone would think it's logical to say just because youdon't particularly like I think in Chris Hughes' case, he doesn't likeMark Zuckerberg's management style, or he doesn't like the leadershipof the company, you're going to take a sledgehammer to sort of crack anut and say, well, therefore, we're going to dismantle it alltogether.</p><p>And one thing I can tell you is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER:  I think he is saying this because of the poison, the amountof poison that is spread on Facebook and WhatsApp, not just in theU.S. but around the world, and elections in India and Brazil andelsewhere.  The problem is the poison that we're all choking on, and Iknow that Facebook didn't invent it, but it exists every day onFacebook.</p><p>CLEGG:  Sure.  But does anyone seriously think that poison or thatattempt to influence elections, unpleasant, hateful, violent contentis going to suddenly go away because Facebook has been broken up?  Inmany ways, you could -- you can make the argument, I certainly wouldmake the argument because we have considerably resources to apply tothe problem -- so, for instance, Facebook's artificial intelligencetools used to increasingly block hateful material before anyone seesit, over 99 percent of ISIS and Daesh, terrorist-related material isblocked before any human being sees it.</p><p>We also are allowed -- we're also able to provide those tools toInstagram.  You wouldn't be able to do that in the future.  We spendthis year, we will spend this year as a company more in making ourplatforms as safe and secure as we can and, yes, it's a constantbattle.</p><p>[11:10:06] It's a constant battle.  We're not going to pretend we'regoing to be able to, you know, find everything before folks see itand, of course, we need people to help us, to report material, whichwe can then either downgrade or take down.</p><p>But we will be spending more this year alone on those kind of effortsthan the total revenues of Facebook when it was publicly floatedearlier in a decade, all of that would be harder if we were to instead-- I don't know -- spend a decade in the courts deciding about whetherFacebook should be broken up or not.</p><p>STELTER:  It sometimes seems like reporters are the ones findingexamples of misinformation and other toxicity on your platform.  CNNBusiness this week, for example, wrote about Instagram and how the#vaccineskill was showing up prominently when you type in the wordvaccines.  After that CNN story, Instagram blocked the hashtag.</p><p>This seems like a really complicated situation, a situation wherejournalists are doing heavy lifting for you.  Is that a fairassessment?  Is that how the way it should work?  CLEGG:  Well, I certainly think we of course are under a duty andobligation not just journalist, when members of the public or anybody,and they can do it, of course, on the apps themselves, report materialthey don't think should be on the platforms.  We then respond.</p><p>So, yes, of course, we react.  But interestingly, what we're trying todo as a sort of general strategy is move from being reactive, which ofcourse was certainly the origins in the way we tackle the lose of thisunacceptable material and become more proactive.  I gave you thatexample of a terrorist-related, ISIS-related content earlier.</p><p>STELTER:  Right.</p><p>CLEGG:  But we've just -- we've just announced for instance that ourlatest -- and we produced these transparency reports every six monthswhere we tell the world how we'll we're doing or badly we're doing inblocking or identifying unacceptable content.</p><p>And on hate speech, which, of course, is much more complicated thanterrorist-related content because one person's hate speech is anotherperson's freedom of expression.  But on hate speech, our proactivesystems and our identifying close to 65 percent of hate speechmaterial before anyone sees it, which is up from 24 percent about ayear ago.  So, we're getting better.  Yes, we need, of course, thecooperation of other folk to be able to report material to us.</p><p>There is so much volume.  The volume, of course, that we're dealingwith is enormous.  Over 100 billion messages are communicated acrossour platforms.  That's just messages every day.</p><p>So I think we're getting better.  I think we do of course need tocooperate with others.  We do need new rules of the road, but I don'tthink it would be sensible for anyone, obviously, not for Facebook'spoint of view, but actually not for society's point of view as a wholeif instead we were going to start dismantling the company all togetherand as Chris Hughes argued -- and tell you, folk in Europe, MarkZuckerberg was in Paris just on Thursday and Friday talking toregulators there and to President Macron, and I strongly suspect folkin China well, we're looking dismayed at the idea that Americandecision makers want to break up successful American companies.</p><p>It's oddly enough, only a debate which is being sort of lead here, notin other jurisdictions.</p><p>STELTER:  Well, this is about costs and benefits, and we just need toreduce -- all of us collectively need to reduce the costs of theseplatforms and raise the benefits.</p><p>CLEGG:  Yes, totally.</p><p>STELTER:  You used to be a deputy prime minister of the U.K.  Why didyou decide to join Facebook now?</p><p>CLEGG:  Because I think there is debate about the kind of -- thefrontier, if I could put it like that between tech and society atlarge, our democracy, our privacy and so on is one of the mostimportant, one of the most fraught, yes, one of the most difficult andcontroversial debates around.  So when I was asked by Mark Zuckerbergand Sheryl Sandberg whether I wanted to join them not just on thecommunication side of things but I also run Facebook's policies.</p><p>STELTER:  Right.</p><p>CLEGG:  You know, for me, of course, that is a fantastic opportunityto play, I hope, a helpful role in ensuring that Facebook plays inturn a responsible role in this evolving debate, because, look, theway that the rules of the Internet are drawn today in my view orrather not drawn will be quite different to the way they are drawn in10 years time.</p><p>And I think big tech companies have a choice.  Either they play balland they try and play a responsible role in that debate or they tryand duck it all together.  And the moment that I heard from MarkZuckerberg that he wants Facebook to play an active and responsiblerole in helping to forge partnerships with regulations and governmentsaround the world so that we get these rules right for the future andfor future generations and, of course, for me that is a veryinteresting, interesting challenge.</p><p>STELTER:  Nick, thanks so much for coming on.  Please come back soon.</p><p>CLEGG:  Thank you.</p><p>STELTER:  Maybe we'll do it over Facebook Live next time.</p><p>CLEGG:  OK.  Thank you, thank you.</p><p>STELTER:  When we come back, the panel is back with me in just amoment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:18:22] STELTER:  Hey, welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES.  I'm BrianStelter.</p><p>Democracy in the United States is being tested.  Every day brings newheadlines about more subpoenas and more legal spats and morestonewalling.  Democrats say we're in a constitutional crisis.  And Ijust keep asking myself how are news consumers and how are citizenssupposed to make sense of this?</p><p>Now, the panel is back here with me now, Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizerand Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, if I had to have you summarize this week in all of thesedramatic developments in a headline, in a one-sentence headline, whatwould it be?</p><p>RAMPELL:  I would say the frog has been boiled.</p><p>STELTER:  Really?</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.STELTER:  We're at that point now?</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.  You know, I'm referring to if you put a progress in apot of water and you slowly raise the temperature, the frog won't jumpout, right, because they don't get they are about to be boiled.</p><p>Look, I think that the public is basically become inured to the ideathat Trump is just going to break norms, break laws, violate theConstitution, violate pretty clear statutes and that's just Trumpbeing Trump, you know?  It not a threat to democracy, that there is noconstitutional crisis, that it's all outrage and blends together andit's drama playing out.</p><p>STELTER:  The situation you're describing is kind of scary, though.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p>STELTER:  Jess, you laughed at the idea of the frog.  I think laughingin agreement.  What would your headline be?</p><p>JESS MCINTOSH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Trump is banking that youcan't keep up.  I think the headline from this week is that there weretoo many headlines and he's, he is absolutely putting all of his faithin the fact that the American people do not have time to follow allthe twists and turns of mechanizations of what he's trying to hide,the things he's stone walling on, the pieces of information he'srefusing to give up after being legally compelled to do so.</p><p>[11:20:05] People are busy.  They have jobs and lives and families.They're not able to follow a 24-hour -- I'm hardly able to follow a24-hour news cycle.</p><p>STELTER:  But you're coming to this as a liberal commentator, what doyou want the press to do differently?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  What I really want is to put pressure on the RepublicanParty at this point.  The only reason why we're in a constitutionalcrisis, the framers actually saw the chance that we might have apresident who refused to compile by the rule of law.  What they didn'tsee was that the entire political party who got him there would beengaged in helping them undermine our own democracy.</p><p>At some point, we have to ask Republicans how much they are willing tosacrifice in the future principles in order to let this guy run awaywith everything.</p><p>STELTER:  Julian, your headline this week, it's in \"The WashingtonPost\".  It's in today's paper.  It says Democrats are complicit ifthey don't impeach Trump.  The headline print is, it's time forimpeachment.</p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure, I think we are at amoment of impeachment proceedings.  My headline would be --</p><p>STELTER:  But we're not actually there in Washington.</p><p>ZELIZER: Well, that would be the headline, time for Congress to act.</p><p>I don't think we can depend on the public to sort through everything.That is why we have a House of Representatives.  I think the Muellerreport changed the dynamics in terms of putting a pretty troublingpicture out there for the public.</p><p>And just as important, this blanket stone wall that we have seen sincethe release of the report is unprecedented, in terms of usingpresidential power.  So now the Republicans are, they are complicit inletting this just go.  But House Democrats do have the authority andthey have to make a decision, do we start an impeachment process andthat's on the table.</p><p>STELTER:  And there's all this debate about the trade war, as well.</p><p>Catherine, you wrote a column this week titled, Trump's -- it's hotair and debt, that's what he's used over the years, over the decadesreally.  Hot air and debt.</p><p>RAMPELL:  I think what we have seen is that while many of us,including myself, used to say, oh, well, Trump says he's going to rungovernment like a business.  There is no relevance between managing amajor company and managing the federal government.</p><p>In fact, he's used a lot of same business practices that succeeded inhis business and applied them to the presidency which helped him andhurt the rest of us, including the idea that, you know, he treats thetax code, the law, the Constitution, as just an opening offer and thenhe uses the threat of unending litigation, of exhausting litigation,to basically get the other side, the side that has the law or theConstitution or tax code or legally binding contract or what-have-youon its side to get them to cede ground.</p><p>And I think that's a lesson he took from his business.  That's thelesson he's applying to the presidency.  He's done it with otherthings from his business, as well.</p><p>I mean, the headline refers to, you know, a lot of the debt he ran upwithin his company, but also the debt that he's run up within theUnited States.  He's kind of engaged in the same pump and dump policyeconomic style that the \"New York Times\" reported he engaged in in hisprivate business.</p><p>So, that's what I think we're seeing here.  That a lot of this sort ofunsavory aspects of trickery that helped him do well in a privatecompany he's using for ill.</p><p>STELTER:  We need to see it for what it is.  When it comes to the hotair and constant tweets, see it for what it is.</p><p>Let me turn to something you did this week on Capitol Hill, kind ofinteresting.  We broke this on CNN.com earlier about Fox trying to getmore Democrats on the air and more importantly, Democrats trying toget on Fox.  Democrats in the House of Representatives went to atraining session called \"Winning on Fox News\".</p><p>And you were one of the teachers?  Is that right word, Jess?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  One of the media trainers, yes.</p><p>STELTER:  What did you -- what did you share?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  So, I think there is a necessary debate happening in theDemocratic Party about whether or not it is appropriate to lendlegitimacy to Fox News.  Myself, I stopped appearing on Fox News a fewmonths before.</p><p>STELTER:  Even before you joined CNN --</p><p>MCINTOSH:  Even before I joined CNN, I made the decision that was notsomething I wanted to participate in as a Democratic strategist.  Isimply didn't want to help the propaganda arm of the Republican Party.</p><p>But when you're an elected official, the calculation is different.You have to represent people who might never vote for you, who mightnever share your views, and one of the only ways to get out of thismorass that we're in right now as a country is by showing folks thatthere are people there to do the right thing, who are there toaccomplish something for the people who sent them there.  I thinkthat's where the elected officials were coming from.</p><p>They -- generally, they were excited to reach this market share.There are tons of Fox viewers and not all reliable Republican voters.Some of them are -- they want to hear from Democrats in a way thatisn't tainted by the opinion folks over at Fox.  So I think thoseelected officials are excited about reaching those folks and let themknow there is more to what Democrats are doing on the Hill than whatthey are going to hear from that particular media outlet.</p><p>STELTER:  From prime time, especially.</p><p>MCINTOSH:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  To the panel, thank you so much.</p><p>Quick break here, and two more exclusive interviews.  \"TheIntercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed is standing by.  She's here toreact to another arrest of another person charged with leakinggovernment secrets to her website.</p><p>[11:25:03] And later, Chelsea Manning, her first interview since hewas released from prison last week.  Stick around.  We'll be rightback.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STELTER:  Welcome back.</p><p>This week, we got word that a former intelligence analyst named DanielHale has been hit with charges for leaking classified documents to areporter back in 2014.  He's been arrested.  He's now facing charges.</p><p>The indictment doesn't name the reporter or the outlet in question,but it's pretty clear the recipients of this alleged leak were JeremyScahill and \"The Intercept\" website.  The site came out with dronepapers back in 2015.  This was a really important investigation withinformation about Obama's drone wars.</p><p>Hale is the fifth federal employee to be charged with leakingsensitive information during the Trump administration's years.  Thisis an on going escalation of what the Obama administration was doingfor the eight years Obama was in office.</p><p>Let me bring in \"The Intercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed.  She'shere with me now in New York.</p><p>Betsey, thanks for coming over.  Happy Mother's Day.</p><p>:  Thank you, Brian.</p><p>STELTER:  I wish this was under better circumstances.</p><p>We now know of three cases where there are people accused of leakingit seems to \"The Intercept\".  What do you see going on within theDepartment of Justice as they prosecute these alleged leakers?</p><p>BETSY REED, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE INTERCEPT:  Like all journalismorganizations, we do not speak about our anonymous sources, so I can'tcomment any specifically about any of these cases.  But what I can sayis that this is part of an escalation of the war on whistle-blowersthat was launched really in earnest during the Obama administrationthat prosecuted eight journalistic sources under the Espionage Act.</p><p>[11:30:00] That is a 1919 statute that was actually designed fortraitors and spies, and it was applied against people who were reallystepping up to publicize information they thought was important forAmericans to know.  And what we've seen under Trump is an escalationof this very practice.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR:  You call them whistleblower, the otherwould say traitors.  What do you think viewers should know about thekind of information that these government officials are allegedlyproviding to reporters?</p><p>REED:  I think it's frankly preposterous to use the concept of traitorto describe someone who's brought into the public domain informationabout how the government is spying on its own citizens, how thegovernment is carry on wars around the world in secret and notallowing the public to engage in substantive debate about the factthat there are unconstitutional processes going on that it results inthe killing of American citizens abroad.</p><p>STELTER:  The idea that we deserve more information not lessespecially about America's wars is something that I think we shouldall be able to agree on but it becomes this just issue about thesources, deciding to commit a crime by leaking documents.  That's whatthe department justice is getting these individuals on.</p><p>What do you -- what do you say to people who worry about sourceprotection given that it seems like three of these investigationsinvolves people that leaked to your Web site?  Are you all doingenough to protect them?</p><p>REED:  Well we like other journalism organizations are doing our bestto deploy you know strategies like using encryption and othertechnologies that are digital security specialists help us with.  Butyou know, it's a risky business inherently doing national securityreporting.  Everybody on the beat knows that and they're knowing itincreasingly now because one of the things that we've reported a loton is surveillance, right, that the way that the governmentsurveillance ordinary citizens.</p><p>But in fact, when it comes to their own employees and contractors,that surveillance is you know, exponentially more powerful.  And sothey know everything their employees and contractors do.  They knowwhat Web sites they're reading.  They know who's printed whichdocument.  And so it is risky.  And we try to be quite upfront withpotential sources about what risks are entailed.</p><p>The fact is that deciding to become a whistleblower is a reallymomentous decision that takes a lot of courage and does entail riskthat can be mitigated but it can't be completely eradicated.</p><p>STELTER:  That's a challenge, an ongoing challenge.  Meantime, itseems like there was more of a chill in the air because of all these(INAUDIBLE), a challenge for your newsroom and for others.</p><p>REED:  Absolutely.  The Committee to Protect Journalists recently dida story that was about interviews with a number of national securityjournalists from the New York Times and other institutions and theyall said that there's a chill among their sources, that people areincreasingly afraid of coming forward with important information.</p><p>And information like you know, we learned from the Pentagon papers,from the COINTELPRO documents in the 1970s that provoked reallyimportant debates about the Vietnam War and about the FBI'sunconstitutional spying on Americans.</p><p>These are the kinds of stories that the government does not wantAmericans to know about and they will do everything in their power tostop it from coming out, which is why the work that national securityjournalists do is critically important and why every journalist shouldbe concerned about prosecutions of journalistic, alleged journalisticsources.</p><p>STELTER:  Betsy, thanks for being here.  Great to see you.</p><p>REED:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>STELTER:  Thank you.  A related story actually coming up next aboutsomeone who was arrested for leaking almost a decade ago.  Now ChelseaManning is facing jail time for a different reason.  She will join melive right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:35:00] STELTER:  Chelsea Manning was in prison for seven yearsafter leaking military and diplomatic secrets to WikiLeaks in 2010.She was facing up to 28 more years in prison when her sentence wascommuted by President Obama in 2017.  But two months ago, she was backbehind bars for refusing to testify to a grand jury in Virginia.</p><p>Prosecutors apparently wanted her to tell all about her contacts withWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.  Manning refused and said shealready told everything years ago and the judge held her in contempt.Three days ago she was released because that particular grand jury wasfinished.  But now she's facing another subpoena in just a few daysand possibly more jail time.</p><p>Chelsea Manning's joining me now here in New York.  Thank you forcoming in.</p><p>CHELSEA MANNING, FORMER INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, U.S. ARMY:  Hey, thanksfor having me.</p><p>STELTER:  What is going on with these grand juries?  What do they wantto know about Julian Assange from you?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, first off, nobody's actually -- and none of this hasany single person been specifically identified.  What they've asked mequestions about specifically are my conduct and how I did things whichI all -- which I methodically laid out in you know, hours of testimonyand a 40-page statement.</p><p>So they're really just trying to go through the same procedural youknow, the same -- the procedure of how things happened again.  And Ithink that --</p><p>STELTER:  They just want you to describe the same things again?</p><p>MANNING:  Yes, what they want to do.  So --</p><p>STELTER:  But it does seem like it's intended to be able to punishAssange further, right?  We already know he's been charged -- thegovernment seems to want to charge him with more counts and it seemsthat they want information from you for that.  Is that yourimpression?</p><p>MANNING:  I mean, I'm -- I think that's certainly my impression.  ButI think that what's interesting here is that the process of a grandjury is to obtain indictments.  We already have an indictment, so whyare we going through this process.  And I think that the kinds ofquestions that I've been asked are about disclosures and how thethings are disclosed and why they're disclosed as opposed to like thehow it was obtained.</p><p>They're -- they don't seem to be interested in how the -- and youknow, there's an enormous amount of computer forensics in this case.Like this is -- they don't need me to like do a case on like how ithappened.  They have that.  What they're really interested in is whatmy intentions were which I laid out in the testimony.  How -- you knowwhat my impressions of how that would look like would be and you know,like what -- you know how much of that would be published.  I thinkthat's more of their interest.STELTER:  And this was nine years ago that you were providing thisinformation to Julian Assange.  Some of it was cited as evidence ofwar crimes by the American government -- by the American military.This is still going off for you now nine years later.  Do you have anyregrets?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, first off, I just want to point out that I don'tactually know who I'm communicating with.  I certainly havesuspicions.  I certainly have suspicions and I believe I've laid outlike you know, I've laid out the -- in my testimony I said like youknow, like sure, there's like percentage ranges as to like who it could be,but I don't actually know who's on the other end of the of thesecommunications.</p><p>STELTER:  OK.</p><p>MANNING:  You know, so you know, the chat logs that you see, theindictment, which were in the court-martial record you know, we'vealready gone over this.  You know, I've said as much as I can sayabout that.  Now then, as to whether it -- I have any regrets youknow, like I -- it's -- I don't relitigate things.</p><p>Like I did what I did with the information that I had, the knowledgethat I had, and the tools and resources I had at the time.  The simplefact of the matter is that in 2010 -- you know, in 2010 when all this-- you know, all this happen it was very different you know,landscape.  You know, they -- even just trying to -- like I reachedout to the New York Times and The Washington Post.</p><p>I reached out to the Washington Post first because I actually seen allthe presidents meant so you know, so it was just this technologicalbarrier, you know, the lack of encryption tools, the lack of knowledgeabout -- on the part of reporters about how to protect -- you know,how to -- about how to communicate and verify this kind ofinformation.</p><p>[11:40:48] STELTER:  But WikiLeaks did know how.  Do you view theprosecution of Assange as a threat to press freedom?</p><p>MANNING:  I mean, I think that -- I think that the Eastern District ofVirginia is now turning into a rubber stamp for all these differentprosecutions that really are going after you know -- and I think thatultimately what they really want is they want to go after journalists.</p><p>Like the-- like the -- this administration clearly wants to go afterjournalists.  I think that if the administration gets its way as itslaid out you know, in repeated statements like the media is the enemyof the people kind of thing, you know -- you know, then I think thatwe're going to see that you know national security journalists and youknow a lot of -- a lot of disruptive you know, for this administrationpress.  We're probably going to see you know indictments and charges,you know, but perhaps indirectly related.</p><p>And the average American commits -- you know, there's so many offederal offenses.  The average American commits three felonies a day.So whenever journalism it makes a misstep, I think that they're put onnotice now that the FBI and the Department of Justice are going to goafter them on the administration's behalf.</p><p>STELTER:  And what about you?  You're due back on Thursday.</p><p>MANNING:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  Another subpoena for another grand jury.</p><p>MANNING:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  What's going to happen?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, if they're asking this -- they want -- they've alreadystipulated they want to ask the same questions.  So this is not about-- this is not about anything new.  They're not even asking anything-- they're not even asking anything new.  I've already laid all ofthis out.</p><p>STELTER:  So you're going to refuse again.</p><p>MANNING:  I am going to refuse.  I don't -- I think that this grandjury is an -- I mean, I think that all grand juries are improper.  Idon't like the secrecy of it.  One of the reasons why the -- why wehad so much -- why there was so much secrecy and speculation and likeso much like ham hand-wringing over the Mueller report was because ofthe secrecy.</p><p>We would know -- we would know far more if we would just have publichearings, bring the stuff out there and like you know -- and I did.  Itestified you know, before an open court with all these journaliststhere.  Like I have nothing new to provide.</p><p>STELTER:  But they want to hear from you again.  That's the law.  Willyou be back in jail next weekend?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, I'd be -- it's going to depend on -- we certainly havea motion to quash.  We're certainly going to raise every single legalchallenge.  We have -- we have very -- you know, we have a very strongcase.  We had a strong case previously but now we have additionalevidence as to what our case is.</p><p>STELTER:  So it's up in the air.  We don't know if you'll be sentencedto jail or not again.</p><p>MANNING:  We don't.  But you know, I think that we have a muchstronger case in terms of like the legal objections which you know,the previous judge didn't -- he refused to even hear.  He refused toeven hear them or act on the motions.  He just simply placed me incontempt and ignored our motions.</p><p>STELTER:  We talk all the time about unprincipled politicians and whatyou're doing is an act of principle whether viewers agree with it ornot, I can see that.  Chelsea thanks for being here.</p><p>MANNING:  Thank you.STELTER:  Great talking with you.  A quick break here and when we comeback, Carl Bernstein talking about all the week's news trying to putit all together.  We'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:45:00] STELTER:  So many Trump-related storylines are convergingall of them convoluted but many pointing in the same direction towardpresidential abuses of power.  So are members of the media living upto this challenge?  Let's ask Carl Bernstein.  He's here with me inNew York.  Carl, that's the question.  Are we living up to this momentin history?</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, by we if you mean thepress, I think -- I think yes.  Our institutions, so far the answeris, not hardly.</p><p>STELTER:  You mean the Congress?</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Well, the Congress of the United States particularlybecause there has been no real bipartisan investigation of the mostauthoritarian president in our history, probably.  And let's go backto basics here that we find ourselves in this situation right nowbecause there is an ongoing cover-up by the President of the UnitedStates.</p><p>Whether that constitutes a violation of law, whether he is a criminalor not, that's for down the road.  But right now it's obvious toanyone who watches, anyone who looks at the facts, reads the MuellerReport, the obstruction part, particularly, we are in the midst of acontinuing cover-up by the president aided and abetted by the AttorneyGeneral of the United States.</p><p>Trump said he wanted his Roy Cohn.  He's got him now in the AttorneyGeneral.  And where this is taking us is to an unprecedented place.It's not about a constitutional crisis, this is a systemic crisischallenging whether our institutions are able to function in thiscountry to deal with a president of the United States who is unique inour history, who has nothing but contempt for democratic tradition andthe rule of law.</p><p>So really where the rubber is going to meet the road is going to bethe Supreme Court of the United States.  And Chief Justice Roberts hasgot his table being set for him in a way that may have an awful lot todo with the future of American democracy.</p><p>STELTER:  You say systemic crisis though.  I think I hear his fansaying Trump just being a tough guy.  He's just holding on to hispower.  That's what every president would do.  They would say he's notso different from the past presidents.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Well, he's very different from past presidents.</p><p>STELTER  But I feel like Fox News viewers are fed about this narrativeabout Obama and other Democrats and make them all the same. BERNSTEIN:  Look, we can't -- we can't do anything about Fox News andwhat they feed their audience anymore.  What we need to do in thepress is to continue our reporting.  There is wide open area forreporting.  Look what the Wall Street Journal owned by the same personwho owns Fox News -- Fox News Rupert Murdoch reported last week aboutMcGahn stiffing the President of the United States and saying he wouldnot go and tell the Congress of the United States and others that thePresident had not obstructed justice, refused to do it.  Who producedthat story?</p><p>STELTER:  The Murdochs.  That's a great point</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  The Murdoch press.  So let's continue to do what we dobest.  You know, look at the tax story that the New York Times didshowing us that we have a grifter president of the United States, atax cheat, someone who is a fraud in business which is demonstrablewhich you've had his biographers who say the same thing, and now weare seeing the fraudulence through what the press is reporting today.</p><p>We need to be looking at the relationship of the Trump businessorganization with Russia and Russians and ethno Russians.  There'splenty of room for original reporting.  And incidentally, if thisstory were to go in some direction, that by some miracle exoneratedPresident Trump, so be it.</p><p>[11:50:35] STELTER:  That would be a good thing for the country.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  But so far -- so far all the evidence particularly theMueller report is so overwhelming.  And also, this is no exonerationabout his conduct in terms of Russia and Russian contacts.  That's notwhat the Mueller report says.</p><p>STELTER:  The Mueller report, let's talk more about that Muellerreport in just a moment.  We'll be right back more with Carl in just amoment here on RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STELTER:  Carl Bernstein is back with me here.  And Carl, I just wantto note, the Mueller report has stayed in power.  Look at this, numberone and two on the New York Times bestseller list this week.  Prettyimpressive for a free you know, free PDF.  All this talk about RobertMueller testifying, when will he -- will it happen, how important isit we hear from Mueller on television?</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  I think -- well, I think it's essential, whether hetestifies before the committee or whether he chooses another venue.If the president claims executive privilege before that body, perhapsthere's another venue that Mueller might choose, such as going ontelevision himself or members of his staff in such a way that theydon't reveal perhaps information that shouldn't be revealed forreasons of grand jury secrecy at the moment and at the same time, tellthe story about what this investigation was about and what it reallyfound.</p><p>We need to hear from that investigation, those who conducted theinvestigation and we also need the full report.  It is essential thatthe American people have the full report through their representativesin Congress, every word of it.  And there's one other thing we can'tforget.  There is an ongoing national security, counterintelligenceinvestigation that was not part of the Mueller report that is ongoing.</p><p>There is much more that is going to be learned I think we can say withsome absolute foreknowledge about what happened with Russians and whathappened with the Trump campaign and people around him.  But this ideaof the President getting up and claiming some kind of completeexoneration, I think it's necessary perhaps on some of our times onthe air, maybe we ought to read out loud and put up exactly what thereport said about that.  It did not say we exonerate the president.</p><p>[11:55:46] STELTER:  Right.  When Mitch McConnell says case closed, weshould show that the case is open.  Carl, thanks for being here.Great to see you.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Great to be here.</p><p>STELTER:  I appreciate it.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Thanks.</p><p>STELTER:  Happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching, especially mywife, my mom, my mother-in-law.

He says Mark Zuckerberg's power is unprecedentedand un-American, and he says the government must intervene by breakingup Facebook and enforcing new regulations.</p><p>Hughes dropped this op-ed on Thursday morning, then hopped on NPR,NBC, CNN, and he just appeared minutes ago on \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS.\"</p><p>And right now, Facebook is responding.</p><p>Nick Clegg is the company's new vice president for global affairs andcommunications and this is his first television interview.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here with me.</p><p>I think maybe we're having a little trouble with Nick.  Let see if wecan get him on.</p><p>All right.  Little bit of trouble.  What's that?</p><p>All right.  A little bit of trouble here with the new set.  That's OK.We're making a big move.  We're going to get to Nick in a coupleminutes.</p><p>In the meantime, while we work on that, let me bring in our panel.We've got an all-star panel.  It's already.  We're wired up and on setwith us.</p><p>Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizer and Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, a little bit surprise here but if you don't mind, let mestart with you.  This debate about Facebook and what to do, which isblared right here on the Sunday review section this morning, it isincredibly complicated, the idea breaking up Facebook, making themdivest Instagram and WhatsApp, et cetera.  And yet, the co-founderChris Hughes is not the only one talking about this.  Elizabeth Warrenis on the campaign trail promoting the same thing.</p><p>What does it say about our country and about the world that Facebookhas so much power that this is actively being debated?</p><p>CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think the issuehere is that Facebook has absolutely sinned against democracy, againstits users.  It's done a lot of bad things.  It hasn't protectedprivacy.  It's allowed Russian trolls and other adversaries to runloose and to manipulate its users.</p><p>But it's not clear to me that this particular prescription is actuallygoing to do a lot to solve that problem.  I don't really understandhow forcing Facebook for example to divest from WhatsApp is going todo anything to rein in the Russian trolls.</p><p>STELTER:  I see.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Facebook has had three years now since the 2016 electionwhen they essentially advocated the responsibility that they havedeliberately or not developed in terms of shaping our discourse andit's not clear that they really have a plan for protecting democracyor at least not letting democracy to get distorted for 2020.  I thinkthat's really the question for Facebook.  Why are they waiting forregulators to step in and help them do their job or tell them how todo their job.  Whether or not that involves an anti trust solution isa separate issue.</p><p>STELTER:  Well, I think we worked out the kinks.  So, let's ask thosequestions to Nick Clegg.  Let's see if we can get him on now from PaloAlto.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here.</p><p>NICK CLEGG, VICE PRESIDENT FOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS,FACEBOOK:  Yes, good to see you.  Sorry, it quite ironic.  FromSilicon Valley, we had some tech problems with the microphone but Ithink it's working now.</p><p>STELTER:  You know, I'm grateful you're here.  It's your firsttelevision interview in your new role of running comms and publicaffairs for Facebook.</p><p>CLEGG:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  Obviously, you disagree with Chris Hughes.  You don't wantFacebook broken up.  But why is he wrong, specifically?</p><p>CLEGG:  I don't think dismantling companies is the way to deal withsome of the complex issues which he quite rightly highlighted, datause, privacy, the attempt by folk from elsewhere to try and interferein our elections.  These are -- I don't in any way want to diminishthe importance of those and heavy responsibility that Facebook baresto play a prominent role in solving those problems.</p><p>But chopping a great American success story into bits is not somethingthat's going to make those problems go away.  They won't suddenlyevaporate.  There were still be Russian --</p><p>STELTER:  Then what do you propose instead?  Then what is going to bedone instead?</p><p>CLEGG:  Well, first, of course, Facebook needs to do more.  And we are-- we are confident that we're going to be considerably betterprepared for instance for the 2020 U.S. elections than we were for2016.</p><p>[11:05:03] And actually, just recently, some independent academicsfrom a network of universities, Princeton, Michigan, and elsewhere,have said that misinformation in our platforms has plummeted by 75percent, the extent of it compared to 2016.  And we need to do more.</p><p>And, of course, we need to do more on a whole range of other fronts,whether it is providing greater reassurance to people that data iskept securely and safe on Facebook platforms to guarantee people'sprivacy where they rightly are entitled to expect that.  So, ofcourse, Facebook is and continues and must continue to do more.</p><p>But equally, this is not something that any company can do on its own.We're dealing with some very profound ethical and political issues.We do also need regulators, politicians and legislatures to -- how canI put it -- sort of move beyond the sort of phase of just throwingrocks at each other or where politicians throw rocks at tech and techthrows rocks back.  I'm actually trying to sit down and come up withnew rules of the Internet.</p><p>The Internet is a relatively recent phenomenon.  Companies likeFacebook are still very young, only 15 years old.  They haveexperienced explosive growth around the world.  Yes, they encountereda number of challenges, problems, issues, have made mistakes in thepast which are self-inflicted, but I don't think anyone couldreasonably expect that any single company can come up with all theanswers on it own.</p><p>This is something that we need to do in partnership with regulatorsand lawmakers, not just in D.C. but around the world.</p><p>STELTER:  So, you're saying there are problems.  You just disagreewith Chris Hughes' problem how to solve them.  Back In 2017 when you were a British lawmaker, leading a partner overthere, you wrote about antitrust.  You said, I'm quoting here, as anold fashion liberal who believes in the virtues of competition, Iremain perplexed that the way U.S. competition law only seems to clearabout the effect of near monopoly market dominance by a tiny number ofbig players if and when it increases the prices paid by consumers.</p><p>Now, of course, Facebook is a free product, but it sure has all thefeel of a monopoly.</p><p>Have you changed your views in the past two years?</p><p>CLEGG:  No, I haven't changed my views.  I just don't think thatFacebook can reasonably be described by anyone as a monopoly.  Itfaces ferocious competition from -- everyone from YouTube to iMessage,from Snapchat to Pinterest.  I mean, there is a range of differentapps and platforms that you can use if you want to share videos,photos, if you want to message each other.</p><p>So, I don't think -- I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER:  But almost no one in the scale of Facebook and Instagram andWhatsApp.</p><p>CLEGG:  Well --</p><p>STELTER:  Almost no one with that scale and you buy up the companiesthat might have that scale.</p><p>CLEGG:  Well, let's remember when Facebook bought up WhatsApp andInstagram, they were considerably smaller than they are now.</p><p>STELTER:  True.</p><p>CLEGG:  I think it would be a rather odd message to send to Americanbusiness that when they grow businesses and ever make them ever moresuccessful, and allow millions, indeed, billions of consumers to usefor instance, WhatsApp for free, which it wasn't when it was bought upby Facebook, that somehow it should be penalized for that success.</p><p>I don't think -- in the eyes of non American, it's a very Americantradition to start penalizing success.  That is not -- that is notwhat antitrust law is used for.  I don't believe Facebook is amonopoly.</p><p>And, by the way, on the key sort f engine room by which Facebook makesmoney, which is on the digital advertising market, I think the latestestimate suggest we have about a 20 percent share of that market herein the United States.  Some of our competitors have a far, far largershare than that.</p><p>STELTER:  Google.</p><p>CLEGG:  So, it seems to be -- yes, sure.  But not just Google.  Wecompete with Goggle, we compete with Amazon and many of thesecompanies, by the way, are considerably bigger than Facebook.</p><p>I don't think anyone would think it's logical to say just because youdon't particularly like I think in Chris Hughes' case, he doesn't likeMark Zuckerberg's management style, or he doesn't like the leadershipof the company, you're going to take a sledgehammer to sort of crack anut and say, well, therefore, we're going to dismantle it alltogether.</p><p>And one thing I can tell you is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER:  I think he is saying this because of the poison, the amountof poison that is spread on Facebook and WhatsApp, not just in theU.S. but around the world, and elections in India and Brazil andelsewhere.  The problem is the poison that we're all choking on, and Iknow that Facebook didn't invent it, but it exists every day onFacebook.</p><p>CLEGG:  Sure.  But does anyone seriously think that poison or thatattempt to influence elections, unpleasant, hateful, violent contentis going to suddenly go away because Facebook has been broken up?  Inmany ways, you could -- you can make the argument, I certainly wouldmake the argument because we have considerably resources to apply tothe problem -- so, for instance, Facebook's artificial intelligencetools used to increasingly block hateful material before anyone seesit, over 99 percent of ISIS and Daesh, terrorist-related material isblocked before any human being sees it.</p><p>We also are allowed -- we're also able to provide those tools toInstagram.  You wouldn't be able to do that in the future.  We spendthis year, we will spend this year as a company more in making ourplatforms as safe and secure as we can and, yes, it's a constantbattle.</p><p>[11:10:06] It's a constant battle.  We're not going to pretend we'regoing to be able to, you know, find everything before folks see itand, of course, we need people to help us, to report material, whichwe can then either downgrade or take down.</p><p>But we will be spending more this year alone on those kind of effortsthan the total revenues of Facebook when it was publicly floatedearlier in a decade, all of that would be harder if we were to instead-- I don't know -- spend a decade in the courts deciding about whetherFacebook should be broken up or not.</p><p>STELTER:  It sometimes seems like reporters are the ones findingexamples of misinformation and other toxicity on your platform.  CNNBusiness this week, for example, wrote about Instagram and how the#vaccineskill was showing up prominently when you type in the wordvaccines.  After that CNN story, Instagram blocked the hashtag.</p><p>This seems like a really complicated situation, a situation wherejournalists are doing heavy lifting for you.  Is that a fairassessment?  Is that how the way it should work?  CLEGG:  Well, I certainly think we of course are under a duty andobligation not just journalist, when members of the public or anybody,and they can do it, of course, on the apps themselves, report materialthey don't think should be on the platforms.  We then respond.</p><p>So, yes, of course, we react.  But interestingly, what we're trying todo as a sort of general strategy is move from being reactive, which ofcourse was certainly the origins in the way we tackle the lose of thisunacceptable material and become more proactive.  I gave you thatexample of a terrorist-related, ISIS-related content earlier.</p><p>STELTER:  Right.</p><p>CLEGG:  But we've just -- we've just announced for instance that ourlatest -- and we produced these transparency reports every six monthswhere we tell the world how we'll we're doing or badly we're doing inblocking or identifying unacceptable content.</p><p>And on hate speech, which, of course, is much more complicated thanterrorist-related content because one person's hate speech is anotherperson's freedom of expression.  But on hate speech, our proactivesystems and our identifying close to 65 percent of hate speechmaterial before anyone sees it, which is up from 24 percent about ayear ago.  So, we're getting better.  Yes, we need, of course, thecooperation of other folk to be able to report material to us.</p><p>There is so much volume.  The volume, of course, that we're dealingwith is enormous.  Over 100 billion messages are communicated acrossour platforms.  That's just messages every day.</p><p>So I think we're getting better.  I think we do of course need tocooperate with others.  We do need new rules of the road, but I don'tthink it would be sensible for anyone, obviously, not for Facebook'spoint of view, but actually not for society's point of view as a wholeif instead we were going to start dismantling the company all togetherand as Chris Hughes argued -- and tell you, folk in Europe, MarkZuckerberg was in Paris just on Thursday and Friday talking toregulators there and to President Macron, and I strongly suspect folkin China well, we're looking dismayed at the idea that Americandecision makers want to break up successful American companies.</p><p>It's oddly enough, only a debate which is being sort of lead here, notin other jurisdictions.</p><p>STELTER:  Well, this is about costs and benefits, and we just need toreduce -- all of us collectively need to reduce the costs of theseplatforms and raise the benefits.</p><p>CLEGG:  Yes, totally.</p><p>STELTER:  You used to be a deputy prime minister of the U.K.  Why didyou decide to join Facebook now?</p><p>CLEGG:  Because I think there is debate about the kind of -- thefrontier, if I could put it like that between tech and society atlarge, our democracy, our privacy and so on is one of the mostimportant, one of the most fraught, yes, one of the most difficult andcontroversial debates around.  So when I was asked by Mark Zuckerbergand Sheryl Sandberg whether I wanted to join them not just on thecommunication side of things but I also run Facebook's policies.</p><p>STELTER:  Right.</p><p>CLEGG:  You know, for me, of course, that is a fantastic opportunityto play, I hope, a helpful role in ensuring that Facebook plays inturn a responsible role in this evolving debate, because, look, theway that the rules of the Internet are drawn today in my view orrather not drawn will be quite different to the way they are drawn in10 years time.</p><p>And I think big tech companies have a choice.  Either they play balland they try and play a responsible role in that debate or they tryand duck it all together.  And the moment that I heard from MarkZuckerberg that he wants Facebook to play an active and responsiblerole in helping to forge partnerships with regulations and governmentsaround the world so that we get these rules right for the future andfor future generations and, of course, for me that is a veryinteresting, interesting challenge.</p><p>STELTER:  Nick, thanks so much for coming on.  Please come back soon.</p><p>CLEGG:  Thank you.</p><p>STELTER:  Maybe we'll do it over Facebook Live next time.</p><p>CLEGG:  OK.  Thank you, thank you.</p><p>STELTER:  When we come back, the panel is back with me in just amoment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:18:22] STELTER:  Hey, welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES.  I'm BrianStelter.</p><p>Democracy in the United States is being tested.  Every day brings newheadlines about more subpoenas and more legal spats and morestonewalling.  Democrats say we're in a constitutional crisis.  And Ijust keep asking myself how are news consumers and how are citizenssupposed to make sense of this?</p><p>Now, the panel is back here with me now, Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizerand Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, if I had to have you summarize this week in all of thesedramatic developments in a headline, in a one-sentence headline, whatwould it be?</p><p>RAMPELL:  I would say the frog has been boiled.</p><p>STELTER:  Really?</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.STELTER:  We're at that point now?</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.  You know, I'm referring to if you put a progress in apot of water and you slowly raise the temperature, the frog won't jumpout, right, because they don't get they are about to be boiled.</p><p>Look, I think that the public is basically become inured to the ideathat Trump is just going to break norms, break laws, violate theConstitution, violate pretty clear statutes and that's just Trumpbeing Trump, you know?  It not a threat to democracy, that there is noconstitutional crisis, that it's all outrage and blends together andit's drama playing out.</p><p>STELTER:  The situation you're describing is kind of scary, though.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p>STELTER:  Jess, you laughed at the idea of the frog.  I think laughingin agreement.  What would your headline be?</p><p>JESS MCINTOSH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Trump is banking that youcan't keep up.  I think the headline from this week is that there weretoo many headlines and he's, he is absolutely putting all of his faithin the fact that the American people do not have time to follow allthe twists and turns of mechanizations of what he's trying to hide,the things he's stone walling on, the pieces of information he'srefusing to give up after being legally compelled to do so.</p><p>[11:20:05] People are busy.  They have jobs and lives and families.They're not able to follow a 24-hour -- I'm hardly able to follow a24-hour news cycle.</p><p>STELTER:  But you're coming to this as a liberal commentator, what doyou want the press to do differently?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  What I really want is to put pressure on the RepublicanParty at this point.  The only reason why we're in a constitutionalcrisis, the framers actually saw the chance that we might have apresident who refused to compile by the rule of law.  What they didn'tsee was that the entire political party who got him there would beengaged in helping them undermine our own democracy.</p><p>At some point, we have to ask Republicans how much they are willing tosacrifice in the future principles in order to let this guy run awaywith everything.</p><p>STELTER:  Julian, your headline this week, it's in \"The WashingtonPost\".  It's in today's paper.  It says Democrats are complicit ifthey don't impeach Trump.  The headline print is, it's time forimpeachment.</p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure, I think we are at amoment of impeachment proceedings.  My headline would be --</p><p>STELTER:  But we're not actually there in Washington.</p><p>ZELIZER: Well, that would be the headline, time for Congress to act.</p><p>I don't think we can depend on the public to sort through everything.That is why we have a House of Representatives.  I think the Muellerreport changed the dynamics in terms of putting a pretty troublingpicture out there for the public.</p><p>And just as important, this blanket stone wall that we have seen sincethe release of the report is unprecedented, in terms of usingpresidential power.  So now the Republicans are, they are complicit inletting this just go.  But House Democrats do have the authority andthey have to make a decision, do we start an impeachment process andthat's on the table.</p><p>STELTER:  And there's all this debate about the trade war, as well.</p><p>Catherine, you wrote a column this week titled, Trump's -- it's hotair and debt, that's what he's used over the years, over the decadesreally.  Hot air and debt.</p><p>RAMPELL:  I think what we have seen is that while many of us,including myself, used to say, oh, well, Trump says he's going to rungovernment like a business.  There is no relevance between managing amajor company and managing the federal government.</p><p>In fact, he's used a lot of same business practices that succeeded inhis business and applied them to the presidency which helped him andhurt the rest of us, including the idea that, you know, he treats thetax code, the law, the Constitution, as just an opening offer and thenhe uses the threat of unending litigation, of exhausting litigation,to basically get the other side, the side that has the law or theConstitution or tax code or legally binding contract or what-have-youon its side to get them to cede ground.</p><p>And I think that's a lesson he took from his business.  That's thelesson he's applying to the presidency.  He's done it with otherthings from his business, as well.</p><p>I mean, the headline refers to, you know, a lot of the debt he ran upwithin his company, but also the debt that he's run up within theUnited States.  He's kind of engaged in the same pump and dump policyeconomic style that the \"New York Times\" reported he engaged in in hisprivate business.</p><p>So, that's what I think we're seeing here.  That a lot of this sort ofunsavory aspects of trickery that helped him do well in a privatecompany he's using for ill.</p><p>STELTER:  We need to see it for what it is.  When it comes to the hotair and constant tweets, see it for what it is.</p><p>Let me turn to something you did this week on Capitol Hill, kind ofinteresting.  We broke this on CNN.com earlier about Fox trying to getmore Democrats on the air and more importantly, Democrats trying toget on Fox.  Democrats in the House of Representatives went to atraining session called \"Winning on Fox News\".</p><p>And you were one of the teachers?  Is that right word, Jess?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  One of the media trainers, yes.</p><p>STELTER:  What did you -- what did you share?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  So, I think there is a necessary debate happening in theDemocratic Party about whether or not it is appropriate to lendlegitimacy to Fox News.  Myself, I stopped appearing on Fox News a fewmonths before.</p><p>STELTER:  Even before you joined CNN --</p><p>MCINTOSH:  Even before I joined CNN, I made the decision that was notsomething I wanted to participate in as a Democratic strategist.  Isimply didn't want to help the propaganda arm of the Republican Party.</p><p>But when you're an elected official, the calculation is different.You have to represent people who might never vote for you, who mightnever share your views, and one of the only ways to get out of thismorass that we're in right now as a country is by showing folks thatthere are people there to do the right thing, who are there toaccomplish something for the people who sent them there.  I thinkthat's where the elected officials were coming from.</p><p>They -- generally, they were excited to reach this market share.There are tons of Fox viewers and not all reliable Republican voters.Some of them are -- they want to hear from Democrats in a way thatisn't tainted by the opinion folks over at Fox.  So I think thoseelected officials are excited about reaching those folks and let themknow there is more to what Democrats are doing on the Hill than whatthey are going to hear from that particular media outlet.</p><p>STELTER:  From prime time, especially.</p><p>MCINTOSH:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  To the panel, thank you so much.</p><p>Quick break here, and two more exclusive interviews.  \"TheIntercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed is standing by.  She's here toreact to another arrest of another person charged with leakinggovernment secrets to her website.</p><p>[11:25:03] And later, Chelsea Manning, her first interview since hewas released from prison last week.  Stick around.  We'll be rightback.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STELTER:  Welcome back.</p><p>This week, we got word that a former intelligence analyst named DanielHale has been hit with charges for leaking classified documents to areporter back in 2014.  He's been arrested.  He's now facing charges.</p><p>The indictment doesn't name the reporter or the outlet in question,but it's pretty clear the recipients of this alleged leak were JeremyScahill and \"The Intercept\" website.  The site came out with dronepapers back in 2015.  This was a really important investigation withinformation about Obama's drone wars.</p><p>Hale is the fifth federal employee to be charged with leakingsensitive information during the Trump administration's years.  Thisis an on going escalation of what the Obama administration was doingfor the eight years Obama was in office.</p><p>Let me bring in \"The Intercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed.  She'shere with me now in New York.</p><p>Betsey, thanks for coming over.  Happy Mother's Day.</p><p>:  Thank you, Brian.</p><p>STELTER:  I wish this was under better circumstances.</p><p>We now know of three cases where there are people accused of leakingit seems to \"The Intercept\".  What do you see going on within theDepartment of Justice as they prosecute these alleged leakers?</p><p>BETSY REED, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE INTERCEPT:  Like all journalismorganizations, we do not speak about our anonymous sources, so I can'tcomment any specifically about any of these cases.  But what I can sayis that this is part of an escalation of the war on whistle-blowersthat was launched really in earnest during the Obama administrationthat prosecuted eight journalistic sources under the Espionage Act.</p><p>[11:30:00] That is a 1919 statute that was actually designed fortraitors and spies, and it was applied against people who were reallystepping up to publicize information they thought was important forAmericans to know.  And what we've seen under Trump is an escalationof this very practice.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR:  You call them whistleblower, the otherwould say traitors.  What do you think viewers should know about thekind of information that these government officials are allegedlyproviding to reporters?</p><p>REED:  I think it's frankly preposterous to use the concept of traitorto describe someone who's brought into the public domain informationabout how the government is spying on its own citizens, how thegovernment is carry on wars around the world in secret and notallowing the public to engage in substantive debate about the factthat there are unconstitutional processes going on that it results inthe killing of American citizens abroad.</p><p>STELTER:  The idea that we deserve more information not lessespecially about America's wars is something that I think we shouldall be able to agree on but it becomes this just issue about thesources, deciding to commit a crime by leaking documents.  That's whatthe department justice is getting these individuals on.</p><p>What do you -- what do you say to people who worry about sourceprotection given that it seems like three of these investigationsinvolves people that leaked to your Web site?  Are you all doingenough to protect them?</p><p>REED:  Well we like other journalism organizations are doing our bestto deploy you know strategies like using encryption and othertechnologies that are digital security specialists help us with.  Butyou know, it's a risky business inherently doing national securityreporting.  Everybody on the beat knows that and they're knowing itincreasingly now because one of the things that we've reported a loton is surveillance, right, that the way that the governmentsurveillance ordinary citizens.</p><p>But in fact, when it comes to their own employees and contractors,that surveillance is you know, exponentially more powerful.  And sothey know everything their employees and contractors do.  They knowwhat Web sites they're reading.  They know who's printed whichdocument.  And so it is risky.  And we try to be quite upfront withpotential sources about what risks are entailed.</p><p>The fact is that deciding to become a whistleblower is a reallymomentous decision that takes a lot of courage and does entail riskthat can be mitigated but it can't be completely eradicated.</p><p>STELTER:  That's a challenge, an ongoing challenge.  Meantime, itseems like there was more of a chill in the air because of all these(INAUDIBLE), a challenge for your newsroom and for others.</p><p>REED:  Absolutely.  The Committee to Protect Journalists recently dida story that was about interviews with a number of national securityjournalists from the New York Times and other institutions and theyall said that there's a chill among their sources, that people areincreasingly afraid of coming forward with important information.</p><p>And information like you know, we learned from the Pentagon papers,from the COINTELPRO documents in the 1970s that provoked reallyimportant debates about the Vietnam War and about the FBI'sunconstitutional spying on Americans.</p><p>These are the kinds of stories that the government does not wantAmericans to know about and they will do everything in their power tostop it from coming out, which is why the work that national securityjournalists do is critically important and why every journalist shouldbe concerned about prosecutions of journalistic, alleged journalisticsources.</p><p>STELTER:  Betsy, thanks for being here.  Great to see you.</p><p>REED:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>STELTER:  Thank you.  A related story actually coming up next aboutsomeone who was arrested for leaking almost a decade ago.  Now ChelseaManning is facing jail time for a different reason.  She will join melive right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:35:00] STELTER:  Chelsea Manning was in prison for seven yearsafter leaking military and diplomatic secrets to WikiLeaks in 2010.She was facing up to 28 more years in prison when her sentence wascommuted by President Obama in 2017.  But two months ago, she was backbehind bars for refusing to testify to a grand jury in Virginia.</p><p>Prosecutors apparently wanted her to tell all about her contacts withWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.  Manning refused and said shealready told everything years ago and the judge held her in contempt.Three days ago she was released because that particular grand jury wasfinished.  But now she's facing another subpoena in just a few daysand possibly more jail time.</p><p>Chelsea Manning's joining me now here in New York.  Thank you forcoming in.</p><p>CHELSEA MANNING, FORMER INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, U.S. ARMY:  Hey, thanksfor having me.</p><p>STELTER:  What is going on with these grand juries?  What do they wantto know about Julian Assange from you?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, first off, nobody's actually -- and none of this hasany single person been specifically identified.  What they've asked mequestions about specifically are my conduct and how I did things whichI all -- which I methodically laid out in you know, hours of testimonyand a 40-page statement.</p><p>So they're really just trying to go through the same procedural youknow, the same -- the procedure of how things happened again.  And Ithink that --</p><p>STELTER:  They just want you to describe the same things again?</p><p>MANNING:  Yes, what they want to do.  So --</p><p>STELTER:  But it does seem like it's intended to be able to punishAssange further, right?  We already know he's been charged -- thegovernment seems to want to charge him with more counts and it seemsthat they want information from you for that.  Is that yourimpression?</p><p>MANNING:  I mean, I'm -- I think that's certainly my impression.  ButI think that what's interesting here is that the process of a grandjury is to obtain indictments.  We already have an indictment, so whyare we going through this process.  And I think that the kinds ofquestions that I've been asked are about disclosures and how thethings are disclosed and why they're disclosed as opposed to like thehow it was obtained.</p><p>They're -- they don't seem to be interested in how the -- and youknow, there's an enormous amount of computer forensics in this case.Like this is -- they don't need me to like do a case on like how ithappened.  They have that.  What they're really interested in is whatmy intentions were which I laid out in the testimony.  How -- you knowwhat my impressions of how that would look like would be and you know,like what -- you know how much of that would be published.  I thinkthat's more of their interest.STELTER:  And this was nine years ago that you were providing thisinformation to Julian Assange.  Some of it was cited as evidence ofwar crimes by the American government -- by the American military.This is still going off for you now nine years later.  Do you have anyregrets?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, first off, I just want to point out that I don'tactually know who I'm communicating with.  I certainly havesuspicions.  I certainly have suspicions and I believe I've laid outlike you know, I've laid out the -- in my testimony I said like youknow, like sure, there's like percentage ranges as to like who it could be,but I don't actually know who's on the other end of the of thesecommunications.</p><p>STELTER:  OK.</p><p>MANNING:  You know, so you know, the chat logs that you see, theindictment, which were in the court-martial record you know, we'vealready gone over this.  You know, I've said as much as I can sayabout that.  Now then, as to whether it -- I have any regrets youknow, like I -- it's -- I don't relitigate things.</p><p>Like I did what I did with the information that I had, the knowledgethat I had, and the tools and resources I had at the time.  The simplefact of the matter is that in 2010 -- you know, in 2010 when all this-- you know, all this happen it was very different you know,landscape.  You know, they -- even just trying to -- like I reachedout to the New York Times and The Washington Post.</p><p>I reached out to the Washington Post first because I actually seen allthe presidents meant so you know, so it was just this technologicalbarrier, you know, the lack of encryption tools, the lack of knowledgeabout -- on the part of reporters about how to protect -- you know,how to -- about how to communicate and verify this kind ofinformation.</p><p>[11:40:48] STELTER:  But WikiLeaks did know how.  Do you view theprosecution of Assange as a threat to press freedom?</p><p>MANNING:  I mean, I think that -- I think that the Eastern District ofVirginia is now turning into a rubber stamp for all these differentprosecutions that really are going after you know -- and I think thatultimately what they really want is they want to go after journalists.</p><p>Like the-- like the -- this administration clearly wants to go afterjournalists.  I think that if the administration gets its way as itslaid out you know, in repeated statements like the media is the enemyof the people kind of thing, you know -- you know, then I think thatwe're going to see that you know national security journalists and youknow a lot of -- a lot of disruptive you know, for this administrationpress.  We're probably going to see you know indictments and charges,you know, but perhaps indirectly related.</p><p>And the average American commits -- you know, there's so many offederal offenses.  The average American commits three felonies a day.So whenever journalism it makes a misstep, I think that they're put onnotice now that the FBI and the Department of Justice are going to goafter them on the administration's behalf.</p><p>STELTER:  And what about you?  You're due back on Thursday.</p><p>MANNING:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  Another subpoena for another grand jury.</p><p>MANNING:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  What's going to happen?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, if they're asking this -- they want -- they've alreadystipulated they want to ask the same questions.  So this is not about-- this is not about anything new.  They're not even asking anything-- they're not even asking anything new.  I've already laid all ofthis out.</p><p>STELTER:  So you're going to refuse again.</p><p>MANNING:  I am going to refuse.  I don't -- I think that this grandjury is an -- I mean, I think that all grand juries are improper.  Idon't like the secrecy of it.  One of the reasons why the -- why wehad so much -- why there was so much secrecy and speculation and likeso much like ham hand-wringing over the Mueller report was because ofthe secrecy.</p><p>We would know -- we would know far more if we would just have publichearings, bring the stuff out there and like you know -- and I did.  Itestified you know, before an open court with all these journaliststhere.  Like I have nothing new to provide.</p><p>STELTER:  But they want to hear from you again.  That's the law.  Willyou be back in jail next weekend?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, I'd be -- it's going to depend on -- we certainly havea motion to quash.  We're certainly going to raise every single legalchallenge.  We have -- we have very -- you know, we have a very strongcase.  We had a strong case previously but now we have additionalevidence as to what our case is.</p><p>STELTER:  So it's up in the air.  We don't know if you'll be sentencedto jail or not again.</p><p>MANNING:  We don't.  But you know, I think that we have a muchstronger case in terms of like the legal objections which you know,the previous judge didn't -- he refused to even hear.  He refused toeven hear them or act on the motions.  He just simply placed me incontempt and ignored our motions.</p><p>STELTER:  We talk all the time about unprincipled politicians and whatyou're doing is an act of principle whether viewers agree with it ornot, I can see that.  Chelsea thanks for being here.</p><p>MANNING:  Thank you.STELTER:  Great talking with you.  A quick break here and when we comeback, Carl Bernstein talking about all the week's news trying to putit all together.  We'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:45:00] STELTER:  So many Trump-related storylines are convergingall of them convoluted but many pointing in the same direction towardpresidential abuses of power.  So are members of the media living upto this challenge?  Let's ask Carl Bernstein.  He's here with me inNew York.  Carl, that's the question.  Are we living up to this momentin history?</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, by we if you mean thepress, I think -- I think yes.  Our institutions, so far the answeris, not hardly.</p><p>STELTER:  You mean the Congress?</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Well, the Congress of the United States particularlybecause there has been no real bipartisan investigation of the mostauthoritarian president in our history, probably.  And let's go backto basics here that we find ourselves in this situation right nowbecause there is an ongoing cover-up by the President of the UnitedStates.</p><p>Whether that constitutes a violation of law, whether he is a criminalor not, that's for down the road.  But right now it's obvious toanyone who watches, anyone who looks at the facts, reads the MuellerReport, the obstruction part, particularly, we are in the midst of acontinuing cover-up by the president aided and abetted by the AttorneyGeneral of the United States.</p><p>Trump said he wanted his Roy Cohn.  He's got him now in the AttorneyGeneral.  And where this is taking us is to an unprecedented place.It's not about a constitutional crisis, this is a systemic crisischallenging whether our institutions are able to function in thiscountry to deal with a president of the United States who is unique inour history, who has nothing but contempt for democratic tradition andthe rule of law.</p><p>So really where the rubber is going to meet the road is going to bethe Supreme Court of the United States.  And Chief Justice Roberts hasgot his table being set for him in a way that may have an awful lot todo with the future of American democracy.</p><p>STELTER:  You say systemic crisis though.  I think I hear his fansaying Trump just being a tough guy.  He's just holding on to hispower.  That's what every president would do.  They would say he's notso different from the past presidents.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Well, he's very different from past presidents.</p><p>STELTER  But I feel like Fox News viewers are fed about this narrativeabout Obama and other Democrats and make them all the same. BERNSTEIN:  Look, we can't -- we can't do anything about Fox News andwhat they feed their audience anymore.  What we need to do in thepress is to continue our reporting.  There is wide open area forreporting.  Look what the Wall Street Journal owned by the same personwho owns Fox News -- Fox News Rupert Murdoch reported last week aboutMcGahn stiffing the President of the United States and saying he wouldnot go and tell the Congress of the United States and others that thePresident had not obstructed justice, refused to do it.  Who producedthat story?</p><p>STELTER:  The Murdochs.  That's a great point</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  The Murdoch press.  So let's continue to do what we dobest.  You know, look at the tax story that the New York Times didshowing us that we have a grifter president of the United States, atax cheat, someone who is a fraud in business which is demonstrablewhich you've had his biographers who say the same thing, and now weare seeing the fraudulence through what the press is reporting today.</p><p>We need to be looking at the relationship of the Trump businessorganization with Russia and Russians and ethno Russians.  There'splenty of room for original reporting.  And incidentally, if thisstory were to go in some direction, that by some miracle exoneratedPresident Trump, so be it.</p><p>[11:50:35] STELTER:  That would be a good thing for the country.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  But so far -- so far all the evidence particularly theMueller report is so overwhelming.  And also, this is no exonerationabout his conduct in terms of Russia and Russian contacts.  That's notwhat the Mueller report says.</p><p>STELTER:  The Mueller report, let's talk more about that Muellerreport in just a moment.  We'll be right back more with Carl in just amoment here on RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STELTER:  Carl Bernstein is back with me here.  And Carl, I just wantto note, the Mueller report has stayed in power.  Look at this, numberone and two on the New York Times bestseller list this week.  Prettyimpressive for a free you know, free PDF.  All this talk about RobertMueller testifying, when will he -- will it happen, how important isit we hear from Mueller on television?</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  I think -- well, I think it's essential, whether hetestifies before the committee or whether he chooses another venue.If the president claims executive privilege before that body, perhapsthere's another venue that Mueller might choose, such as going ontelevision himself or members of his staff in such a way that theydon't reveal perhaps information that shouldn't be revealed forreasons of grand jury secrecy at the moment and at the same time, tellthe story about what this investigation was about and what it reallyfound.</p><p>We need to hear from that investigation, those who conducted theinvestigation and we also need the full report.  It is essential thatthe American people have the full report through their representativesin Congress, every word of it.  And there's one other thing we can'tforget.  There is an ongoing national security, counterintelligenceinvestigation that was not part of the Mueller report that is ongoing.</p><p>There is much more that is going to be learned I think we can say withsome absolute foreknowledge about what happened with Russians and whathappened with the Trump campaign and people around him.  But this ideaof the President getting up and claiming some kind of completeexoneration, I think it's necessary perhaps on some of our times onthe air, maybe we ought to read out loud and put up exactly what thereport said about that.  It did not say we exonerate the president.</p><p>[11:55:46] STELTER:  Right.  When Mitch McConnell says case closed, weshould show that the case is open.  Carl, thanks for being here.Great to see you.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Great to be here.</p><p>STELTER:  I appreciate it.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Thanks.</p><p>STELTER:  Happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching, especially mywife, my mom, my mother-in-law.

HappyMother's Day and welcome to RELIABLE SOURCES from CNN's brand-newstudio here in New York City.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's what we have coming up for you this hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chelsea Manning is out of jail but facing another subpoena, whichmeans she may be back in jail in just a few days.  In the meantime,she's here to join me live for an exclusive interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, something many know a lot about, leak hunts.  Another federalemployee stands accused of slipping classified information to \"TheIntercept\" website.  \"The Intercept's\" top editor will join me live toreact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And later, to Fox or not to Fox.  That's the question for Democrats.I'll speak with one of the people who was on Capitol Hill this weekteaching lawmakers about how to appear on Fox News.  What a job.</p><p>But first, today, the Facebook debate.  Everybody has an opinion aboutFacebook.  The company's actions and inactions have huge consequencesfor politics, business and news media.</p><p>And Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is coming out swinging with thisop-ed in \"The New York Times\", declaring that the social network hasbecome dangerous.  He says Mark Zuckerberg's power is unprecedentedand un-American, and he says the government must intervene by breakingup Facebook and enforcing new regulations.</p><p>Hughes dropped this op-ed on Thursday morning, then hopped on NPR,NBC, CNN, and he just appeared minutes ago on \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS.\"</p><p>And right now, Facebook is responding.</p><p>Nick Clegg is the company's new vice president for global affairs andcommunications and this is his first television interview.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here with me.</p><p>I think maybe we're having a little trouble with Nick.  Let see if wecan get him on.</p><p>All right.  Little bit of trouble.  What's that?</p><p>All right.  A little bit of trouble here with the new set.  That's OK.We're making a big move.  We're going to get to Nick in a coupleminutes.</p><p>In the meantime, while we work on that, let me bring in our panel.We've got an all-star panel.  It's already.  We're wired up and on setwith us.</p><p>Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizer and Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, a little bit surprise here but if you don't mind, let mestart with you.  This debate about Facebook and what to do, which isblared right here on the Sunday review section this morning, it isincredibly complicated, the idea breaking up Facebook, making themdivest Instagram and WhatsApp, et cetera.  And yet, the co-founderChris Hughes is not the only one talking about this.  Elizabeth Warrenis on the campaign trail promoting the same thing.</p><p>What does it say about our country and about the world that Facebookhas so much power that this is actively being debated?</p><p>CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think the issuehere is that Facebook has absolutely sinned against democracy, againstits users.  It's done a lot of bad things.  It hasn't protectedprivacy.  It's allowed Russian trolls and other adversaries to runloose and to manipulate its users.</p><p>But it's not clear to me that this particular prescription is actuallygoing to do a lot to solve that problem.  I don't really understandhow forcing Facebook for example to divest from WhatsApp is going todo anything to rein in the Russian trolls.</p><p>STELTER:  I see.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Facebook has had three years now since the 2016 electionwhen they essentially advocated the responsibility that they havedeliberately or not developed in terms of shaping our discourse andit's not clear that they really have a plan for protecting democracyor at least not letting democracy to get distorted for 2020.  I thinkthat's really the question for Facebook.  Why are they waiting forregulators to step in and help them do their job or tell them how todo their job.  Whether or not that involves an anti trust solution isa separate issue.</p><p>STELTER:  Well, I think we worked out the kinks.  So, let's ask thosequestions to Nick Clegg.  Let's see if we can get him on now from PaloAlto.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here.</p><p>NICK CLEGG, VICE PRESIDENT FOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS,FACEBOOK:  Yes, good to see you.  Sorry, it quite ironic.  FromSilicon Valley, we had some tech problems with the microphone but Ithink it's working now.</p><p>STELTER:  You know, I'm grateful you're here.  It's your firsttelevision interview in your new role of running comms and publicaffairs for Facebook.</p><p>CLEGG:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  Obviously, you disagree with Chris Hughes.  You don't wantFacebook broken up.  But why is he wrong, specifically?</p><p>CLEGG:  I don't think dismantling companies is the way to deal withsome of the complex issues which he quite rightly highlighted, datause, privacy, the attempt by folk from elsewhere to try and interferein our elections.  These are -- I don't in any way want to diminishthe importance of those and heavy responsibility that Facebook baresto play a prominent role in solving those problems.</p><p>But chopping a great American success story into bits is not somethingthat's going to make those problems go away.  They won't suddenlyevaporate.  There were still be Russian --</p><p>STELTER:  Then what do you propose instead?  Then what is going to bedone instead?</p><p>CLEGG:  Well, first, of course, Facebook needs to do more.  And we are-- we are confident that we're going to be considerably betterprepared for instance for the 2020 U.S. elections than we were for2016.</p><p>[11:05:03] And actually, just recently, some independent academicsfrom a network of universities, Princeton, Michigan, and elsewhere,have said that misinformation in our platforms has plummeted by 75percent, the extent of it compared to 2016.  And we need to do more.</p><p>And, of course, we need to do more on a whole range of other fronts,whether it is providing greater reassurance to people that data iskept securely and safe on Facebook platforms to guarantee people'sprivacy where they rightly are entitled to expect that.  So, ofcourse, Facebook is and continues and must continue to do more.</p><p>But equally, this is not something that any company can do on its own.We're dealing with some very profound ethical and political issues.We do also need regulators, politicians and legislatures to -- how canI put it -- sort of move beyond the sort of phase of just throwingrocks at each other or where politicians throw rocks at tech and techthrows rocks back.  I'm actually trying to sit down and come up withnew rules of the Internet.</p><p>The Internet is a relatively recent phenomenon.  Companies likeFacebook are still very young, only 15 years old.  They haveexperienced explosive growth around the world.  Yes, they encountereda number of challenges, problems, issues, have made mistakes in thepast which are self-inflicted, but I don't think anyone couldreasonably expect that any single company can come up with all theanswers on it own.</p><p>This is something that we need to do in partnership with regulatorsand lawmakers, not just in D.C. but around the world.</p><p>STELTER:  So, you're saying there are problems.  You just disagreewith Chris Hughes' problem how to solve them.  Back In 2017 when you were a British lawmaker, leading a partner overthere, you wrote about antitrust.  You said, I'm quoting here, as anold fashion liberal who believes in the virtues of competition, Iremain perplexed that the way U.S. competition law only seems to clearabout the effect of near monopoly market dominance by a tiny number ofbig players if and when it increases the prices paid by consumers.</p><p>Now, of course, Facebook is a free product, but it sure has all thefeel of a monopoly.</p><p>Have you changed your views in the past two years?</p><p>CLEGG:  No, I haven't changed my views.  I just don't think thatFacebook can reasonably be described by anyone as a monopoly.  Itfaces ferocious competition from -- everyone from YouTube to iMessage,from Snapchat to Pinterest.  I mean, there is a range of differentapps and platforms that you can use if you want to share videos,photos, if you want to message each other.</p><p>So, I don't think -- I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER:  But almost no one in the scale of Facebook and Instagram andWhatsApp.</p><p>CLEGG:  Well --</p><p>STELTER:  Almost no one with that scale and you buy up the companiesthat might have that scale.</p><p>CLEGG:  Well, let's remember when Facebook bought up WhatsApp andInstagram, they were considerably smaller than they are now.</p><p>STELTER:  True.</p><p>CLEGG:  I think it would be a rather odd message to send to Americanbusiness that when they grow businesses and ever make them ever moresuccessful, and allow millions, indeed, billions of consumers to usefor instance, WhatsApp for free, which it wasn't when it was bought upby Facebook, that somehow it should be penalized for that success.</p><p>I don't think -- in the eyes of non American, it's a very Americantradition to start penalizing success.  That is not -- that is notwhat antitrust law is used for.  I don't believe Facebook is amonopoly.</p><p>And, by the way, on the key sort f engine room by which Facebook makesmoney, which is on the digital advertising market, I think the latestestimate suggest we have about a 20 percent share of that market herein the United States.  Some of our competitors have a far, far largershare than that.</p><p>STELTER:  Google.</p><p>CLEGG:  So, it seems to be -- yes, sure.  But not just Google.  Wecompete with Goggle, we compete with Amazon and many of thesecompanies, by the way, are considerably bigger than Facebook.</p><p>I don't think anyone would think it's logical to say just because youdon't particularly like I think in Chris Hughes' case, he doesn't likeMark Zuckerberg's management style, or he doesn't like the leadershipof the company, you're going to take a sledgehammer to sort of crack anut and say, well, therefore, we're going to dismantle it alltogether.</p><p>And one thing I can tell you is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER:  I think he is saying this because of the poison, the amountof poison that is spread on Facebook and WhatsApp, not just in theU.S. but around the world, and elections in India and Brazil andelsewhere.  The problem is the poison that we're all choking on, and Iknow that Facebook didn't invent it, but it exists every day onFacebook.</p><p>CLEGG:  Sure.  But does anyone seriously think that poison or thatattempt to influence elections, unpleasant, hateful, violent contentis going to suddenly go away because Facebook has been broken up?  Inmany ways, you could -- you can make the argument, I certainly wouldmake the argument because we have considerably resources to apply tothe problem -- so, for instance, Facebook's artificial intelligencetools used to increasingly block hateful material before anyone seesit, over 99 percent of ISIS and Daesh, terrorist-related material isblocked before any human being sees it.</p><p>We also are allowed -- we're also able to provide those tools toInstagram.  You wouldn't be able to do that in the future.  We spendthis year, we will spend this year as a company more in making ourplatforms as safe and secure as we can and, yes, it's a constantbattle.</p><p>[11:10:06] It's a constant battle.  We're not going to pretend we'regoing to be able to, you know, find everything before folks see itand, of course, we need people to help us, to report material, whichwe can then either downgrade or take down.</p><p>But we will be spending more this year alone on those kind of effortsthan the total revenues of Facebook when it was publicly floatedearlier in a decade, all of that would be harder if we were to instead-- I don't know -- spend a decade in the courts deciding about whetherFacebook should be broken up or not.</p><p>STELTER:  It sometimes seems like reporters are the ones findingexamples of misinformation and other toxicity on your platform.  CNNBusiness this week, for example, wrote about Instagram and how the#vaccineskill was showing up prominently when you type in the wordvaccines.  After that CNN story, Instagram blocked the hashtag.</p><p>This seems like a really complicated situation, a situation wherejournalists are doing heavy lifting for you.  Is that a fairassessment?  Is that how the way it should work?  CLEGG:  Well, I certainly think we of course are under a duty andobligation not just journalist, when members of the public or anybody,and they can do it, of course, on the apps themselves, report materialthey don't think should be on the platforms.  We then respond.</p><p>So, yes, of course, we react.  But interestingly, what we're trying todo as a sort of general strategy is move from being reactive, which ofcourse was certainly the origins in the way we tackle the lose of thisunacceptable material and become more proactive.  I gave you thatexample of a terrorist-related, ISIS-related content earlier.</p><p>STELTER:  Right.</p><p>CLEGG:  But we've just -- we've just announced for instance that ourlatest -- and we produced these transparency reports every six monthswhere we tell the world how we'll we're doing or badly we're doing inblocking or identifying unacceptable content.</p><p>And on hate speech, which, of course, is much more complicated thanterrorist-related content because one person's hate speech is anotherperson's freedom of expression.  But on hate speech, our proactivesystems and our identifying close to 65 percent of hate speechmaterial before anyone sees it, which is up from 24 percent about ayear ago.  So, we're getting better.  Yes, we need, of course, thecooperation of other folk to be able to report material to us.</p><p>There is so much volume.  The volume, of course, that we're dealingwith is enormous.  Over 100 billion messages are communicated acrossour platforms.  That's just messages every day.</p><p>So I think we're getting better.  I think we do of course need tocooperate with others.  We do need new rules of the road, but I don'tthink it would be sensible for anyone, obviously, not for Facebook'spoint of view, but actually not for society's point of view as a wholeif instead we were going to start dismantling the company all togetherand as Chris Hughes argued -- and tell you, folk in Europe, MarkZuckerberg was in Paris just on Thursday and Friday talking toregulators there and to President Macron, and I strongly suspect folkin China well, we're looking dismayed at the idea that Americandecision makers want to break up successful American companies.</p><p>It's oddly enough, only a debate which is being sort of lead here, notin other jurisdictions.</p><p>STELTER:  Well, this is about costs and benefits, and we just need toreduce -- all of us collectively need to reduce the costs of theseplatforms and raise the benefits.</p><p>CLEGG:  Yes, totally.</p><p>STELTER:  You used to be a deputy prime minister of the U.K.  Why didyou decide to join Facebook now?</p><p>CLEGG:  Because I think there is debate about the kind of -- thefrontier, if I could put it like that between tech and society atlarge, our democracy, our privacy and so on is one of the mostimportant, one of the most fraught, yes, one of the most difficult andcontroversial debates around.  So when I was asked by Mark Zuckerbergand Sheryl Sandberg whether I wanted to join them not just on thecommunication side of things but I also run Facebook's policies.</p><p>STELTER:  Right.</p><p>CLEGG:  You know, for me, of course, that is a fantastic opportunityto play, I hope, a helpful role in ensuring that Facebook plays inturn a responsible role in this evolving debate, because, look, theway that the rules of the Internet are drawn today in my view orrather not drawn will be quite different to the way they are drawn in10 years time.</p><p>And I think big tech companies have a choice.  Either they play balland they try and play a responsible role in that debate or they tryand duck it all together.  And the moment that I heard from MarkZuckerberg that he wants Facebook to play an active and responsiblerole in helping to forge partnerships with regulations and governmentsaround the world so that we get these rules right for the future andfor future generations and, of course, for me that is a veryinteresting, interesting challenge.</p><p>STELTER:  Nick, thanks so much for coming on.  Please come back soon.</p><p>CLEGG:  Thank you.</p><p>STELTER:  Maybe we'll do it over Facebook Live next time.</p><p>CLEGG:  OK.  Thank you, thank you.</p><p>STELTER:  When we come back, the panel is back with me in just amoment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:18:22] STELTER:  Hey, welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES.  I'm BrianStelter.</p><p>Democracy in the United States is being tested.  Every day brings newheadlines about more subpoenas and more legal spats and morestonewalling.  Democrats say we're in a constitutional crisis.  And Ijust keep asking myself how are news consumers and how are citizenssupposed to make sense of this?</p><p>Now, the panel is back here with me now, Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizerand Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, if I had to have you summarize this week in all of thesedramatic developments in a headline, in a one-sentence headline, whatwould it be?</p><p>RAMPELL:  I would say the frog has been boiled.</p><p>STELTER:  Really?</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.STELTER:  We're at that point now?</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.  You know, I'm referring to if you put a progress in apot of water and you slowly raise the temperature, the frog won't jumpout, right, because they don't get they are about to be boiled.</p><p>Look, I think that the public is basically become inured to the ideathat Trump is just going to break norms, break laws, violate theConstitution, violate pretty clear statutes and that's just Trumpbeing Trump, you know?  It not a threat to democracy, that there is noconstitutional crisis, that it's all outrage and blends together andit's drama playing out.</p><p>STELTER:  The situation you're describing is kind of scary, though.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p>STELTER:  Jess, you laughed at the idea of the frog.  I think laughingin agreement.  What would your headline be?</p><p>JESS MCINTOSH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Trump is banking that youcan't keep up.  I think the headline from this week is that there weretoo many headlines and he's, he is absolutely putting all of his faithin the fact that the American people do not have time to follow allthe twists and turns of mechanizations of what he's trying to hide,the things he's stone walling on, the pieces of information he'srefusing to give up after being legally compelled to do so.</p><p>[11:20:05] People are busy.  They have jobs and lives and families.They're not able to follow a 24-hour -- I'm hardly able to follow a24-hour news cycle.</p><p>STELTER:  But you're coming to this as a liberal commentator, what doyou want the press to do differently?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  What I really want is to put pressure on the RepublicanParty at this point.  The only reason why we're in a constitutionalcrisis, the framers actually saw the chance that we might have apresident who refused to compile by the rule of law.  What they didn'tsee was that the entire political party who got him there would beengaged in helping them undermine our own democracy.</p><p>At some point, we have to ask Republicans how much they are willing tosacrifice in the future principles in order to let this guy run awaywith everything.</p><p>STELTER:  Julian, your headline this week, it's in \"The WashingtonPost\".  It's in today's paper.  It says Democrats are complicit ifthey don't impeach Trump.  The headline print is, it's time forimpeachment.</p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure, I think we are at amoment of impeachment proceedings.  My headline would be --</p><p>STELTER:  But we're not actually there in Washington.</p><p>ZELIZER: Well, that would be the headline, time for Congress to act.</p><p>I don't think we can depend on the public to sort through everything.That is why we have a House of Representatives.  I think the Muellerreport changed the dynamics in terms of putting a pretty troublingpicture out there for the public.</p><p>And just as important, this blanket stone wall that we have seen sincethe release of the report is unprecedented, in terms of usingpresidential power.  So now the Republicans are, they are complicit inletting this just go.  But House Democrats do have the authority andthey have to make a decision, do we start an impeachment process andthat's on the table.</p><p>STELTER:  And there's all this debate about the trade war, as well.</p><p>Catherine, you wrote a column this week titled, Trump's -- it's hotair and debt, that's what he's used over the years, over the decadesreally.  Hot air and debt.</p><p>RAMPELL:  I think what we have seen is that while many of us,including myself, used to say, oh, well, Trump says he's going to rungovernment like a business.  There is no relevance between managing amajor company and managing the federal government.</p><p>In fact, he's used a lot of same business practices that succeeded inhis business and applied them to the presidency which helped him andhurt the rest of us, including the idea that, you know, he treats thetax code, the law, the Constitution, as just an opening offer and thenhe uses the threat of unending litigation, of exhausting litigation,to basically get the other side, the side that has the law or theConstitution or tax code or legally binding contract or what-have-youon its side to get them to cede ground.</p><p>And I think that's a lesson he took from his business.  That's thelesson he's applying to the presidency.  He's done it with otherthings from his business, as well.</p><p>I mean, the headline refers to, you know, a lot of the debt he ran upwithin his company, but also the debt that he's run up within theUnited States.  He's kind of engaged in the same pump and dump policyeconomic style that the \"New York Times\" reported he engaged in in hisprivate business.</p><p>So, that's what I think we're seeing here.  That a lot of this sort ofunsavory aspects of trickery that helped him do well in a privatecompany he's using for ill.</p><p>STELTER:  We need to see it for what it is.  When it comes to the hotair and constant tweets, see it for what it is.</p><p>Let me turn to something you did this week on Capitol Hill, kind ofinteresting.  We broke this on CNN.com earlier about Fox trying to getmore Democrats on the air and more importantly, Democrats trying toget on Fox.  Democrats in the House of Representatives went to atraining session called \"Winning on Fox News\".</p><p>And you were one of the teachers?  Is that right word, Jess?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  One of the media trainers, yes.</p><p>STELTER:  What did you -- what did you share?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  So, I think there is a necessary debate happening in theDemocratic Party about whether or not it is appropriate to lendlegitimacy to Fox News.  Myself, I stopped appearing on Fox News a fewmonths before.</p><p>STELTER:  Even before you joined CNN --</p><p>MCINTOSH:  Even before I joined CNN, I made the decision that was notsomething I wanted to participate in as a Democratic strategist.  Isimply didn't want to help the propaganda arm of the Republican Party.</p><p>But when you're an elected official, the calculation is different.You have to represent people who might never vote for you, who mightnever share your views, and one of the only ways to get out of thismorass that we're in right now as a country is by showing folks thatthere are people there to do the right thing, who are there toaccomplish something for the people who sent them there.  I thinkthat's where the elected officials were coming from.</p><p>They -- generally, they were excited to reach this market share.There are tons of Fox viewers and not all reliable Republican voters.Some of them are -- they want to hear from Democrats in a way thatisn't tainted by the opinion folks over at Fox.  So I think thoseelected officials are excited about reaching those folks and let themknow there is more to what Democrats are doing on the Hill than whatthey are going to hear from that particular media outlet.</p><p>STELTER:  From prime time, especially.</p><p>MCINTOSH:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  To the panel, thank you so much.</p><p>Quick break here, and two more exclusive interviews.  \"TheIntercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed is standing by.  She's here toreact to another arrest of another person charged with leakinggovernment secrets to her website.</p><p>[11:25:03] And later, Chelsea Manning, her first interview since hewas released from prison last week.  Stick around.  We'll be rightback.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STELTER:  Welcome back.</p><p>This week, we got word that a former intelligence analyst named DanielHale has been hit with charges for leaking classified documents to areporter back in 2014.  He's been arrested.  He's now facing charges.</p><p>The indictment doesn't name the reporter or the outlet in question,but it's pretty clear the recipients of this alleged leak were JeremyScahill and \"The Intercept\" website.  The site came out with dronepapers back in 2015.  This was a really important investigation withinformation about Obama's drone wars.</p><p>Hale is the fifth federal employee to be charged with leakingsensitive information during the Trump administration's years.  Thisis an on going escalation of what the Obama administration was doingfor the eight years Obama was in office.</p><p>Let me bring in \"The Intercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed.  She'shere with me now in New York.</p><p>Betsey, thanks for coming over.  Happy Mother's Day.</p><p>:  Thank you, Brian.</p><p>STELTER:  I wish this was under better circumstances.</p><p>We now know of three cases where there are people accused of leakingit seems to \"The Intercept\".  What do you see going on within theDepartment of Justice as they prosecute these alleged leakers?</p><p>BETSY REED, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE INTERCEPT:  Like all journalismorganizations, we do not speak about our anonymous sources, so I can'tcomment any specifically about any of these cases.  But what I can sayis that this is part of an escalation of the war on whistle-blowersthat was launched really in earnest during the Obama administrationthat prosecuted eight journalistic sources under the Espionage Act.</p><p>[11:30:00] That is a 1919 statute that was actually designed fortraitors and spies, and it was applied against people who were reallystepping up to publicize information they thought was important forAmericans to know.  And what we've seen under Trump is an escalationof this very practice.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR:  You call them whistleblower, the otherwould say traitors.  What do you think viewers should know about thekind of information that these government officials are allegedlyproviding to reporters?</p><p>REED:  I think it's frankly preposterous to use the concept of traitorto describe someone who's brought into the public domain informationabout how the government is spying on its own citizens, how thegovernment is carry on wars around the world in secret and notallowing the public to engage in substantive debate about the factthat there are unconstitutional processes going on that it results inthe killing of American citizens abroad.</p><p>STELTER:  The idea that we deserve more information not lessespecially about America's wars is something that I think we shouldall be able to agree on but it becomes this just issue about thesources, deciding to commit a crime by leaking documents.  That's whatthe department justice is getting these individuals on.</p><p>What do you -- what do you say to people who worry about sourceprotection given that it seems like three of these investigationsinvolves people that leaked to your Web site?  Are you all doingenough to protect them?</p><p>REED:  Well we like other journalism organizations are doing our bestto deploy you know strategies like using encryption and othertechnologies that are digital security specialists help us with.  Butyou know, it's a risky business inherently doing national securityreporting.  Everybody on the beat knows that and they're knowing itincreasingly now because one of the things that we've reported a loton is surveillance, right, that the way that the governmentsurveillance ordinary citizens.</p><p>But in fact, when it comes to their own employees and contractors,that surveillance is you know, exponentially more powerful.  And sothey know everything their employees and contractors do.  They knowwhat Web sites they're reading.  They know who's printed whichdocument.  And so it is risky.  And we try to be quite upfront withpotential sources about what risks are entailed.</p><p>The fact is that deciding to become a whistleblower is a reallymomentous decision that takes a lot of courage and does entail riskthat can be mitigated but it can't be completely eradicated.</p><p>STELTER:  That's a challenge, an ongoing challenge.  Meantime, itseems like there was more of a chill in the air because of all these(INAUDIBLE), a challenge for your newsroom and for others.</p><p>REED:  Absolutely.  The Committee to Protect Journalists recently dida story that was about interviews with a number of national securityjournalists from the New York Times and other institutions and theyall said that there's a chill among their sources, that people areincreasingly afraid of coming forward with important information.</p><p>And information like you know, we learned from the Pentagon papers,from the COINTELPRO documents in the 1970s that provoked reallyimportant debates about the Vietnam War and about the FBI'sunconstitutional spying on Americans.</p><p>These are the kinds of stories that the government does not wantAmericans to know about and they will do everything in their power tostop it from coming out, which is why the work that national securityjournalists do is critically important and why every journalist shouldbe concerned about prosecutions of journalistic, alleged journalisticsources.</p><p>STELTER:  Betsy, thanks for being here.  Great to see you.</p><p>REED:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>STELTER:  Thank you.  A related story actually coming up next aboutsomeone who was arrested for leaking almost a decade ago.  Now ChelseaManning is facing jail time for a different reason.  She will join melive right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:35:00] STELTER:  Chelsea Manning was in prison for seven yearsafter leaking military and diplomatic secrets to WikiLeaks in 2010.She was facing up to 28 more years in prison when her sentence wascommuted by President Obama in 2017.  But two months ago, she was backbehind bars for refusing to testify to a grand jury in Virginia.</p><p>Prosecutors apparently wanted her to tell all about her contacts withWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.  Manning refused and said shealready told everything years ago and the judge held her in contempt.Three days ago she was released because that particular grand jury wasfinished.  But now she's facing another subpoena in just a few daysand possibly more jail time.</p><p>Chelsea Manning's joining me now here in New York.  Thank you forcoming in.</p><p>CHELSEA MANNING, FORMER INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, U.S. ARMY:  Hey, thanksfor having me.</p><p>STELTER:  What is going on with these grand juries?  What do they wantto know about Julian Assange from you?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, first off, nobody's actually -- and none of this hasany single person been specifically identified.  What they've asked mequestions about specifically are my conduct and how I did things whichI all -- which I methodically laid out in you know, hours of testimonyand a 40-page statement.</p><p>So they're really just trying to go through the same procedural youknow, the same -- the procedure of how things happened again.  And Ithink that --</p><p>STELTER:  They just want you to describe the same things again?</p><p>MANNING:  Yes, what they want to do.  So --</p><p>STELTER:  But it does seem like it's intended to be able to punishAssange further, right?  We already know he's been charged -- thegovernment seems to want to charge him with more counts and it seemsthat they want information from you for that.  Is that yourimpression?</p><p>MANNING:  I mean, I'm -- I think that's certainly my impression.  ButI think that what's interesting here is that the process of a grandjury is to obtain indictments.  We already have an indictment, so whyare we going through this process.  And I think that the kinds ofquestions that I've been asked are about disclosures and how thethings are disclosed and why they're disclosed as opposed to like thehow it was obtained.</p><p>They're -- they don't seem to be interested in how the -- and youknow, there's an enormous amount of computer forensics in this case.Like this is -- they don't need me to like do a case on like how ithappened.  They have that.  What they're really interested in is whatmy intentions were which I laid out in the testimony.  How -- you knowwhat my impressions of how that would look like would be and you know,like what -- you know how much of that would be published.  I thinkthat's more of their interest.STELTER:  And this was nine years ago that you were providing thisinformation to Julian Assange.  Some of it was cited as evidence ofwar crimes by the American government -- by the American military.This is still going off for you now nine years later.  Do you have anyregrets?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, first off, I just want to point out that I don'tactually know who I'm communicating with.  I certainly havesuspicions.  I certainly have suspicions and I believe I've laid outlike you know, I've laid out the -- in my testimony I said like youknow, like sure, there's like percentage ranges as to like who it could be,but I don't actually know who's on the other end of the of thesecommunications.</p><p>STELTER:  OK.</p><p>MANNING:  You know, so you know, the chat logs that you see, theindictment, which were in the court-martial record you know, we'vealready gone over this.  You know, I've said as much as I can sayabout that.  Now then, as to whether it -- I have any regrets youknow, like I -- it's -- I don't relitigate things.</p><p>Like I did what I did with the information that I had, the knowledgethat I had, and the tools and resources I had at the time.  The simplefact of the matter is that in 2010 -- you know, in 2010 when all this-- you know, all this happen it was very different you know,landscape.  You know, they -- even just trying to -- like I reachedout to the New York Times and The Washington Post.</p><p>I reached out to the Washington Post first because I actually seen allthe presidents meant so you know, so it was just this technologicalbarrier, you know, the lack of encryption tools, the lack of knowledgeabout -- on the part of reporters about how to protect -- you know,how to -- about how to communicate and verify this kind ofinformation.</p><p>[11:40:48] STELTER:  But WikiLeaks did know how.  Do you view theprosecution of Assange as a threat to press freedom?</p><p>MANNING:  I mean, I think that -- I think that the Eastern District ofVirginia is now turning into a rubber stamp for all these differentprosecutions that really are going after you know -- and I think thatultimately what they really want is they want to go after journalists.</p><p>Like the-- like the -- this administration clearly wants to go afterjournalists.  I think that if the administration gets its way as itslaid out you know, in repeated statements like the media is the enemyof the people kind of thing, you know -- you know, then I think thatwe're going to see that you know national security journalists and youknow a lot of -- a lot of disruptive you know, for this administrationpress.  We're probably going to see you know indictments and charges,you know, but perhaps indirectly related.</p><p>And the average American commits -- you know, there's so many offederal offenses.  The average American commits three felonies a day.So whenever journalism it makes a misstep, I think that they're put onnotice now that the FBI and the Department of Justice are going to goafter them on the administration's behalf.</p><p>STELTER:  And what about you?  You're due back on Thursday.</p><p>MANNING:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  Another subpoena for another grand jury.</p><p>MANNING:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  What's going to happen?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, if they're asking this -- they want -- they've alreadystipulated they want to ask the same questions.  So this is not about-- this is not about anything new.  They're not even asking anything-- they're not even asking anything new.  I've already laid all ofthis out.</p><p>STELTER:  So you're going to refuse again.</p><p>MANNING:  I am going to refuse.  I don't -- I think that this grandjury is an -- I mean, I think that all grand juries are improper.  Idon't like the secrecy of it.  One of the reasons why the -- why wehad so much -- why there was so much secrecy and speculation and likeso much like ham hand-wringing over the Mueller report was because ofthe secrecy.</p><p>We would know -- we would know far more if we would just have publichearings, bring the stuff out there and like you know -- and I did.  Itestified you know, before an open court with all these journaliststhere.  Like I have nothing new to provide.</p><p>STELTER:  But they want to hear from you again.  That's the law.  Willyou be back in jail next weekend?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, I'd be -- it's going to depend on -- we certainly havea motion to quash.  We're certainly going to raise every single legalchallenge.  We have -- we have very -- you know, we have a very strongcase.  We had a strong case previously but now we have additionalevidence as to what our case is.</p><p>STELTER:  So it's up in the air.  We don't know if you'll be sentencedto jail or not again.</p><p>MANNING:  We don't.  But you know, I think that we have a muchstronger case in terms of like the legal objections which you know,the previous judge didn't -- he refused to even hear.  He refused toeven hear them or act on the motions.  He just simply placed me incontempt and ignored our motions.</p><p>STELTER:  We talk all the time about unprincipled politicians and whatyou're doing is an act of principle whether viewers agree with it ornot, I can see that.  Chelsea thanks for being here.</p><p>MANNING:  Thank you.STELTER:  Great talking with you.  A quick break here and when we comeback, Carl Bernstein talking about all the week's news trying to putit all together.  We'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:45:00] STELTER:  So many Trump-related storylines are convergingall of them convoluted but many pointing in the same direction towardpresidential abuses of power.  So are members of the media living upto this challenge?  Let's ask Carl Bernstein.  He's here with me inNew York.  Carl, that's the question.  Are we living up to this momentin history?</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, by we if you mean thepress, I think -- I think yes.  Our institutions, so far the answeris, not hardly.</p><p>STELTER:  You mean the Congress?</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Well, the Congress of the United States particularlybecause there has been no real bipartisan investigation of the mostauthoritarian president in our history, probably.  And let's go backto basics here that we find ourselves in this situation right nowbecause there is an ongoing cover-up by the President of the UnitedStates.</p><p>Whether that constitutes a violation of law, whether he is a criminalor not, that's for down the road.  But right now it's obvious toanyone who watches, anyone who looks at the facts, reads the MuellerReport, the obstruction part, particularly, we are in the midst of acontinuing cover-up by the president aided and abetted by the AttorneyGeneral of the United States.</p><p>Trump said he wanted his Roy Cohn.  He's got him now in the AttorneyGeneral.  And where this is taking us is to an unprecedented place.It's not about a constitutional crisis, this is a systemic crisischallenging whether our institutions are able to function in thiscountry to deal with a president of the United States who is unique inour history, who has nothing but contempt for democratic tradition andthe rule of law.</p><p>So really where the rubber is going to meet the road is going to bethe Supreme Court of the United States.  And Chief Justice Roberts hasgot his table being set for him in a way that may have an awful lot todo with the future of American democracy.</p><p>STELTER:  You say systemic crisis though.  I think I hear his fansaying Trump just being a tough guy.  He's just holding on to hispower.  That's what every president would do.  They would say he's notso different from the past presidents.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Well, he's very different from past presidents.</p><p>STELTER  But I feel like Fox News viewers are fed about this narrativeabout Obama and other Democrats and make them all the same. BERNSTEIN:  Look, we can't -- we can't do anything about Fox News andwhat they feed their audience anymore.  What we need to do in thepress is to continue our reporting.  There is wide open area forreporting.  Look what the Wall Street Journal owned by the same personwho owns Fox News -- Fox News Rupert Murdoch reported last week aboutMcGahn stiffing the President of the United States and saying he wouldnot go and tell the Congress of the United States and others that thePresident had not obstructed justice, refused to do it.  Who producedthat story?</p><p>STELTER:  The Murdochs.  That's a great point</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  The Murdoch press.  So let's continue to do what we dobest.  You know, look at the tax story that the New York Times didshowing us that we have a grifter president of the United States, atax cheat, someone who is a fraud in business which is demonstrablewhich you've had his biographers who say the same thing, and now weare seeing the fraudulence through what the press is reporting today.</p><p>We need to be looking at the relationship of the Trump businessorganization with Russia and Russians and ethno Russians.  There'splenty of room for original reporting.  And incidentally, if thisstory were to go in some direction, that by some miracle exoneratedPresident Trump, so be it.</p><p>[11:50:35] STELTER:  That would be a good thing for the country.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  But so far -- so far all the evidence particularly theMueller report is so overwhelming.  And also, this is no exonerationabout his conduct in terms of Russia and Russian contacts.  That's notwhat the Mueller report says.</p><p>STELTER:  The Mueller report, let's talk more about that Muellerreport in just a moment.  We'll be right back more with Carl in just amoment here on RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STELTER:  Carl Bernstein is back with me here.  And Carl, I just wantto note, the Mueller report has stayed in power.  Look at this, numberone and two on the New York Times bestseller list this week.  Prettyimpressive for a free you know, free PDF.  All this talk about RobertMueller testifying, when will he -- will it happen, how important isit we hear from Mueller on television?</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  I think -- well, I think it's essential, whether hetestifies before the committee or whether he chooses another venue.If the president claims executive privilege before that body, perhapsthere's another venue that Mueller might choose, such as going ontelevision himself or members of his staff in such a way that theydon't reveal perhaps information that shouldn't be revealed forreasons of grand jury secrecy at the moment and at the same time, tellthe story about what this investigation was about and what it reallyfound.</p><p>We need to hear from that investigation, those who conducted theinvestigation and we also need the full report.  It is essential thatthe American people have the full report through their representativesin Congress, every word of it.  And there's one other thing we can'tforget.  There is an ongoing national security, counterintelligenceinvestigation that was not part of the Mueller report that is ongoing.</p><p>There is much more that is going to be learned I think we can say withsome absolute foreknowledge about what happened with Russians and whathappened with the Trump campaign and people around him.  But this ideaof the President getting up and claiming some kind of completeexoneration, I think it's necessary perhaps on some of our times onthe air, maybe we ought to read out loud and put up exactly what thereport said about that.  It did not say we exonerate the president.</p><p>[11:55:46] STELTER:  Right.  When Mitch McConnell says case closed, weshould show that the case is open.  Carl, thanks for being here.Great to see you.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Great to be here.</p><p>STELTER:  I appreciate it.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Thanks.</p><p>STELTER:  Happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching, especially mywife, my mom, my mother-in-law.

HappyMother's Day and welcome to RELIABLE SOURCES from CNN's brand-newstudio here in New York City.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's what we have coming up for you this hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chelsea Manning is out of jail but facing another subpoena, whichmeans she may be back in jail in just a few days.  In the meantime,she's here to join me live for an exclusive interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, something many know a lot about, leak hunts.  Another federalemployee stands accused of slipping classified information to \"TheIntercept\" website.  \"The Intercept's\" top editor will join me live toreact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And later, to Fox or not to Fox.  That's the question for Democrats.I'll speak with one of the people who was on Capitol Hill this weekteaching lawmakers about how to appear on Fox News.  What a job.</p><p>But first, today, the Facebook debate.  Everybody has an opinion aboutFacebook.  The company's actions and inactions have huge consequencesfor politics, business and news media.</p><p>And Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is coming out swinging with thisop-ed in \"The New York Times\", declaring that the social network hasbecome dangerous.  He says Mark Zuckerberg's power is unprecedentedand un-American, and he says the government must intervene by breakingup Facebook and enforcing new regulations.</p><p>Hughes dropped this op-ed on Thursday morning, then hopped on NPR,NBC, CNN, and he just appeared minutes ago on \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS.\"</p><p>And right now, Facebook is responding.</p><p>Nick Clegg is the company's new vice president for global affairs andcommunications and this is his first television interview.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here with me.</p><p>I think maybe we're having a little trouble with Nick.  Let see if wecan get him on.</p><p>All right.  Little bit of trouble.  What's that?</p><p>All right.  A little bit of trouble here with the new set.  That's OK.We're making a big move.  We're going to get to Nick in a coupleminutes.</p><p>In the meantime, while we work on that, let me bring in our panel.We've got an all-star panel.  It's already.  We're wired up and on setwith us.</p><p>Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizer and Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, a little bit surprise here but if you don't mind, let mestart with you.  This debate about Facebook and what to do, which isblared right here on the Sunday review section this morning, it isincredibly complicated, the idea breaking up Facebook, making themdivest Instagram and WhatsApp, et cetera.  And yet, the co-founderChris Hughes is not the only one talking about this.  Elizabeth Warrenis on the campaign trail promoting the same thing.</p><p>What does it say about our country and about the world that Facebookhas so much power that this is actively being debated?</p><p>CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think the issuehere is that Facebook has absolutely sinned against democracy, againstits users.  It's done a lot of bad things.  It hasn't protectedprivacy.  It's allowed Russian trolls and other adversaries to runloose and to manipulate its users.</p><p>But it's not clear to me that this particular prescription is actuallygoing to do a lot to solve that problem.  I don't really understandhow forcing Facebook for example to divest from WhatsApp is going todo anything to rein in the Russian trolls.</p><p>STELTER:  I see.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Facebook has had three years now since the 2016 electionwhen they essentially advocated the responsibility that they havedeliberately or not developed in terms of shaping our discourse andit's not clear that they really have a plan for protecting democracyor at least not letting democracy to get distorted for 2020.  I thinkthat's really the question for Facebook.  Why are they waiting forregulators to step in and help them do their job or tell them how todo their job.  Whether or not that involves an anti trust solution isa separate issue.</p><p>STELTER:  Well, I think we worked out the kinks.  So, let's ask thosequestions to Nick Clegg.  Let's see if we can get him on now from PaloAlto.</p><p>Nick, thanks for being here.</p><p>NICK CLEGG, VICE PRESIDENT FOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS,FACEBOOK:  Yes, good to see you.  Sorry, it quite ironic.  FromSilicon Valley, we had some tech problems with the microphone but Ithink it's working now.</p><p>STELTER:  You know, I'm grateful you're here.  It's your firsttelevision interview in your new role of running comms and publicaffairs for Facebook.</p><p>CLEGG:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  Obviously, you disagree with Chris Hughes.  You don't wantFacebook broken up.  But why is he wrong, specifically?</p><p>CLEGG:  I don't think dismantling companies is the way to deal withsome of the complex issues which he quite rightly highlighted, datause, privacy, the attempt by folk from elsewhere to try and interferein our elections.  These are -- I don't in any way want to diminishthe importance of those and heavy responsibility that Facebook baresto play a prominent role in solving those problems.</p><p>But chopping a great American success story into bits is not somethingthat's going to make those problems go away.  They won't suddenlyevaporate.  There were still be Russian --</p><p>STELTER:  Then what do you propose instead?  Then what is going to bedone instead?</p><p>CLEGG:  Well, first, of course, Facebook needs to do more.  And we are-- we are confident that we're going to be considerably betterprepared for instance for the 2020 U.S. elections than we were for2016.</p><p>[11:05:03] And actually, just recently, some independent academicsfrom a network of universities, Princeton, Michigan, and elsewhere,have said that misinformation in our platforms has plummeted by 75percent, the extent of it compared to 2016.  And we need to do more.</p><p>And, of course, we need to do more on a whole range of other fronts,whether it is providing greater reassurance to people that data iskept securely and safe on Facebook platforms to guarantee people'sprivacy where they rightly are entitled to expect that.  So, ofcourse, Facebook is and continues and must continue to do more.</p><p>But equally, this is not something that any company can do on its own.We're dealing with some very profound ethical and political issues.We do also need regulators, politicians and legislatures to -- how canI put it -- sort of move beyond the sort of phase of just throwingrocks at each other or where politicians throw rocks at tech and techthrows rocks back.  I'm actually trying to sit down and come up withnew rules of the Internet.</p><p>The Internet is a relatively recent phenomenon.  Companies likeFacebook are still very young, only 15 years old.  They haveexperienced explosive growth around the world.  Yes, they encountereda number of challenges, problems, issues, have made mistakes in thepast which are self-inflicted, but I don't think anyone couldreasonably expect that any single company can come up with all theanswers on it own.</p><p>This is something that we need to do in partnership with regulatorsand lawmakers, not just in D.C. but around the world.</p><p>STELTER:  So, you're saying there are problems.  You just disagreewith Chris Hughes' problem how to solve them.  Back In 2017 when you were a British lawmaker, leading a partner overthere, you wrote about antitrust.  You said, I'm quoting here, as anold fashion liberal who believes in the virtues of competition, Iremain perplexed that the way U.S. competition law only seems to clearabout the effect of near monopoly market dominance by a tiny number ofbig players if and when it increases the prices paid by consumers.</p><p>Now, of course, Facebook is a free product, but it sure has all thefeel of a monopoly.</p><p>Have you changed your views in the past two years?</p><p>CLEGG:  No, I haven't changed my views.  I just don't think thatFacebook can reasonably be described by anyone as a monopoly.  Itfaces ferocious competition from -- everyone from YouTube to iMessage,from Snapchat to Pinterest.  I mean, there is a range of differentapps and platforms that you can use if you want to share videos,photos, if you want to message each other.</p><p>So, I don't think -- I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER:  But almost no one in the scale of Facebook and Instagram andWhatsApp.</p><p>CLEGG:  Well --</p><p>STELTER:  Almost no one with that scale and you buy up the companiesthat might have that scale.</p><p>CLEGG:  Well, let's remember when Facebook bought up WhatsApp andInstagram, they were considerably smaller than they are now.</p><p>STELTER:  True.</p><p>CLEGG:  I think it would be a rather odd message to send to Americanbusiness that when they grow businesses and ever make them ever moresuccessful, and allow millions, indeed, billions of consumers to usefor instance, WhatsApp for free, which it wasn't when it was bought upby Facebook, that somehow it should be penalized for that success.</p><p>I don't think -- in the eyes of non American, it's a very Americantradition to start penalizing success.  That is not -- that is notwhat antitrust law is used for.  I don't believe Facebook is amonopoly.</p><p>And, by the way, on the key sort f engine room by which Facebook makesmoney, which is on the digital advertising market, I think the latestestimate suggest we have about a 20 percent share of that market herein the United States.  Some of our competitors have a far, far largershare than that.</p><p>STELTER:  Google.</p><p>CLEGG:  So, it seems to be -- yes, sure.  But not just Google.  Wecompete with Goggle, we compete with Amazon and many of thesecompanies, by the way, are considerably bigger than Facebook.</p><p>I don't think anyone would think it's logical to say just because youdon't particularly like I think in Chris Hughes' case, he doesn't likeMark Zuckerberg's management style, or he doesn't like the leadershipof the company, you're going to take a sledgehammer to sort of crack anut and say, well, therefore, we're going to dismantle it alltogether.</p><p>And one thing I can tell you is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER:  I think he is saying this because of the poison, the amountof poison that is spread on Facebook and WhatsApp, not just in theU.S. but around the world, and elections in India and Brazil andelsewhere.  The problem is the poison that we're all choking on, and Iknow that Facebook didn't invent it, but it exists every day onFacebook.</p><p>CLEGG:  Sure.  But does anyone seriously think that poison or thatattempt to influence elections, unpleasant, hateful, violent contentis going to suddenly go away because Facebook has been broken up?  Inmany ways, you could -- you can make the argument, I certainly wouldmake the argument because we have considerably resources to apply tothe problem -- so, for instance, Facebook's artificial intelligencetools used to increasingly block hateful material before anyone seesit, over 99 percent of ISIS and Daesh, terrorist-related material isblocked before any human being sees it.</p><p>We also are allowed -- we're also able to provide those tools toInstagram.  You wouldn't be able to do that in the future.  We spendthis year, we will spend this year as a company more in making ourplatforms as safe and secure as we can and, yes, it's a constantbattle.</p><p>[11:10:06] It's a constant battle.  We're not going to pretend we'regoing to be able to, you know, find everything before folks see itand, of course, we need people to help us, to report material, whichwe can then either downgrade or take down.</p><p>But we will be spending more this year alone on those kind of effortsthan the total revenues of Facebook when it was publicly floatedearlier in a decade, all of that would be harder if we were to instead-- I don't know -- spend a decade in the courts deciding about whetherFacebook should be broken up or not.</p><p>STELTER:  It sometimes seems like reporters are the ones findingexamples of misinformation and other toxicity on your platform.  CNNBusiness this week, for example, wrote about Instagram and how the#vaccineskill was showing up prominently when you type in the wordvaccines.  After that CNN story, Instagram blocked the hashtag.</p><p>This seems like a really complicated situation, a situation wherejournalists are doing heavy lifting for you.  Is that a fairassessment?  Is that how the way it should work?  CLEGG:  Well, I certainly think we of course are under a duty andobligation not just journalist, when members of the public or anybody,and they can do it, of course, on the apps themselves, report materialthey don't think should be on the platforms.  We then respond.</p><p>So, yes, of course, we react.  But interestingly, what we're trying todo as a sort of general strategy is move from being reactive, which ofcourse was certainly the origins in the way we tackle the lose of thisunacceptable material and become more proactive.  I gave you thatexample of a terrorist-related, ISIS-related content earlier.</p><p>STELTER:  Right.</p><p>CLEGG:  But we've just -- we've just announced for instance that ourlatest -- and we produced these transparency reports every six monthswhere we tell the world how we'll we're doing or badly we're doing inblocking or identifying unacceptable content.</p><p>And on hate speech, which, of course, is much more complicated thanterrorist-related content because one person's hate speech is anotherperson's freedom of expression.  But on hate speech, our proactivesystems and our identifying close to 65 percent of hate speechmaterial before anyone sees it, which is up from 24 percent about ayear ago.  So, we're getting better.  Yes, we need, of course, thecooperation of other folk to be able to report material to us.</p><p>There is so much volume.  The volume, of course, that we're dealingwith is enormous.  Over 100 billion messages are communicated acrossour platforms.  That's just messages every day.</p><p>So I think we're getting better.  I think we do of course need tocooperate with others.  We do need new rules of the road, but I don'tthink it would be sensible for anyone, obviously, not for Facebook'spoint of view, but actually not for society's point of view as a wholeif instead we were going to start dismantling the company all togetherand as Chris Hughes argued -- and tell you, folk in Europe, MarkZuckerberg was in Paris just on Thursday and Friday talking toregulators there and to President Macron, and I strongly suspect folkin China well, we're looking dismayed at the idea that Americandecision makers want to break up successful American companies.</p><p>It's oddly enough, only a debate which is being sort of lead here, notin other jurisdictions.</p><p>STELTER:  Well, this is about costs and benefits, and we just need toreduce -- all of us collectively need to reduce the costs of theseplatforms and raise the benefits.</p><p>CLEGG:  Yes, totally.</p><p>STELTER:  You used to be a deputy prime minister of the U.K.  Why didyou decide to join Facebook now?</p><p>CLEGG:  Because I think there is debate about the kind of -- thefrontier, if I could put it like that between tech and society atlarge, our democracy, our privacy and so on is one of the mostimportant, one of the most fraught, yes, one of the most difficult andcontroversial debates around.  So when I was asked by Mark Zuckerbergand Sheryl Sandberg whether I wanted to join them not just on thecommunication side of things but I also run Facebook's policies.</p><p>STELTER:  Right.</p><p>CLEGG:  You know, for me, of course, that is a fantastic opportunityto play, I hope, a helpful role in ensuring that Facebook plays inturn a responsible role in this evolving debate, because, look, theway that the rules of the Internet are drawn today in my view orrather not drawn will be quite different to the way they are drawn in10 years time.</p><p>And I think big tech companies have a choice.  Either they play balland they try and play a responsible role in that debate or they tryand duck it all together.  And the moment that I heard from MarkZuckerberg that he wants Facebook to play an active and responsiblerole in helping to forge partnerships with regulations and governmentsaround the world so that we get these rules right for the future andfor future generations and, of course, for me that is a veryinteresting, interesting challenge.</p><p>STELTER:  Nick, thanks so much for coming on.  Please come back soon.</p><p>CLEGG:  Thank you.</p><p>STELTER:  Maybe we'll do it over Facebook Live next time.</p><p>CLEGG:  OK.  Thank you, thank you.</p><p>STELTER:  When we come back, the panel is back with me in just amoment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:18:22] STELTER:  Hey, welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES.  I'm BrianStelter.</p><p>Democracy in the United States is being tested.  Every day brings newheadlines about more subpoenas and more legal spats and morestonewalling.  Democrats say we're in a constitutional crisis.  And Ijust keep asking myself how are news consumers and how are citizenssupposed to make sense of this?</p><p>Now, the panel is back here with me now, Jess McIntosh, Julian Zelizerand Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Catherine, if I had to have you summarize this week in all of thesedramatic developments in a headline, in a one-sentence headline, whatwould it be?</p><p>RAMPELL:  I would say the frog has been boiled.</p><p>STELTER:  Really?</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.STELTER:  We're at that point now?</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.  You know, I'm referring to if you put a progress in apot of water and you slowly raise the temperature, the frog won't jumpout, right, because they don't get they are about to be boiled.</p><p>Look, I think that the public is basically become inured to the ideathat Trump is just going to break norms, break laws, violate theConstitution, violate pretty clear statutes and that's just Trumpbeing Trump, you know?  It not a threat to democracy, that there is noconstitutional crisis, that it's all outrage and blends together andit's drama playing out.</p><p>STELTER:  The situation you're describing is kind of scary, though.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p>STELTER:  Jess, you laughed at the idea of the frog.  I think laughingin agreement.  What would your headline be?</p><p>JESS MCINTOSH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Trump is banking that youcan't keep up.  I think the headline from this week is that there weretoo many headlines and he's, he is absolutely putting all of his faithin the fact that the American people do not have time to follow allthe twists and turns of mechanizations of what he's trying to hide,the things he's stone walling on, the pieces of information he'srefusing to give up after being legally compelled to do so.</p><p>[11:20:05] People are busy.  They have jobs and lives and families.They're not able to follow a 24-hour -- I'm hardly able to follow a24-hour news cycle.</p><p>STELTER:  But you're coming to this as a liberal commentator, what doyou want the press to do differently?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  What I really want is to put pressure on the RepublicanParty at this point.  The only reason why we're in a constitutionalcrisis, the framers actually saw the chance that we might have apresident who refused to compile by the rule of law.  What they didn'tsee was that the entire political party who got him there would beengaged in helping them undermine our own democracy.</p><p>At some point, we have to ask Republicans how much they are willing tosacrifice in the future principles in order to let this guy run awaywith everything.</p><p>STELTER:  Julian, your headline this week, it's in \"The WashingtonPost\".  It's in today's paper.  It says Democrats are complicit ifthey don't impeach Trump.  The headline print is, it's time forimpeachment.</p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure, I think we are at amoment of impeachment proceedings.  My headline would be --</p><p>STELTER:  But we're not actually there in Washington.</p><p>ZELIZER: Well, that would be the headline, time for Congress to act.</p><p>I don't think we can depend on the public to sort through everything.That is why we have a House of Representatives.  I think the Muellerreport changed the dynamics in terms of putting a pretty troublingpicture out there for the public.</p><p>And just as important, this blanket stone wall that we have seen sincethe release of the report is unprecedented, in terms of usingpresidential power.  So now the Republicans are, they are complicit inletting this just go.  But House Democrats do have the authority andthey have to make a decision, do we start an impeachment process andthat's on the table.</p><p>STELTER:  And there's all this debate about the trade war, as well.</p><p>Catherine, you wrote a column this week titled, Trump's -- it's hotair and debt, that's what he's used over the years, over the decadesreally.  Hot air and debt.</p><p>RAMPELL:  I think what we have seen is that while many of us,including myself, used to say, oh, well, Trump says he's going to rungovernment like a business.  There is no relevance between managing amajor company and managing the federal government.</p><p>In fact, he's used a lot of same business practices that succeeded inhis business and applied them to the presidency which helped him andhurt the rest of us, including the idea that, you know, he treats thetax code, the law, the Constitution, as just an opening offer and thenhe uses the threat of unending litigation, of exhausting litigation,to basically get the other side, the side that has the law or theConstitution or tax code or legally binding contract or what-have-youon its side to get them to cede ground.</p><p>And I think that's a lesson he took from his business.  That's thelesson he's applying to the presidency.  He's done it with otherthings from his business, as well.</p><p>I mean, the headline refers to, you know, a lot of the debt he ran upwithin his company, but also the debt that he's run up within theUnited States.  He's kind of engaged in the same pump and dump policyeconomic style that the \"New York Times\" reported he engaged in in hisprivate business.</p><p>So, that's what I think we're seeing here.  That a lot of this sort ofunsavory aspects of trickery that helped him do well in a privatecompany he's using for ill.</p><p>STELTER:  We need to see it for what it is.  When it comes to the hotair and constant tweets, see it for what it is.</p><p>Let me turn to something you did this week on Capitol Hill, kind ofinteresting.  We broke this on CNN.com earlier about Fox trying to getmore Democrats on the air and more importantly, Democrats trying toget on Fox.  Democrats in the House of Representatives went to atraining session called \"Winning on Fox News\".</p><p>And you were one of the teachers?  Is that right word, Jess?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  One of the media trainers, yes.</p><p>STELTER:  What did you -- what did you share?</p><p>MCINTOSH:  So, I think there is a necessary debate happening in theDemocratic Party about whether or not it is appropriate to lendlegitimacy to Fox News.  Myself, I stopped appearing on Fox News a fewmonths before.</p><p>STELTER:  Even before you joined CNN --</p><p>MCINTOSH:  Even before I joined CNN, I made the decision that was notsomething I wanted to participate in as a Democratic strategist.  Isimply didn't want to help the propaganda arm of the Republican Party.</p><p>But when you're an elected official, the calculation is different.You have to represent people who might never vote for you, who mightnever share your views, and one of the only ways to get out of thismorass that we're in right now as a country is by showing folks thatthere are people there to do the right thing, who are there toaccomplish something for the people who sent them there.  I thinkthat's where the elected officials were coming from.</p><p>They -- generally, they were excited to reach this market share.There are tons of Fox viewers and not all reliable Republican voters.Some of them are -- they want to hear from Democrats in a way thatisn't tainted by the opinion folks over at Fox.  So I think thoseelected officials are excited about reaching those folks and let themknow there is more to what Democrats are doing on the Hill than whatthey are going to hear from that particular media outlet.</p><p>STELTER:  From prime time, especially.</p><p>MCINTOSH:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  To the panel, thank you so much.</p><p>Quick break here, and two more exclusive interviews.  \"TheIntercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed is standing by.  She's here toreact to another arrest of another person charged with leakinggovernment secrets to her website.</p><p>[11:25:03] And later, Chelsea Manning, her first interview since hewas released from prison last week.  Stick around.  We'll be rightback.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STELTER:  Welcome back.</p><p>This week, we got word that a former intelligence analyst named DanielHale has been hit with charges for leaking classified documents to areporter back in 2014.  He's been arrested.  He's now facing charges.</p><p>The indictment doesn't name the reporter or the outlet in question,but it's pretty clear the recipients of this alleged leak were JeremyScahill and \"The Intercept\" website.  The site came out with dronepapers back in 2015.  This was a really important investigation withinformation about Obama's drone wars.</p><p>Hale is the fifth federal employee to be charged with leakingsensitive information during the Trump administration's years.  Thisis an on going escalation of what the Obama administration was doingfor the eight years Obama was in office.</p><p>Let me bring in \"The Intercept's\" editor-in-chief Betsy Reed.  She'shere with me now in New York.</p><p>Betsey, thanks for coming over.  Happy Mother's Day.</p><p>:  Thank you, Brian.</p><p>STELTER:  I wish this was under better circumstances.</p><p>We now know of three cases where there are people accused of leakingit seems to \"The Intercept\".  What do you see going on within theDepartment of Justice as they prosecute these alleged leakers?</p><p>BETSY REED, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE INTERCEPT:  Like all journalismorganizations, we do not speak about our anonymous sources, so I can'tcomment any specifically about any of these cases.  But what I can sayis that this is part of an escalation of the war on whistle-blowersthat was launched really in earnest during the Obama administrationthat prosecuted eight journalistic sources under the Espionage Act.</p><p>[11:30:00] That is a 1919 statute that was actually designed fortraitors and spies, and it was applied against people who were reallystepping up to publicize information they thought was important forAmericans to know.  And what we've seen under Trump is an escalationof this very practice.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR:  You call them whistleblower, the otherwould say traitors.  What do you think viewers should know about thekind of information that these government officials are allegedlyproviding to reporters?</p><p>REED:  I think it's frankly preposterous to use the concept of traitorto describe someone who's brought into the public domain informationabout how the government is spying on its own citizens, how thegovernment is carry on wars around the world in secret and notallowing the public to engage in substantive debate about the factthat there are unconstitutional processes going on that it results inthe killing of American citizens abroad.</p><p>STELTER:  The idea that we deserve more information not lessespecially about America's wars is something that I think we shouldall be able to agree on but it becomes this just issue about thesources, deciding to commit a crime by leaking documents.  That's whatthe department justice is getting these individuals on.</p><p>What do you -- what do you say to people who worry about sourceprotection given that it seems like three of these investigationsinvolves people that leaked to your Web site?  Are you all doingenough to protect them?</p><p>REED:  Well we like other journalism organizations are doing our bestto deploy you know strategies like using encryption and othertechnologies that are digital security specialists help us with.  Butyou know, it's a risky business inherently doing national securityreporting.  Everybody on the beat knows that and they're knowing itincreasingly now because one of the things that we've reported a loton is surveillance, right, that the way that the governmentsurveillance ordinary citizens.</p><p>But in fact, when it comes to their own employees and contractors,that surveillance is you know, exponentially more powerful.  And sothey know everything their employees and contractors do.  They knowwhat Web sites they're reading.  They know who's printed whichdocument.  And so it is risky.  And we try to be quite upfront withpotential sources about what risks are entailed.</p><p>The fact is that deciding to become a whistleblower is a reallymomentous decision that takes a lot of courage and does entail riskthat can be mitigated but it can't be completely eradicated.</p><p>STELTER:  That's a challenge, an ongoing challenge.  Meantime, itseems like there was more of a chill in the air because of all these(INAUDIBLE), a challenge for your newsroom and for others.</p><p>REED:  Absolutely.  The Committee to Protect Journalists recently dida story that was about interviews with a number of national securityjournalists from the New York Times and other institutions and theyall said that there's a chill among their sources, that people areincreasingly afraid of coming forward with important information.</p><p>And information like you know, we learned from the Pentagon papers,from the COINTELPRO documents in the 1970s that provoked reallyimportant debates about the Vietnam War and about the FBI'sunconstitutional spying on Americans.</p><p>These are the kinds of stories that the government does not wantAmericans to know about and they will do everything in their power tostop it from coming out, which is why the work that national securityjournalists do is critically important and why every journalist shouldbe concerned about prosecutions of journalistic, alleged journalisticsources.</p><p>STELTER:  Betsy, thanks for being here.  Great to see you.</p><p>REED:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>STELTER:  Thank you.  A related story actually coming up next aboutsomeone who was arrested for leaking almost a decade ago.  Now ChelseaManning is facing jail time for a different reason.  She will join melive right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:35:00] STELTER:  Chelsea Manning was in prison for seven yearsafter leaking military and diplomatic secrets to WikiLeaks in 2010.She was facing up to 28 more years in prison when her sentence wascommuted by President Obama in 2017.  But two months ago, she was backbehind bars for refusing to testify to a grand jury in Virginia.</p><p>Prosecutors apparently wanted her to tell all about her contacts withWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.  Manning refused and said shealready told everything years ago and the judge held her in contempt.Three days ago she was released because that particular grand jury wasfinished.  But now she's facing another subpoena in just a few daysand possibly more jail time.</p><p>Chelsea Manning's joining me now here in New York.  Thank you forcoming in.</p><p>CHELSEA MANNING, FORMER INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, U.S. ARMY:  Hey, thanksfor having me.</p><p>STELTER:  What is going on with these grand juries?  What do they wantto know about Julian Assange from you?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, first off, nobody's actually -- and none of this hasany single person been specifically identified.  What they've asked mequestions about specifically are my conduct and how I did things whichI all -- which I methodically laid out in you know, hours of testimonyand a 40-page statement.</p><p>So they're really just trying to go through the same procedural youknow, the same -- the procedure of how things happened again.  And Ithink that --</p><p>STELTER:  They just want you to describe the same things again?</p><p>MANNING:  Yes, what they want to do.  So --</p><p>STELTER:  But it does seem like it's intended to be able to punishAssange further, right?  We already know he's been charged -- thegovernment seems to want to charge him with more counts and it seemsthat they want information from you for that.  Is that yourimpression?</p><p>MANNING:  I mean, I'm -- I think that's certainly my impression.  ButI think that what's interesting here is that the process of a grandjury is to obtain indictments.  We already have an indictment, so whyare we going through this process.  And I think that the kinds ofquestions that I've been asked are about disclosures and how thethings are disclosed and why they're disclosed as opposed to like thehow it was obtained.</p><p>They're -- they don't seem to be interested in how the -- and youknow, there's an enormous amount of computer forensics in this case.Like this is -- they don't need me to like do a case on like how ithappened.  They have that.  What they're really interested in is whatmy intentions were which I laid out in the testimony.  How -- you knowwhat my impressions of how that would look like would be and you know,like what -- you know how much of that would be published.  I thinkthat's more of their interest.STELTER:  And this was nine years ago that you were providing thisinformation to Julian Assange.  Some of it was cited as evidence ofwar crimes by the American government -- by the American military.This is still going off for you now nine years later.  Do you have anyregrets?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, first off, I just want to point out that I don'tactually know who I'm communicating with.  I certainly havesuspicions.  I certainly have suspicions and I believe I've laid outlike you know, I've laid out the -- in my testimony I said like youknow, like sure, there's like percentage ranges as to like who it could be,but I don't actually know who's on the other end of the of thesecommunications.</p><p>STELTER:  OK.</p><p>MANNING:  You know, so you know, the chat logs that you see, theindictment, which were in the court-martial record you know, we'vealready gone over this.  You know, I've said as much as I can sayabout that.  Now then, as to whether it -- I have any regrets youknow, like I -- it's -- I don't relitigate things.</p><p>Like I did what I did with the information that I had, the knowledgethat I had, and the tools and resources I had at the time.  The simplefact of the matter is that in 2010 -- you know, in 2010 when all this-- you know, all this happen it was very different you know,landscape.  You know, they -- even just trying to -- like I reachedout to the New York Times and The Washington Post.</p><p>I reached out to the Washington Post first because I actually seen allthe presidents meant so you know, so it was just this technologicalbarrier, you know, the lack of encryption tools, the lack of knowledgeabout -- on the part of reporters about how to protect -- you know,how to -- about how to communicate and verify this kind ofinformation.</p><p>[11:40:48] STELTER:  But WikiLeaks did know how.  Do you view theprosecution of Assange as a threat to press freedom?</p><p>MANNING:  I mean, I think that -- I think that the Eastern District ofVirginia is now turning into a rubber stamp for all these differentprosecutions that really are going after you know -- and I think thatultimately what they really want is they want to go after journalists.</p><p>Like the-- like the -- this administration clearly wants to go afterjournalists.  I think that if the administration gets its way as itslaid out you know, in repeated statements like the media is the enemyof the people kind of thing, you know -- you know, then I think thatwe're going to see that you know national security journalists and youknow a lot of -- a lot of disruptive you know, for this administrationpress.  We're probably going to see you know indictments and charges,you know, but perhaps indirectly related.</p><p>And the average American commits -- you know, there's so many offederal offenses.  The average American commits three felonies a day.So whenever journalism it makes a misstep, I think that they're put onnotice now that the FBI and the Department of Justice are going to goafter them on the administration's behalf.</p><p>STELTER:  And what about you?  You're due back on Thursday.</p><p>MANNING:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  Another subpoena for another grand jury.</p><p>MANNING:  Yes.</p><p>STELTER:  What's going to happen?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, if they're asking this -- they want -- they've alreadystipulated they want to ask the same questions.  So this is not about-- this is not about anything new.  They're not even asking anything-- they're not even asking anything new.  I've already laid all ofthis out.</p><p>STELTER:  So you're going to refuse again.</p><p>MANNING:  I am going to refuse.  I don't -- I think that this grandjury is an -- I mean, I think that all grand juries are improper.  Idon't like the secrecy of it.  One of the reasons why the -- why wehad so much -- why there was so much secrecy and speculation and likeso much like ham hand-wringing over the Mueller report was because ofthe secrecy.</p><p>We would know -- we would know far more if we would just have publichearings, bring the stuff out there and like you know -- and I did.  Itestified you know, before an open court with all these journaliststhere.  Like I have nothing new to provide.</p><p>STELTER:  But they want to hear from you again.  That's the law.  Willyou be back in jail next weekend?</p><p>MANNING:  Well, I'd be -- it's going to depend on -- we certainly havea motion to quash.  We're certainly going to raise every single legalchallenge.  We have -- we have very -- you know, we have a very strongcase.  We had a strong case previously but now we have additionalevidence as to what our case is.</p><p>STELTER:  So it's up in the air.  We don't know if you'll be sentencedto jail or not again.</p><p>MANNING:  We don't.  But you know, I think that we have a muchstronger case in terms of like the legal objections which you know,the previous judge didn't -- he refused to even hear.  He refused toeven hear them or act on the motions.  He just simply placed me incontempt and ignored our motions.</p><p>STELTER:  We talk all the time about unprincipled politicians and whatyou're doing is an act of principle whether viewers agree with it ornot, I can see that.  Chelsea thanks for being here.</p><p>MANNING:  Thank you.STELTER:  Great talking with you.  A quick break here and when we comeback, Carl Bernstein talking about all the week's news trying to putit all together.  We'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[11:45:00] STELTER:  So many Trump-related storylines are convergingall of them convoluted but many pointing in the same direction towardpresidential abuses of power.  So are members of the media living upto this challenge?  Let's ask Carl Bernstein.  He's here with me inNew York.  Carl, that's the question.  Are we living up to this momentin history?</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, by we if you mean thepress, I think -- I think yes.  Our institutions, so far the answeris, not hardly.</p><p>STELTER:  You mean the Congress?</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Well, the Congress of the United States particularlybecause there has been no real bipartisan investigation of the mostauthoritarian president in our history, probably.  And let's go backto basics here that we find ourselves in this situation right nowbecause there is an ongoing cover-up by the President of the UnitedStates.</p><p>Whether that constitutes a violation of law, whether he is a criminalor not, that's for down the road.  But right now it's obvious toanyone who watches, anyone who looks at the facts, reads the MuellerReport, the obstruction part, particularly, we are in the midst of acontinuing cover-up by the president aided and abetted by the AttorneyGeneral of the United States.</p><p>Trump said he wanted his Roy Cohn.  He's got him now in the AttorneyGeneral.  And where this is taking us is to an unprecedented place.It's not about a constitutional crisis, this is a systemic crisischallenging whether our institutions are able to function in thiscountry to deal with a president of the United States who is unique inour history, who has nothing but contempt for democratic tradition andthe rule of law.</p><p>So really where the rubber is going to meet the road is going to bethe Supreme Court of the United States.  And Chief Justice Roberts hasgot his table being set for him in a way that may have an awful lot todo with the future of American democracy.</p><p>STELTER:  You say systemic crisis though.  I think I hear his fansaying Trump just being a tough guy.  He's just holding on to hispower.  That's what every president would do.  They would say he's notso different from the past presidents.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Well, he's very different from past presidents.</p><p>STELTER  But I feel like Fox News viewers are fed about this narrativeabout Obama and other Democrats and make them all the same. BERNSTEIN:  Look, we can't -- we can't do anything about Fox News andwhat they feed their audience anymore.  What we need to do in thepress is to continue our reporting.  There is wide open area forreporting.  Look what the Wall Street Journal owned by the same personwho owns Fox News -- Fox News Rupert Murdoch reported last week aboutMcGahn stiffing the President of the United States and saying he wouldnot go and tell the Congress of the United States and others that thePresident had not obstructed justice, refused to do it.  Who producedthat story?</p><p>STELTER:  The Murdochs.  That's a great point</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  The Murdoch press.  So let's continue to do what we dobest.  You know, look at the tax story that the New York Times didshowing us that we have a grifter president of the United States, atax cheat, someone who is a fraud in business which is demonstrablewhich you've had his biographers who say the same thing, and now weare seeing the fraudulence through what the press is reporting today.</p><p>We need to be looking at the relationship of the Trump businessorganization with Russia and Russians and ethno Russians.  There'splenty of room for original reporting.  And incidentally, if thisstory were to go in some direction, that by some miracle exoneratedPresident Trump, so be it.</p><p>[11:50:35] STELTER:  That would be a good thing for the country.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  But so far -- so far all the evidence particularly theMueller report is so overwhelming.  And also, this is no exonerationabout his conduct in terms of Russia and Russian contacts.  That's notwhat the Mueller report says.</p><p>STELTER:  The Mueller report, let's talk more about that Muellerreport in just a moment.  We'll be right back more with Carl in just amoment here on RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STELTER:  Carl Bernstein is back with me here.  And Carl, I just wantto note, the Mueller report has stayed in power.  Look at this, numberone and two on the New York Times bestseller list this week.  Prettyimpressive for a free you know, free PDF.  All this talk about RobertMueller testifying, when will he -- will it happen, how important isit we hear from Mueller on television?</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  I think -- well, I think it's essential, whether hetestifies before the committee or whether he chooses another venue.If the president claims executive privilege before that body, perhapsthere's another venue that Mueller might choose, such as going ontelevision himself or members of his staff in such a way that theydon't reveal perhaps information that shouldn't be revealed forreasons of grand jury secrecy at the moment and at the same time, tellthe story about what this investigation was about and what it reallyfound.</p><p>We need to hear from that investigation, those who conducted theinvestigation and we also need the full report.  It is essential thatthe American people have the full report through their representativesin Congress, every word of it.  And there's one other thing we can'tforget.  There is an ongoing national security, counterintelligenceinvestigation that was not part of the Mueller report that is ongoing.</p><p>There is much more that is going to be learned I think we can say withsome absolute foreknowledge about what happened with Russians and whathappened with the Trump campaign and people around him.  But this ideaof the President getting up and claiming some kind of completeexoneration, I think it's necessary perhaps on some of our times onthe air, maybe we ought to read out loud and put up exactly what thereport said about that.  It did not say we exonerate the president.</p><p>[11:55:46] STELTER:  Right.  When Mitch McConnell says case closed, weshould show that the case is open.  Carl, thanks for being here.Great to see you.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Great to be here.</p><p>STELTER:  I appreciate it.</p><p>BERNSTEIN:  Thanks.</p><p>STELTER:  Happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching, especially mywife, my mom, my mother-in-law.
